Meanwhile, Mr Juncker has insisted there is no prospect of reopening the Withdrawal Agreement.Here, body language expert Judi James looks at how the encounters between the key players in Brussels went: May and Tusk Judging from May’s wintry facial expression and lack of eye contact or even recognition of Tusk here I’d suggest she really did issue a ‘Nebulous?’-style roasting over his ‘place in hell’ comments.The two leaders share some similarities in body language demeanour here but with some telling, intrinsic differences. Standing together side by side for their photo-call their cold, unsmiling expressions and the way they both stand to attention with their arms down at their sides suggest mutual frostiness. However May’s cold-eye stare involves a slightly heavier top lid that could make it look more measured and menacing (Think Dirty Harry). It’s a reflective look of what could pass as steely anger, which is endorsed by the way she pulls her chin into her neck. Her lips are tight but not clamped and there appears to be a surprising lack of tension in her hands, which dangle loosely at her sides.Tusk is more openly in fight mode here and seemingly more in the moment. His shoulders are pulled back while his neck is stuck forward. His mouth is clamped shit and his chin juts. His cold stare is wide-eyed and focused with one brow raised. His arms mirror May’s pose but whereas his left hand hangs like hers his right is partly balled into a fist.            Body language expert Judi James looked at how the encounters between Theresa May and Donald Tusk went today             The talks with Mr Tusk (pictured) appear to have been extremely tense as the Brexit pressure begins to fray tempers              Theresa May said she confronted Donald Tusk (pictured together in Brussels today) about his \u0027unhelpful\u0027 barb about Brexiteers having a \u0027special place in Hell\u0027\u0027They would ide Hell\u0027: Another Brussels boss takes aim at...¿They would even manage to ide Hell¿: EU Brexit...Donald Tusk admits hopes of holding second referendum to...Donald Trump will visit London in December for a Nato...Labour unity shatters as Remainer MPs warn they could QUIT...Share this articleThe difference in their poses suggest May might excel in intimidation while Tusk’s suggests more active battling. His right hand could hint at some fear but his eye expression and his signals of aggressive arousal suggest he’ll be spoiling for a fight and averse to any form of public climb-down.The body language signals were similar at the meeting. May is the only one not attempting to smile at the meeting and also the only one not showing their hands by placing them under rather than on the table. This could suggest a desire to show she’s got something up her sleeve or that she’s keeping her thoughts hidden or masked but it also creates a self-diminished look that might not be ideal for a tough meeting where the grim smiles of the others suggest they’re almost spoiling for a fight.May and Juncker It would be natural and appropriate at this stage of the negotiations for both sides to put in a performance of aggressive masking to imply a tough, recalcitrant stance. This would be the weigh-in moment for a prize-fighter and both Juncker and especially May will be keen to suggest toughness and resolve via their body language, not just to each other in a bid to intimidate, but in May\u0027s case it is also Parliament and the electorate who are expecting to see naked steel rather than any suggestion of a weak, polite and smiling cave-in.May previously began her transformation from nice guy to Terminator with the \u0027Nebulous?\u0027 photo-opportunity where she appeared to be giving the normally tactile and amenable-looking Juncker a prime roasting.Now she has turned up the heat or – to be precise – added further layers to the perma-frost, with this emphatic and deliberate display of coldness and possible anger at today\u0027s meetings in Brussels.May arrives walking at a fair lick, which is guaranteed to leave the less agile Juncker playing catch-up behind her.She also walks a pace away to the side from Juncker with what looks like an apparent desire to ignore his presence altogether. Her walk is purposeful, bordering on a march.Unlike some much fonder-looking displays from past meetings, May faces front for the photo-call, again with a large spatial gap.            Body language expert Judi James looked at how the encounters between Theresa May and Jean Claude Juncker went in Brussels today      Mrs May was careful not to smile as she greeted Mr Juncker at the European commission headquarters in Brussels today            Earlier, the PM and the EU commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker - usually known for his exuberant touchy-feely style - stood grim-faced next to each other before disappearing for private talks             The body language between Mrs May and Mr Juncker was distinctly frosty as they met before the crucial talks today     The two leaders went on from the grim-faced photo opportunity to have a \u0027robust\u0027 discussion - often seen as diplomatic code for a blazing row   Juncker offers no intentional gesture for his shake and May still holds her arms down by her sides as Juncker pokes his hand out quickly as though sticking it into the flames of an oven. There is a lack of eye contact to suggest any form or rapport or like-minded thinking. When their eyes do meet over the shake the prize-fighter theme continues with the exchange of a cold, hard stare. Juncker\u0027s feet are partially turned in towards May but hers remain resolutely pointing forward and when Juncker does pull his hand away she breaks from the eye contact with a skittish head-toss that could imply derision.May is normally polite with her body language signals but her side-eye stare and then her mouth clamp with her head raised and her chin pulled into her neck suggest open annoyance and exasperation. Juncker\u0027s pursed lips and the way he looks down as he offer his hand suggest a less dramatic form of stubbornness but overall he does look like a man who might not see what she is hoping to achieve by her meetings. In the end she stormed off stage leaving Juncker trailing behind but whereas he looked amused and even slightly apologetic during \u0027Nebulous-gate\u0027, here he looks more like a man who is just plain baffled. He did place one dominant, ushering hand on May\u0027s back as she turned to leave but after that he was just treated to a view of her heels as she set off at warp speed. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/18/21/5060084900000578-0-image-m-8_1537302336573.jpg","title":"Supermodel Christie Brinkley said felt younger 65 whats spirit age","story":"    Supermodel Christie Brinkley celebrated with friends and family at her 65th Birthday party in New York last TuesdayI have a clear memory of staring at the long looking-glass in my mother\u0027s bedroom on February 6, 1969 — my 6th birthday — and thinking: \u0027This is the business!\u0027 I was wearing the uniform of a school where I was about to become the youngest pupil and I felt I had escaped kiddiehood.A. A. Milne\u0027s poem Now We Are Six ends: \u0027But now I am six, I\u0027m as clever as clever. So I think I\u0027ll be six now for ever and ever.\u0027 That\u0027s how I felt that day. Over subsequent decades my \u0027spirit age\u0027 was mostly far older than my real vintage.The first LP I bought, aged 12, from the Cirencester branch of FW Woolworth, was Bach\u0027s Brandenburg Concertos. As a teenager I ached to wear baggy corduroys and smoke a pipe. I have owned only one pair of jeans and they were not a success.          Quentin Letts says his spirit age is around one year older than his actual age At university in Ireland I hated the pressure to be \u0027with it\u0027 and dated a beautiful Belfast artist who was ten years my senior. As a 30-year-old reporter, I envied older journalists who had seen the world and mastered their craft.When I married Lois in 1996, I knew she was a cracker yet felt itchy when grannies cooed over us as \u0027love\u0027s young dream\u0027 and told us: \u0027It\u0027s all in front of you.\u0027 I didn\u0027t want to be young. I wanted to be established, successful, my own man, with a lawnmower and a drinks cabinet and shoe-trees.Now I\u0027ve got them and it feels right.In The Idiot, Dostoyevsky writes that 56 is the age at which real life can begin: a \u0027fine complexion, sound though discoloured teeth, a stocky, solid figure, a preoccupied air in the morning, a gay face in the evening\u0027.There is also, though this he omitted, a disposition to pity anyone younger, and a sense of relief to have left behind youth\u0027s gulping gawkishness. Thank heavens for middle age.EVEN AT 56 I STILL GET SCHOOLGIRL CRUSHESSusannah ConstantineReal age: 56. Spirit age: 16.          Susannah Constantine \u0027still get schoolgirl crushes\u0027So, Christie Brinkley jokes that she\u0027s turning 50 for the 15th time, declaring her spirit age is far younger than her 65 years. Why has she chosen an age that is ten years older than she looks?When it comes to how I feel, I\u0027d put it at somewhere around 16. I still get schoolgirl crushes and it would be wonderful to have no responsibilities. Often, I see myself in my children and it makes me laugh when I tell them to behave or grow up, when inside I\u0027m wanting to do exactly the same as them, despite the statins, hot flushes and insomnia.I yearn to eat rubbish as often as I like without pumping up the cholesterol levels. I\u0027d love to be able to sleep until noon. It would be heaven to have a night on the tiles and not look like stale bread the next morning.Sadly, at the ripe old age of 56, it would be unwise to live my spiritual age because it could take me to an early grave.    Henry Deedes\u0027s spirit age is the age he got married My spirit age — 28 — is the age I got married. That\u0027s not a dig at my ex-wife, we had many wonderful times. Still do. But I feel younger now than I did then.Midlife complacency set in prematurely after marrying. The burden of responsibility meant I neglected myself.Week nights covering the canape-and-Krug party circuit had left my skin sallow, my belly blubberous. Home life was often a whir of bills and builders as I tottered under the weight of a mortgage bigger than the Brexit orce fee.These days, I eat better, drink less and am mildly more solvent. Frequent exercise means I can wear T-shirts again without feeling like a lager-tummied extra from Benidorm. That feeling of youthful spontaneity is wonderful. I have a sense of adventure again.Every now and again I get a quick reality check. Hangovers get harder. Hair gets greyer. And yesterday I ordered a hip support from Amazon to wear in the gym — but let\u0027s not dwell on that.CHILDREN CAN TELL I\u0027M NOT A GROWN-UPRowan PellingReal age: 51. Spirit age: 15.I have never lied about my age and told everyone when I turned 50 last year. But that might be because I am certain, deep down, that the largest part of me remains resolutely 15.          Rowan Pelling never lied about her age I have spent my life avoiding certain adult responsibilities (tax returns, form-filling, housework, the duller side of childrearing) and veering off into my own vivid, imaginary world.I still make the kind of intense friendships I made at school and like sloping away from chores like a naughty schoolgirl having a ciggie behind the bike sheds.My life would have fallen apart, I suspect, if I hadn\u0027t married a proper grown-up who provides the necessary domestic balance. I happily wear clothes many peers would judge to be age-inappropriate, such as skinny jeans, short skirts and bikinis, and only yesterday I received a Sex Pistols T-shirt in the post.Children (little girls in particular) often recognise I\u0027m not a real grown-up and are happy to talk to me about unicorns, imaginary friends and dragons. If there\u0027s a trampoline or a game of \u0027It\u0027, I\u0027m first in the queue.My chief guilty pleasure is nestling in an armchair with a clutch of favourite children\u0027s books.I don\u0027t think I chase youth: I\u0027ve never had Botox or filler and I\u0027m happy with my wrinkles. But I suspect feeling young is what makes a person buzz, not looking it. If I were ever to have a tattoo, then it would say simply: \u0027There are no rules.\u0027IN MY DREAMS I\u0027M 17 AND A RUGBY HEROStanley JohnsonReal age: 78. Spirit age: 17.          Stanley Johnson dreams of being a rugby hero Even now, I dream about my schooldays when I played prop in rugby for Sherborne, aged 17.The other side (Marlborough? Clifton?) kicks off. I catch the ball full-toss and charge straight for the line, looking neither right nor left, to score under the posts.Of course, I\u0027m not arguing that the grit and determination you acquire on the rugger field as a schoolboy is the end of the story. Yes, I wanted to gain a rugger blue at Oxford after I left school, but I also wanted to get a First and be President of the Union.As it happened, I flunked all three goals, but there was one great consolation prize which I have cherished all my life: I won the Newdigate Prize for poetry with a 98-line poem called May Morning. I had to recite it at the university\u0027s summer prize-giving ceremony, Encaenia.Charlie Chaplin was one of those honoured that year. He signed my programme and, 56 years later, I still have it.In a nutshell, my spirit age still hovers around 17. I have the sense that even though I hung up my boots years ago, it\u0027s worth charging full-tilt towards the goal.BEING A YOUNG DAD WAS THE BEST TIMERay ConnollyReal age: 78. Spirit age: 29.Emotionally frozen at the age of 29, that\u0027s what I was. That\u0027s how I still think of myself.It was the age when I became confident that I knew how to do what I was good at.We bought a big, run-down house on my 29th birthday in 1970 and it felt like a new beginning, setting off on a new adventure with a future rich in hope and possibilities.          Ray Connolly is \u0027frozen at the age of 29\u0027That was also the time when I was a young father. I liked the role of being a dad — I still do. Not the sort of dad who helped much around the house, more the type who saw children as people to amuse and who enjoyed being amused by them.I expect lots of men identify with being in their late teens — which suggests to me they must have had more success with girls at that age than I did. Marrying Plum when I was 25 was the best thing I ever did. We\u0027ve grown old together, but still reckon the years when the children were small were the best.It was hard, of course. Not much money, two children and soon another on the way, redecorating all four floors of our home in the evenings — Wedgwood blue and white panels nearly everywhere.Not everything has turned out as I hoped. There have been some mistakes — like selling that perfect house — and setbacks. But I\u0027m still happily working seven days a week, still getting new ideas and beginning new projects. Still feeling all of 29.WE GRANNIES ARE FULL OF ENERGYLynne FranksReal age: 70. Spirit age: 30.I have been in my early 30s for almost 40 years. Although clearly my body is older, my enthusiasm for new projects and my energy are the same, and my creativity is as full-on.          Lynne Franks has \u0027been in my early 30s for almost 40 years\u0027At 70, I am opening three new businesses, have moved to a new home in Somerset where I\u0027ve never lived before, and am still optimistic about love and romance.I know good health is vital to keeping up my energy and I eat well, take the best natural supplements and stay as physically active as I have time for, with regular boxing sessions, daily dog walks, tennis lessons and dancing.But I think it\u0027s my love of life and excitement for what each day will bring that keep me feeling less than half my biological age.I meet so many women in my work as a coach and mentor who are my age and planning their next career. It\u0027s as if being grandmothers and well past the menopause has given us a new lease of life.Laughter, love, creative ideas, hugs and a belief that we can work together to create a new and better kind of world is what keeps me and my friends spiritually 30.IS IT TIME I FOUND A PROPER JOB?Libby PurvesReal age: 69. Spirit age: 27.If you\u0027re a freelance, your spirit age stays shamefully young. Actors and musicians know the feeling, too, and I suspect a lot of us still unconsciously feel about 27.It\u0027s understandable: you have never been a serious employee, corporate executive or brisk office manager never been eligible for a company pension, sick pay, maternity leave or an unfair-dismissal tribunal. So you roam the landscape as bright-eyed and wary as a weasel.          Libby Purves says freelancing keeps you \u0027shamefully young\u0027You always wonder about the next contract or the next gig, and never mind being busy you remember how the young Roy Hudd, complaining of overwork, was told by a grand, old, end-of-the-pier agent: \u0027Roy, a full date-book is a happy pro!\u0027You rather relish the sense of adventure involved in professional insecurity, wondering who might try to hire you next and if you would match up to their style, or be able to tolerate the management\u0027s notorious attitude problem.Like a twentysomething between boyfriends, you have a giddy sense that something intriguing and wonderful might be just around the corner. And when it isn\u0027t, you learn to laugh it off and scrounge around for anything that\u0027s going.Yet you\u0027re not a callow teenager: by the mid-20s you had learned to accept nasty rejection without falling into a furious depression.At the same time, you have started to know your value and your price and nerve yourself occasionally to say: \u0027No.\u0027But always there\u0027s that roving eye for a new chance, and a faint sense that maybe you ought to be looking for a \u0027proper job\u0027.Even when I had two small children and lived in a Suffolk field, it was impossible not to read the situations vacant column and go into some mad fantasy of retraining as a psychiatric nurse, PE teacher or automotive bodyshop manager.And, shame to say, I still do.Royalty, presidents and \u0027the most famous elevator ride in...Michael Avenatti\u0027s estranged wife says she wishes he would...\u0027She is super smart and has great energy\u0027: Stormy Daniels\u0027...Firing up viewers: Today scores best ratings in two years...Share this article    Roger Alton says his body feels 171My passport says I\u0027m 71, but most of the time my body feels 171.Especially in the morning (come on knees, do your stuff and get out of bed) or the afternoon (try not to snooze with your mouth open), not to mention the evening (have a shower, not a bath, or you\u0027ll never get out). Then there\u0027s the nights (not the bloody loo again).All a bit embarrassing for a chap who still thinks he\u0027s 34 — physically, socially and professionally in the prime of life, with a rich circle of sporting and friendship associates. Eh! Who are you kidding?\u0027Hi guys. Any chance of a game? I heard you were short and I\u0027ve got my kit.\u0027\u0027Actually, it\u0027s OK. But we\u0027d love it if you would make the tea.\u0027I am not alone: Sergio Parisse, veteran captain of the beleaguered Italian rugby team, was asked if he was thinking of retiring before his team played Scotland last weekend.Not really, he said. \u0027In my head I\u0027m still 16.\u0027I know how he feels. Now, if I can only get up and head for bed . . .YES, THERE\u0027S LIFE BEYOND STRICTLYJohn SergeantReal age: 74. Spirit Age: 74.          John Sergeant feels his exact age I get worried when a young person says: \u0027I\u0027m going to go round the world and try to find myself.\u0027This attempt is unlikely to succeed — for we have many selves, from diligent child to grumpy old man, via many other characters on the way.One of my great joys has been being able to take part in a contrasting range of activities, be it Strictly Come Dancing or reporting Parliament and, somehow, making each one my own.To thine own self be true — but I have preferred to be true to mine own selves.My spirit age is highly variable. Sometimes I feel like a teenager, reluctant to get out of bed in the morning. Running up stairs is now a fairly rare pleasure — I am more likely to imagine that my 90th birthday looms.My spirit age also changes as the year progresses. At the moment I have adapted well to being 74.I feel plenty of adventures still lie ahead. But in just over two months I will be 75, and that is a source of unease.I think the best plan is to set my spirit age at 74 until I am ready to take stock."},{"url":null,"title":"Sarah Silverman describes uncomfortable breast ultrasound arrogant male doctor","story":"Sarah Silverman described her uncomfortable visit to the doctor Wednesday          In a lengthy Instagram post, she said the male radiologist began conversing with her while her breasts were exposedSilverman starts by explaining that she had to get an ultrasound after a mammogram Wednesday because she has \u0027dense breasts\u0027. She says the radiologist is the same man she had last year and goes on to explain why she dislikes him.  \u0027He started talking to me about my chest X-ray (I also got a chest X-Ray) and was pontificating with my boobs just out and covered in gel and cold and finally I said \u0027\u0027Hey-can we either talk about this when I’m dressed or WHILE your doing the ultrasound?

I tried to ring Kelly and said I would be off this week, and Kelly said I could not see them at the drop of a hat. \u0027Every time I phoned her it would be inconvenient. There would be \u0027family business\u0027 to see to, or \u0027we are taking them here, or there\u0027\u0027.\u0027The last time was a heated discussion. It was getting to the point where you are beaten down by it. I wanted to see the children.\u0027          Her mother Kelly Peat (pictured) didn\u0027t report her missing for almost eight hours after going to the supermarket and having supperMr Cook said that during their last conversation, Kelly told him: \u0027You just can\u0027t see them when you want to.\u0027The inquest heard he considered talking to a solicitor, but didn\u0027t feel he \u0027had a leg to stand on\u0027.At some point around March 2013, he went to their home – but found it was empty.Mr Cook said: \u0027I went to a friends\u0027 house on the estate, but they said that one morning they woke up and they had upped and gone. I had no idea where they\u0027d gone.\u0027He added the next contact he had with the Peats was on the day after Amber disappeared. Mr Cook told the hearing: \u0027I found out in Facebook so I tried to contact Kelly with the number off the missing person posters.\u0027I got vile abuse off Danny – \u0027she is not your f****** daughter, she wants nothing to do with you, you are nothing but a sperm donor.\u0027I phoned back again and spoke to Danny\u0027s mum.

I was in deep shock about it.\u0027He added he didn\u0027t know about any issues surrounding his daughter that the inquest had heard about, including her running away from home previously and problems at school.Mr Cook\u0027s mother Jennifer Lancaster – Amber\u0027s grandmother – then gave evidence.She described her granddaughter as a \u0027lovely, sweet, lovable child\u0027 who \u0027liked to cuddle and play silly girly things like dressing up, and with her make-up bag\u0027.Mrs Lancaster said she saw Amber \u0027quite frequently\u0027 when she was young – but when her son and Kelly split up she only saw her \u0027two or three\u0027 times before her death.One of the occasions was Valentines\u0027 Day in 2013, when Danny wanted to cook Kelly a \u0027romantic meal\u0027 and the children went to stay with her for the weekend.           Danny Peat walks to the Nottingham inquest today alongside an unknown woman   Amber Peat\u0027s biological father Adrian Cook (left) arrived at the inquest of his daughter\u0027s death for the first time today, as the 13-year-old tragic schoolgirl\u0027s grandparents prepared to give evidence But Mrs Lancaster said Amber was \u0027weepy\u0027 because she had overheard a conversation between Kelly and her mother, Dianne Gillibrand, in which they had said she \u0027wouldn\u0027t want them.\u0027Mrs Lancaster said: \u0027I told them I would always want them. How can you not want two little children like that, that give you so much pleasure? It struck me as odd.\u0027Mrs Lancaster next saw the young siblings on Mother\u0027s Day 2013, but they couldn\u0027t stop for long because Kelly was waiting in her car outside. She gave them a pair of charm bracelets, and expected to see them again before she went into hospital that April for a knee operation – but never did.She told the hearing: \u0027I got a message from Kelly to say they loved the bracelets, and that was it. I bought them Easter eggs and sent a message to see if they would be coming for them. \u0027And I wanted to get Amber a birthday present because I was going in hospital. But the message (back) was, \u0027don\u0027t know, not sure\u0027. That was it.\u0027Mrs Lancaster added that she went to the family home in a bid to see them – but found they had moved.When she contacted Kelly to ask for the new address – only to be told: \u0027I am not comfortable with you having it.\u0027She said: \u0027I thought, \u0027this is really strange\u0027, but that is the way it was.\u0027          Daniel Peat said to police that Amber\u0027s her \u0027only hobby was reading and she had no real friends\u0027Mrs Lancaster found out Amber had gone missing through her sister, and \u0027panicked\u0027. She said she had no concerns about her granddaughter\u0027s behaviour, and what had happened \u0027came as a shock\u0027.Referring to the Peats, she said: \u0027They trust you with their kids and then stop you seeing them, and the next thing you know she is missing.\u0027It\u0027s horrible, it really is horrible.\u0027I phoned Kelly\u0027s number and Danny answered, and I said, \u0027where is my granddaughter?\u0027 I said I need to speak to Kelly. He said, \u0027she does not want anything to do with that side of the family. So what do you do?\u0027Pausing to wipe away tears, Mrs Lancaster added: \u0027When she (Amber) passed away, I did not even get to see her at the undertakers. They had to contact Kelly.\u0027I did not realise until that point just how cruel she could be. And it is cruel. That is how it is.\u0027The inquest also heard from Kelly\u0027s mother, Dianne Gillibrand.She described Amber as having a \u0027distinctive laugh\u0027 with a \u0027vibration\u0027, adding: \u0027You would hear her before she entered the room.\u0027You would see this long black hair flying around the corner, then these beautiful eyes. She had beautiful bone structure.\u0027Asked by Ms Bower what Amber enjoyed, Mrs Gillibrand said: \u0027She liked anything adrenalin-filled. She hated sitting still.\u0027Referring to Danny, Mrs Gillibrand said: \u0027Amber met him, she found him good enough. She enjoyed his company. \u0027She chose to call him \u0027dad\u0027 and the children chose to name themselves \u0027Peat\u0027.\u0027She said, \u0027he has been more of a dad to me than my own dad, and we want to become Peats\u0027. As the inquest into Peat\u0027s death in 2015 continued into it\u0027s second week, a coroner heard she stormed out of the family home after being told to \u0027wash every pot in the house\u0027.On one occasion, Peat had been woken at 1.30am and told to mop the floors, the inquest in Nottingham was told.           Kelly Peat, and step father Danny Peat appeal for missing Amber to come home - but by that time she was already deadIn yesterday\u0027s hearing, Kelly Peat showed \u0027no emotion\u0027 after the 13-year-old fled and gave \u0027rehearsed\u0027 information to police before putting Amber\u0027s disappearance down to \u0027attention-seeking\u0027, a police officer who was called to the incident said.Amber\u0027s mother and step-father Danny Peat didn\u0027t report her missing for almost eight hours after going to the supermarket and having supper. It came as the last man to see her alive told the Nottingham inquest into her death that detectives turned up at his door two days after he reported it to them.Adam Lamb said the police asked if they could walk to where he last spotted Amber at 5.20pm on May 30 2015 and she was found hanging in the hedgerow nearby.The coroner has been told the vulnerable teenager was being \u0027emotionally abused\u0027 at home and subjected to a series of draconian punishments for \u0027undesirable behaviour\u0027.On one occasion, she claimed she had been been awoken by her stepfather at 1.30am and told to mop floors as a punishment for failing to fulfil domestic chores. Amber vanished at around 5.10pm – but wasn\u0027t reported missing until 12.56am the following day, after her parents had their dinner and went shopping.Tragically  she was already dead by that point.The eighth day of the four-week inquest heard from PC Nicola Roe, who was one of the first officers to respond to the missing persons call from Kelly.She went to the family home with a colleague and was told by the 37-year-old that Amber had stormed out of the house after being asked to clean out a cool box.Asked by coroner Laurinda Bower for her observations about Kelly, PC Roe replied: \u0027She was quite matter-of-fact about how she was describing the situation.\u0027The officer said she \u0027wasn\u0027t really surprised\u0027 because \u0027people present differently\u0027, adding: \u0027She seemed tired but not particularly emotional. Not upset, maybe frustrated.\u0027She explained the background that she had gone missing previously in similar circumstances, and referred to her throwing temper tantrums and attention-seeking behaviour.\u0027PC Roe said the family \u0027seemed quite well rehearsed in giving information to the police\u0027, and \u0027the general consensus was they expected her back the next morning\u0027.She added: \u0027They said she normally came back at night and that is why they left it quite late to report it.\u0027The inquest also heard from PC Kay Yelland, who visited the family home more than 24 hours after Amber walked out in order to \u0027gain more information\u0027, and found a \u0027group of people\u0027 gathered there.          The family did not report Amber missing until they had \u0027been to Tesco and had their tea\u0027. Pictured above the missing poster which was put up once it had been reported that Amber was missing Asked by Ms Bower if the atmosphere was \u0027emotionally charged\u0027 and \u0027people were upset\u0027, PC Yelland replied: \u0027No, not really.\u0027She added the response at the property was \u0027just matter-of-fact\u0027 when quizzed by the coroner about how she\u0027d describe it.PC Yelland went on to tell the hearing about a comment Amber\u0027s stepfather, Danny Peat, made about her.She said: \u0027He told me her only hobby was reading and she had no real friends.\u0027The inquest heard Amber\u0027s disappearance was initially classed as \u0027medium\u0027 risk before later being upgraded to \u0027high\u0027 – although this wouldn\u0027t have made a \u0027material difference\u0027 to the response.Chief Inspector Christopher Sullivan said: \u0027It felt very much to me this was a teenager, albeit only just a teenager, who had pushed the boundaries beyond what they normally had, and although there was concern, medium risk was appropriate.\u0027Ms Bower then read a statement from Mansfield resident Adam Lamb who told how he saw a girl, thought to be Amber, at around 5.50pm on the day she went missing.He described how he and his wife were cleaning their cars when he spotted a young girl approach.Mr Lamb said: \u0027She was walking towards me. I was blocking the pavement and I began to move out of the way.\u0027She looked at me and smiled as if to say thanks. She was chewing on her left sleeve.\u0027I watched her approach the junction. She then walked across the junction and onto a green area. She then began hanging around the leafy area.\u0027I thought it was odd she was hanging around there on her own. I spoke to my wife briefly and moments later she was no longer there.\u0027 Mr Lamb added he thought the girl had \u0027walked off\u0027.He contacted police with the sighting the following day after his wife saw a news story about Amber\u0027s disappearance on Facebook.The inquest heard two officers went to the area – but they didn\u0027t speak to Mr Lamb and failed to spot Amber.Two days later Mr Lamb was visited by a detective, who asked him to show where he had last seen the girl.Detective Constable Karl Aram told the court how they \u0027stumbled across\u0027 a tiny gap in the \u0027very dense\u0027 hedgerow – and when he leant inside he immediately saw a girl\u0027s body.He added: \u0027She was facing me. It was immediately clear to me she was dead. She was completely motionless.\u0027The officer added he could sign no sign that a note had been left.

They talk with Winners Take All author Anand Giridharadas about why change is comingRutger: Winnie, why did the comments you and I made about billionaires and taxes at Davos go viral? Why do things seem to be changing right now?Winnie: Why did we go viral? I think we said things that people have wanted to hear, especially on a big stage where powerful politicians and companies are represented. And they are rarely said. People go there and speak in coded words and praise themselves and spin out the stats that suit them, but for once we spoke plainly about the challenges that people face.R: I saw some interesting stats today from Gallup that suggest that since the end of the 1990s, the vast majority of people in the US have wanted the rich to pay more taxes. There are signs that there is a profound shift in the public mood.W: I don’t know whether the left has been sleeping, but there has been a dominant narrative that has remained quite unchallenged in the media. This narrative suggests that there is no connection between the super-rich and abject poverty, that you can keep getting richer and richer, and this has nothing to do with people getting poorer. And it wasn’t always like that, people in the past have known that maximising at the top means you are depriving somebody else further down. It’s empowering for people to hear that truth being put on the table again.Anand: The idea of the narrative is so important. I think that what you both found yourselves in the middle of at Davos, and what I found myself in on my book tour over the last few months, and what politicians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have found themselves in the middle of, is the growing challenge to a kind of bullshit narrative around wealth and poverty, access and power it’s completely wrong and fraudulent, and it’s now crashing down. There is a second narrative about how the world is getting better and better: people in India and China and elsewhere have been coming out of poverty, and the world is the best it’s ever been. Never mind the fact that we’re perhaps 50 years away from catastrophic climate change fuelled by greed. That narrative, too, has had a free ride in the press and culture, including on the left, until now. And then there is a final narrative of companies and billionaires – as long as they are doing good things, we don’t ask what else they do as long as they are giving back, we don’t ask how they made their money. It’s like a mafia deal: no questions asked.R: I agree. I think that for a very long time, politicians on both the left and the right have believed that most wealth is created at the top. The brilliant entrepreneurs, the visionaries, they are the job creators. The right says we need to give them all the freedom in the world, wealth will trickle down and everything will be all right. What Winnie pointed out very well in Davos is that most real wealth is actually created at the bottom, by the working and middle classes and at the top there is a huge amount of wealth destruction and exploitation. Entrepreneurs might use the language of entrepreneurialism and hard work, but if you really delve into their business models, you’ll find that they’re not contributing to the common good. They are destroying more than they create. Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and\u0026nbspthe elaborate system of badges\u0026nbspreveals your place in the Davos hierarchy.For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all\u0026nbspa big waste of time.Who is there?More than 2,500 people – business leaders, world leaders, diplomats and the odd celebrity, such as Matt Damon – will fly in for the 49th annual Davos meeting. Most delegates are men, and although the forum boasts delegates from more than 100 countries, most hail from western\u0026nbspEurope, followed by the US. Sir David Attenborough is one of the most notable attendees in 2019, while Donald Trump, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron all pulled out at short notice to focus on more pressing issues at home.A: How did the billionaires pull this off? How is it that they conquered the realm of ideas so successfully and what do you think we need to do to win the battle of ideas in the coming years?W: I was a student in the UK when Margaret Thatcher set out to crush the unions. There was a new language at that time: the message was that if you are poor you are not working hard enough. You had to be a winner and if you were not, it was your fault. Ordinary working people were put on the defensive. But there are hardly any people now who see themselves reaching the top. The top involves a tiny number of such very rich people it’s unreal. So ordinary people are saying: “Wait a moment, we are in the majority, down here, and our lives are not like that.”R: There is a depressing finding by researchers at the LSE: in a survey of 23 western countries since the 1980s, it was discovered that, as they became more unequal, their populations actually believed more strongly that people at the top were there because they worked the hardest.A: I think in many ways the forces of plutocracy and of conservatism have been better than progressives at understanding the importance of cultivating ideas. And a big part of ideas is language. I want to give some examples of the conquest of language – words that everybody uses, not just plutocrats, but that end up doing the plutocrats’ bidding. One is “win-win”. That phrase sounds great. Who could be against win-win? But, in fact, win-win is a darkly powerful way of suggesting that the only kind of progress worth having is the kind that lets the winners win – in tandem, supposedly, with empowering others.W: Yes, we were told that globalisation was a win-win. It’s a situation where everyone is a winner and no one is a loser. In America no one even wants to say they are working class. They want to be called middle class. People feel that the right thing is to identify with the winners and that has masked many problems.A: A couple more examples. Take “thought leader”. When you were both in Davos, you were surrounded by thought leaders, who are actually people who don’t say what they truly think: they are the ones who say nice things about the powerful and keep getting invited back. Why you two made such a splash is that you refused to be thought leaders, you behaved like thinkers, which is something those people don’t expect. Another instance is “doing well by doing good”: it sounds positive but it really is about putting the people who are trying to make money in charge of changing a status quo they have no interest in changing. And then there are terms such as “social impact” and “social venture capital” and “impact investing”. They are ways of encouraging us not to use words like “power” and “justice” and “dignity”. They are an attempt to make us not speak about unions and taxes.W: I have been attending climate change negotiations since 2007 or 2008, and am always frustrated that you can not use the term “climate justice”. You can talk about “climate change”, but you cannot say it is an injustice, even though the people who are facing the worst consequences are poor people. And they are not the ones who caused it. The negotiators prefer “climate action”, and the idea that we all have to do it together, that kind of happy happy language. We don’t place the responsibility where it lies.R: I really like your point about the importance of ideas, especially on the right. People often focus on Thatcher or Ronald Reagan, but what we often forget is that this thing called neoliberalism actually started in the 1950s. Figures such as Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek gathered as part of the influential think tank the Mont Pelerin Society and, back then, these were the real radicals almost everyone else was a socialist or a social democrat. So they said to themselves we have to start developing ideas. We are the resistance now, we need to start building institutions, develop a new narrative, and wait for a moment when the current system crashes – or at least doesn’t work as well any more. This is exactly what happened during the 1970s with the oil crisis, with inflation, with strikes by workers in the west. More and more people began to think that the economic system wasn’t working. And that’s when Thatcher and Reagan came on stage with these supposedly new ideas that had in fact been developed over 30 years. When, after the financial crash of 2008, it became obvious that neoliberalism was founded on a huge amount of bullshit, the problem was that there seemed to be no alternative. The left was against a lot of things: austerity homophobia racism the establishment. But you also need to know what you are for. A few years ago I argued that we needed to have a Mont Pelerin of progressives, to start developing ideas that might seem utterly utopian now but could become a reality in the future. I didn’t expect back then to be invited to Davos, of all places, to talk about basic income, nor that I would go viral with a speech about taxes, taxes, taxes. It has been really interesting how quickly things have changed.Again, in relation to the past, there is the importance of the cold war, capitalism v communism. I’ve often thought social democrats in a way depended on there being communism further to the left. Then, with the defeat of that communism and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the “end of history” was proclaimed, and politics was just going to become technocracy – win-win. What has been happening now is that there is a new generation that’s not traumatised by the cold war. I’ve heard this in Davos as well: you talk about taxes and some of the billionaires say, “Oh that sounds like Venezuela” – Michael Bloomberg recently said it. But now there is a new generation that says: “Whatever.”A: I’ve met more people on my book tour in the last five months than I’ve ever met before in my life. And the big thing I’ve found is that the conversation no longer revolves around capitalism v gulags. When Bill Gates was asked in Davos about my book, he seemed to insinuate that I was a communist, even though he had blurbed it a year before. I think most people now understand that this “There is no alternative” talk is bullshit. An understanding seems to be rising that it’s not about left v right or communism v capitalism any more, but about humanism v plutocracy.R: One thing I’ve been doing is to use a different kind of language, one that centres on basic income for everyone and higher taxes on the rich. Often people on the left use the language of care, or they say something is just immoral or this is unjust. And yes, there is a certain part of the population that is receptive to this kind of language. But there is another part of the population that doesn’t really like that language. Also, impoverished people never like being talked down to.One thing to do is to take back the win-win language and use it for something else. For example, doing something about poverty – there’s a lot of research that shows eradicating poverty is an investment that pays for itself. You spend less on healthcare costs, you spend less on crime, kids will do better in school, so that is a win-win policy. Also, history shows the most fundamental innovation has come about through government spending. The iPhone is a perfect example: every fundamental technology that has gone through the iPhone touchscreen, the battery, the mobile technology – it has all been invented by researchers on the government payroll. In the 1980s and 90s it became fashionable to think of the government as inherently wasteful. But new research has been conducted by two Dutch economists, who asked 27,000 people in 37 countries: do you think your job is actually valuable? It turns out a quarter think their job doesn’t add anything of value. And four times as many people think that in the private sector as in the public sector. The more valuable jobs, such as caring for other people, police officers, fire fighters, you name it, are in the public sector. It’s possible to take the whole narrative of wasteful jobs and turn it around.W: Yes, at Oxfam we call it a human economy, and we try to paint a picture of what that could look like. We begin with what is wrong now, showing that the super-rich don’t just spend on priceless works of art, but also use that money to buy the public voice, buy the media, buy impunity from justice, buy the policy process, to bribe congressmen and women. I call it bribing, they call it lobbying. We show wealth at the top is being used to take away your voice, your rights, the policies that would work for you. I find that this shocks people – they start by thinking that the rich are just enjoying their money, snorting cocaine. Then they actually realise they are using that money to disempower ordinary people. For example, we can express the amount of money governments lose from billionaires’ tax dodging in terms of the number of nurses. Supposing we said: “x-billionaire dodged some 50,000 nurses”. We use that kind of language – it’s emotive, it has an impact on people.A: In the US the right has been better at using the kind of emotive language you describe. For example, the estate tax, which in any version of it only affects a very small number of estates at the top: it was brilliantly rebranded as the death tax. If you call it a death tax you create the feeling among people that their very mortality is being interfered with by the government. People who want more equality and more justice need to get more imaginative with language.R: Here’s an idea: I think we should call it a laziness tax. That’s basically what it is. You have a huge class of people who haven’t actually done any real work themselves or contributed in any meaningful way to societies. They were just born into certain families. I’ve also been trying to reframe basic income as pro-work. It’s “venture capitalism for the people”, to use a Silicon Valley phrase. Everyone wants the ability to make different choices, to move to a different city, start a new company. I dislike the left v right axis, but you often can’t get around it.A: I was listening to an extraordinary conversation Ocasio-Cortez had with the American writer Ta‑Nehisi Coates in a church a couple of weeks ago for Martin Luther King Day. Ocasio-Cortez made the point that elected officials like her are really followers rather than leaders. She said: “Part of the job of elected public office is translating public will into the law of the land. Who shapes, who directs and who moves that public will? Writers, journalists, activists, artists.” And that is so true. It was the job of Upton Sinclair to show what the slaughterhouses were actually like, and what labouring conditions were actually like, and then politicians made laws to improve things. It has been such a grim time for journalism, for books and many of these other things, in part, because of plutocrats and the monopolistic world they have built. But I come to this conversation so optimistic about the power of ideas and books right now. I feel like what we are witnessing is a profound cultural turning point in relation to these issues, caused by activists, artists and writers who are changing what the public wants by telling honest stories.W: Stories are my biggest weapon. Oxfam works in more than 90 countries around the world, and people respond to stories very strongly.R: I’m 30 years old. I’ve been writing for seven or eight years now. And never before have I had such a strong feeling that the zeitgeist is really shifting and now you can talk about things that were simply not possible just a couple of years ago. It seems like the window of what is politically possible is just opening up, or that what they call the Overton window is shifting. Ideas, according to theory that originated with political scientist Joseph Overton, are seen as somehow acceptable to discuss at a certain creative time, and the real political challenge is to move the window. The people behind such a shift are never politicians or mainstream writers, they are the radicals – those who are often seen as naive or bizarre, people who make you uncomfortable and angry. And they often pay a high price for doing this hard work. There are many examples throughout history, whether we are talking about the fight against slavery, or women fighting for the right to vote, or the establishment of the welfare state. Ideas that were first dismissed as ridiculous or too expensive or dangerous became the bedrock of civilisation. W: I hope that’s true.R: I think that hope is exactly the right word, because I never really like the word optimism. Optimism gives you the feeling that, “Oh everything will be all right, just sit down, enjoy the ride – all the trains are good.” But hope is fundamentally different, another world is possible but not inevitable.W: Do you think the racists, the misogynists, feel that they are being pushed back or do they feel they can assert themselves and make their reality the norm?A: My view from the US, and I bet it’s true in Britain to a certain extent, is that you have two big things happening to a lot of white working-class communities. On the one hand, they have been victims of a great plutocratic theft, like everybody else over the last generation. To the extent that they feel like they can’t raise children who will have a better life than them, they can’t get the kind of education that gives them a piece of the dream, they can’t have the kind of healthcare that allows them to not think about healthcare all the time, they feel that theft.The problem is that those people also feel a second theft, which is not actually a theft, which is the rise of women and minorities, and immigrants and African Americans. In fact that’s not a theft at all, it’s a wave of rising equality it is justice. But I think we have to accept that the psychological experience of this change may also be felt as a theft. What Donald Trump did is to exploit the pain caused by the real theft, and to ert blame for it on to the non-theft. He made it all about the cultural ascendancy of others – they are the ones who stole the dream from you.And instead of encouraging people to punch up at the powerful, he encouraged them to punch out, at women and minorities and the Other. I think the political challenge for us is to go to those communities and not to pander but to speak compellingly to both of those experiences of feeling wary of the future, and to identify the real reasons why it has happened. Now, before we go, I want to see if the three of us can make a case for hope. All three of us have been pushing a certain rock up a hill, and suddenly the slope seems to be becoming more hospitable. What do you want to see happen?R: If you ask people from around the globe in what kind of country they would like to live, almost everyone says: “Somewhere like Sweden.” Much less inequality, more rights for workers, higher taxes on the rich, it doesn’t really matter whether you are asking people on the left or right, it’s pretty much the same everywhere. So there is huge potential. You only need to find a way to draw on that political energy. There was one political advertisement by Bernie Sanders, in 2016, that I really like, called Together. In it he says: “We should not allow them to define us.” The whole purpose of the campaign was to bring people together – black, white, men, women, that doesn’t matter. I think this is the very simple message that we need to keep on communicating: don’t allow them to ide us.W: We must go out and mobilise and create new norms, and say, for instance, that it’s wrong for people not to have help when they are sick, they should have free healthcare. That idea was alive after the second world war. Everyone all over the world understood and agreed that healthcare should be a right. What I’m hopeful about is there is such anger at the few who are running away with wealth and power, these monopolies, these big tech companies taking our information, not paying their taxes. So much concentration of wealth and injustice by those few at the top. That is going to help us to shift the norm back to what is good for society, a human economy that works for all, a society that cares for all, including those who may not be able to work and earn. We are now a movement building. • Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World by Anand Giridharadas is published by Allen Lane.

The items are refurbished and sold in the bargain area. The idea will be tested in Glasgow and the company is considering expanding the scheme elsewhere.Hege Sæbjørnsen, sustainability manager for Ikea in the UK, said the furniture and textile schemes were a step towards creating a greener operation. The company has launched a pilot scheme in Switzerland where it leases its products, although there are no immediate plans to bring it to the UK.“We are almost in startup mode, testing business models,” Sæbjørnsen said at the launch of Ikea’s greenest store yet in Greenwich, south London.Sæbjørnsen said there was a lot of interest in learning how to fix items and developing these skills in the community was part of creating a culture around reusing and recycling.Ikea began testing textile recycling in Cardiff nearly two years ago Customers have been able to bring in old clothes, curtains or other furnishing fabrics to be repaired or cleaned and sent on to a homelessness project or recycled.Milton Keynes and Greenwich also offer the service, which will be extended to all UK stores over the next few months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ead1d6402c2c9a2f09172b58fdcb7e44dce780a/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2310d79c97a4ee229f98f394324b22bd","title":"did you work for a uk high street chain that has closed","story":"For an upcoming project, we would like to hear from former workers of chain shops that shut about how it affected their livesWith thousands of high street shops closing over the last decade, communities have been rightly concerned about the decline and what the future holds.If you worked for a high street chain that shut down, we’d like to hear from you.

It has a quote on the cover from Jen Sincero, author of You Are a Badass, and comes hard on the heels of Unf*ck Yourself F*ck Feelings F**k Anxiety Calm the F**k Down Unf*ck Your Brain How to Make Sh*t Happen and the mother of all sweary self-help titles, Mark Manson’s 2016 juggernaut The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck.Most of these books present perfectly sensible ideas about how to stop jeopardising your own efforts and escape negative thought-loops. They compile lists of bad habits and address self-defeating behaviours and a few years ago, when the trend started taking off, they sounded naughty and arresting in a light-handed way.To my ears they sound less like that now. I don’t want to be un-fun about this, but the presence in the White House of a man who, if he has mastered anything, might be said to have nailed the art of not giving a f*ck makes this and other sweary directives appear less in the vein of a cheeky marketing ploy and more like further evidence of our descent into hell.It is partly just a question of a particular formulation reaching peak usage. A few years ago, when every aspiring literary novel bore a title that married a whimsical job (lighthouse keeper) with a branch of the family tree (daughternephew), or that located a collective of obscure amateur enthusiasts (the bicycle repair shop owners’ society) somewhere western readers might find delightfully far-flung (of Tamil Nadu), a trend that once seemed mildly charming became instantly unbearable.In the realm of sweary self-help books, the book that started the avalanche was almost certainly the 2005 bestseller by Steve Lowe and Alan McArthur, Is It Just Me Or Is Everything Shit? (Or, as Bill Bryson noted in an interview with the : “Is it just this book?”) When it came out, there was some harrumphing around the language and what it said about the erosion of civility in public life, but it was generally received as a cheeky corrective to the more pompous aspects of publishing.Now, these kinds of titles simply sound angry, an extension of the shouty tone of online discourse, even if the thing they purport to be shouting down is one’s own demons. That is their appeal: demonstrating that in spite of all that bravado, everyone is running scared inside and we might all get along better if we tackled our frightened inner voices.It’s a generous interpretation of tough love, one that frames the performance of instant outrage and general fury as an expression of inadequate self-care. Love yourself more and you will be nicer to others. I’m sure this is true, but I would suggest a change of emphasis. Instead of looking purely inwards, the tough talk of these titles might address the wider implications of not giving a f*ck, while staying true to the jaunty flavour of the trend. How about a runaway hit book with broader social utility, along the lines of How to Stop Being an Arsehole?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26ca4ebb83908a430230d9ca7ed4f3ad80a672b4/0_540_3707_2224/master/3707.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c4b8320a7cc3d6a0c3b66cece815733","title":"poundland engagement ring is perfect sold 20000","story":"These days, no one can afford a ‘real’ ring, so what’s wrong about opting for a cheap ‘placeholder’?I can remember exactly where I was (a pub) when I first discovered the economics of wedding and engagement rings, I was that astonished: the groom is supposed to spend three times his monthly salary on the item. The reason it should be so expensive is that the ring has many functions a gesture of such great love it should cost more than a boiler a symbol of inidual wealth becoming irrelevant as two destinies are conjoined and a signal to the rest of the world of the scale of the catch you have just landed. But if it seemed ridiculous in the 90s, it seems even more outlandish now. Savings are so last century.Poundland recently came to the rescue with a £1 “placeholder” ring: the idea is that you choose your real ring together, but this is a myth, like “first-time buyer”. No one can afford a “real” ring, or a separate wedding ring, least of all when they have to get married. The 20,000 “bling rings” Poundland sold, in a week, will be the rings everyone says “I do” to.I got married, for the second time, less than a year ago. Without going into too much detail about how expensive getting orced is, we were skint. My Mr wanted to get a £20 wedding ring from Argos I wanted a secondhand ring for 20 times that. I won’t say it was the first time we argued, or even the first time we argued that day, but it was definitely the first time he gave me that “who even are you?” look. It is true that I do not seem like the sort of person who would make a rash decision for display purposes – unless it were, I don’t know, buying a Darth Vader suit for a dog.But I knew two things: the first is that nobody ever knows what to say to you when you’ve just got married, so they tell you you look pretty, then they ask to see your ring. I don’t think this happens to men, but it sure as hell happens to women. If you have to do that 50 times, then you will basically spend the whole of your special day talking about Argos. You’ll probably get on to the subject of its tiny pens and its awesome distribution network more than once. That’s not to say a ring doesn’t bring potential negative externalities, since it’s hard to make conversation about adornments per se. I had a friend who said, “I can never believe how cheap antique jewellery is”, then sent me an elaborate apology. At that point, I genuinely was offended that anyone would think I could be offended by someone calling my ring cheap.Second, that ring, unavoidably, becomes sentimental. When Snoop Dogg’s Beautiful is playing because you didn’t bring your own CD, when the registrar is asking you to check the certificate for errors, and you’re saying, “Yes, that’s fine, except you’ve misspelled ‘Southwark’, which is weird, as you have it embroidered on your tie”, that’s the ring you’re in. You will never replace that ring. You might buy another ring, but that will be your original ring. And if it oxidises and turns your finger a bit green, it is still your ring.This doesn’t mean a Poundland ring is a bad idea it’s brilliant. You just need to put FAQs on the invitation, with “Poundland” under “Where did you get your beautiful ring?”, so you don’t spend the day talking about the incredible value of its Halloween decorations. Also, buy seven. Because they might be cheap, but they probably won’t be built to last, even as long as the average marriage. Sentimental attachments are transferable between items, so long as they are identical."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71f36bf4f0d661b33c29da72e7229991f955021e/0_318_5208_3125/master/5208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12f26dc4bde29b17ceeaa1b1f95c71af","title":"pupils etonians inequality damian hinds","story":"It really does take a special kind of inattention to observe public life today and conclude that what we need is more public school swagger. Our politics is currently dominated by men who are so convinced of their own swag it’s dangerous. We know where politics as a debating society with no real-world consequences leads: Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson are exemplary only in their callous recklessness. Still, here we have the education secretary, Damian Hinds (I know no one knows who he is or what he does, as Brexit has vacuumed all policy into its void), suggesting that state school pupils should practise debating and public speaking to compete against Old Etonians in the workplace.“Public school confidence” is something he wants to “call time” on, so that all kinds of everyone can hold their own. Wow. This is hardly an unfamiliar idea, is it? That one can achieve privilege through class mimicry instead of, er … having actual privilege. In order to be taken seriously one must adhere to the mores of those who have effortlessly risen to the top because of their special education.Public school confidence is not some hard-won quality, it is a purchase. Confidence and contacts are the social lubricants by which iniduals signal to their own and work their way through any organisation.A public school education means smaller class sizes, good teachers and access to a world of extracurricular activities that state schools can no longer afford. Art, drama and music are now largely extracurricular thanks to the narrowing of the national curriculum. Those CV-bulking activities that signal “well-roundedness” rather than well-heeledness remain the preserve of the elite. This elite preserves itself via a segregated system while it worries earnestly about the social mobility. It is tortured, senseless stuff. What Hinds recommends, therefore, is that all schools have confidence-building activities so that pupils can build all-purpose “resilience” and “character”. I don’t know what he thinks most teachers are trying to do …All that is happening here is that attributes such as “character” inidualise lack of opportunity. You want to compete with Eton? Then you must change your personality to act like them: go rock climbing, get a Duke of Edinburgh award and go around furiously debating the hypotheticals.It goes without saying that more should be offered by state schools, but then we also need to respect and pay our burned-out teachers who are to provide all these extras. At least, I suppose, Hinds recognises that class is conveyed not simply through educational achievement but this unspoken world of social capital, cultural reference and team sports. If you don’t come from such a world, one characterised by the ease and expansiveness of public school people, often spoken about in terms of the odd notion of charm, then one is overwhelmed by one’s own sense of otherness: you don’t fit in. You are an impostor and they will sniff it out.I remember my unease being physical when I first encountered these people. I felt unclean and unequal. A working-class person should remodel herself in her master’s image? This was not an option for me. Nor is a surrender to the idea that these people just are superior, that their way of doing things is better, that loudly debating and refusing to give ground is better than listening, that reciting facts about battles is the same as thinking. Just no.One can take on the emotional labour of trying to be something you are not, or refuse it. Neither is particularly easy, but all of the escape routes have closed over the last few years. There is a huge and dull passivity around class from the Tories and policies such as Hinds’ have nothing to do with real change. They are cost-free and completely meaningless, some sort of PR for his department. One of his recent “ideas” was to help solve our dire literacy rates by getting shop assistants in Clarks or WH Smith to engage more with children. This is to support their language skills. Disadvantaged families have low literacy rates. His solution is to bring in more private companies to finance literacy projects.The link between disadvantage and literacy is serious and this tinkering at the edges is puff not policy. Again this is all about money and access. Rather we operate as a teacher said to me, like the Tour de France: a few people pull away from everyone else and the rest are all bunched up behind.Class assimilation is always the rightwing solution to inequality. It is deeply superficial. Poshness isn’t a lesson to be learned by lowly state school pupils so that they may pass as good enough because they are imbued with the confidence that “money can’t buy”. The whole point of the public school system is that money does buy it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f23972284eeb5f74da5c1c0f5d839d401041708/56_137_3942_2365/master/3942.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80984cc5e35d5d180a78dd534a338030","title":"the guardian view on the brexit talks tied to a mean minded fantasy","story":"Doggedness has sometimes served Theresa May well in the past two years. Yet, as this phase of the Brexit process reaches another crunch point, that same doggedness may now be her undoing. On Thursday the prime minister met a series of officials in Brussels. Her purpose was to try to fettle her Brexit deal in ways that the European Union can accept and Conservative MPs can vote for. The EU’s purpose was to stick to its November 2018 deal while remaining open to additional formulae that truly can get through the Commons. The talks with Jean-Claude Juncker were described as “robust and constructive”. This was predictable, since both sides need to show that they are sticking to their opening positions while at the same time looking for agreement. There will be more talks in the coming days. But the reality is that this approach is running out of road.The moral and political bankruptcy of this approach was apparent from Thursday’s joint statement. It made clear – just as it has been clear from the EU side ever since November – that significant changes to the withdrawal agreement are simply not on the table. The EU27 will not reopen the agreement, Mr Juncker said flatly. Mrs May’s hope, therefore, is to extract some form of commitment on exiting the Northern Ireland backstop, alongside the existing text, that will persuade enough of the 118 Tories who voted against her last month to change their minds. This looks likely, if it happens at all, to take the form of some kind of legally binding version of the letters that Donald Tusk and Mr Juncker published in January.For some rebel Tory MPs this may suffice as a way of implementing the so-called Brady amendment for which they overwhelmingly voted last week. For others in the rightwing European Research Group, however, it would simply sound the death knell of this phase, since they are dedicated to removing the backstop altogether. That isn’t going to happen, because the EU27 will not shift on it. Mrs May admitted this reality in Belfast on Tuesday. She repeated it in meetings with MEPs in Brussels on Thursday. The 27 are not looking for a compromise to the agreement. They are dealing with a country that is leaving their union. They mistrusted Mrs May’s embrace of the Brady amendment right from the start. They still do. The bottom line is that her prospects of getting the “substantial and sustainable” majority she needs if she is to get any deal through the Commons based on Tory and DUP votes alone are still vanishingly small. This makes the danger of a no-deal outcome much greater.The effect of Mr Corbyn’s letter may in fact be to strengthen Mrs May’s attempt to chisel out a tweaked version of her original deal. Her aim is still to persuade her rebels that her tweaked deal is the least bad of all the options, ranging from no deal through to a soft Brexit and a second vote. Her approach is what it has always been, a mean-minded attempt to tie Britain to a departure from the EU that contains no meaningful guarantees for jobs, the economy, future generations and their place in the world. The millions who want Britain to be close to Europe, and who might have been persuaded to accept a serious soft-Brexit option, are being sacrificed on the altar of a fraudulent, short-term political fix to keep the Tory party factions together on the night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50e15c108cc52b39862450c9d1f8addd653e0bfb/0_692_2912_1747/master/2912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd2ecb11aa65b3b9688302499054f42a","title":"womens aid ceo ukip katie ghose","story":"The fact that Katie Ghose led the charity at all shows that the corporatisation of the women’s sector has gone too farIn early January, I was due to speak at the opening of an exhibition about the domestic violence refuges of the 1970s and 1980s. Out of curiosity, I Googled the woman who was to speak alongside me: Katie Ghose, at the time the CEO of Women’s Aid. What I discovered astounded me.In 2015, two years before she joined Women’s Aid, she had, as CEO of the Electoral Reform Society (ERS), spoken at the Ukip annual conference and enthused about the party’s “passion for a new way of doing politics”, referring to Douglas Carswell as “an outstanding MP” and praising Nigel Farage. At a fringe event organised by ERS at the Ukip conference, she had hosted Katie Hopkins, who had ranted about gassing members of the House of Lords.Utterly dismayed, I refused to share a platform with her. Since then, the London Black Women’s Project (LBWP), who co-organised the exhibition, has sent three emails to Women’s Aid, demanding an explanation and stating that Ghose’s position as CEO of Women’s Aid is “untenable”. On Thursday the silence from Women’s Aid was finally broken by the news that Ghose is leaving the organisation by “mutual consent”.When in 1979, a group of us set up the first refuge run by and for Asian women in London, we were simply trying to solve the problems we had identified as feminist community activists. We saw separate refuges as essential because traumatised Asian women and children fleeing violence needed safe spaces free of racism where our cultures were understood. Our politics as anti-racist feminists ensured that discussions about women’s oppression and how to manage in a racist society were held in the refuge. Soon, other similar refuges sprang up elsewhere in the UK – poorly funded, perhaps, but committed to feminist and anti-racist principles.The first major changes came with Thatcherism. Funding organisations began to demand business models and targets based on a market-oriented philosophy and language. In a Kafkaesque development, which the sector has now come to accept as normal, the time spent helping women and children escape violence, and supporting them in traumatic times, had to be assessed in terms of “value for money”.It was the beginning of the corporatisation of the women’s sector and the establishment of strict hierarchies led by celebrity CEOs. Today, Women’s Aid, for example, has three directorates, each with its own director, under a CEO who is paid a cool £80-85,000, while some workers in its member organisations outside of London get around £18,000.As in the corporate world, refuges and women’s centres have to compete for funds, and spend an inordinate amount of time writing bids. In this process the importance of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) specialist services is not acknowledged, and these are often forced to close down or merge with generic organisations. So while the dominant image of the oppressed Muslim woman being saved by the white knight of the British state is constantly recycled, organisations such as Apna Haq in Rotherham, with an established record of providing crucial support to Muslim women, lose funding to generic organisations.Meanwhile, privatisation is rampant with, for example, multinational security services company G4S (which was filmed assaulting and mocking detainees at a detention centre it runs) taking over sexual assault referral centres.All this is happening against a background where a new domestic violence bill, similar to US laws on domestic violence, is being brought in. Its focus is almost entirely on locking people up – and as experiences in the US show, those incarcerated are sometimes not only the perpetrator but the survivor as well.With Ghose’s departure, Women’s Aid should take the opportunity to acknowledge not only its abysmal failure in the context of recruitment, but its other deep-rooted problems. Organisations such as Amnesty, recently exposed for bullying, should make all large NGOs think again about issues such as wage hierarchies and power structures. As for feminism, Women’s Aid needs to remember what it stands for and that black women’s organisations in the sector will not allow issues of race to be brushed under the carpet.• Amrit Wilson is a writer and activist on issues of race and gender in Britain and south Asian politics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d02349b56164d6bc1df660cf71aa29a3746f4c02/0_0_7520_4514/master/7520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c08af978edd5c5dd6c23abffdb28aff","title":"rising trend of state school pupils going to university reverses","story":"For universities it marked the first reversal in the rise of state school enrolments since 2010-11, matching other data showing only slow progress being made in recruiting students from areas of low educational attainment.The fall in state school students came despite a rapid expansion of the higher education sector and an emphasis on widening participation and access programmes by universities at the encouragement of regulators.Luke Heselwood, a researcher at the Reform thinktank who has studied disadvantaged participation, said: “If ministers want to do better, they should do three things: find a better measure for assessing disadvantage, evaluate universities’ spending on widening participation, and campaign to encourage applications from disadvantaged students.”Heselwood said the current measures used to assess disadvantage were not effective and argues that it would be better to use measures such as free school meals rates instead.Chris Millward, the director for fair access and participation at the Office for Students (OfS), the university regulator for England, called the improvements incremental and promised that the OfS’s plans would lead to a step change within the next five years.“We want universities to understand how they are performing using sophisticated measures, looking across different characteristics to understand disadvantage in their own context and targeting their activity and investment so that it really works,” Millward said.Also at the bottom of the table was a group of small, specialist institutions such as the Royal College of Music and the Courtauld Institute of Art."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dac3c31ed836093bb6e1bfbe45ece22d7d1464b/0_1050_3955_2373/master/3955.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c92039ee9dcf82962dafbfbe7da38a91","title":"scientists find some fish can recognise themselves in mirror","story":"Wrasse passes intelligence test in disputed study, challenging ‘vacant’ reputation of fishThey are often said to have a three-second memory, but the brain power of fish has been considerably underestimated, according to scientists who found some fish can recognise themselves in the mirror.Their findings suggest that a small, otherwise unremarkable species called the cleaner wrasse has joined an elite handful of others to have passed the so-called mirror test, which has been used for decades as a gold standard measure of animal intelligence.Passing the test is widely viewed as an indication of self-awareness and until now the only animals to have crossed this threshold are great apes, bottlenose dolphins, killer whales, Eurasian magpies and a single Asian elephant. Now the select club may have an unlikely new member.“These fish are fascinating in their breadth of cognitive abilities – and underappreciated,” said Alex Jordan, an evolutionary biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany and the study’s senior author. He and colleagues are calling for an overhaul of the traditional hierarchy of animal intelligence, saying that despite their reputation for being “basically vacant”, fish perform exceptionally well on certain tasks.The prospect of fish rising up the ranks of animal cognition has not been universally welcomed though, and the paper proved so controversial it took the authors five years to get it published. “Some areas of the academic community seem fairly intent on fish not joining the pantheon of smart things because then their own animals lose their special place in the world,” said Jordan.The cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus) is about 10cm long with a stripe, and lives in coral reefs. Previous research has revealed these fish have complex social lives, forming allegiances and enemies, making logical inferences about whether they will beat other fish in fights and showing a capacity for deception. The fish live in mutually beneficial partnerships with larger client fish from whom they feed on dead skin and parasites.During the mirror test, the researchers placed a mark on the fish in a location that could only be seen in a mirror reflection. Initially, the fish reacted aggressively and repeatedly tried to bite their reflections. But over the next few days, they stopped biting and started “behaving weirdly” in front of the mirror, swimming upside down, for instance, or doing repeated bursts of acceleration past the mirror.According to the authors, the fish were “contingency testing” – doing strange things to see whether the reflection did the same as a way of figuring out the function of the mirror. They were also observed attempting to remove the marks by scraping their body on hard surfaces after viewing themselves in the mirror. These activities were not seen when the fish were given marks without a mirror present or when they interacted with marked fish across a clear ider.“It’s not that this proves fish are as smart as chimpanzees,” said Jordan. “It shows that in this task the fish can perform in a similar way. They can understand what the mirror does and use the mirror to see its own body.”He added it did not necessarily imply fish were self-aware, but the findings challenged the idea that animal intelligence follows a continuum, with chimpanzees at the top and fish, insects and reptiles at the bottom.Prof Gordon Gallup, a psychologist at the University at Albany in New York, who pioneered the mirror test in 1970, disputed whether the fish really recognised themselves.He said in their “zeal to undermine the integrity” of the gold standard test the authors may have overlooked other explanations. The behaviour could be explained because the fish were evolutionarily programmed to be interested in skin markings, Gallup suggested. “There is a distinct possibility that these findings may be an artefact of using marks that simulate ectoparasites,” he said.Jordan said some of the criticisms were prompted by people’s preconceptions about fish, rather than scientific objectivity, which he said was “a bit sad and disappointing”.“When it’s a fucking elephant and one of two elephants passes the test, everyone’s like ‘Yeah cool’,” said Jordan. “When it’s a fish they’re like, ‘Ooh you need a conspecific control and a control for empathy and a control for this and that … the fish are not doing this’.”The authors said the findings raised questions about fish welfare. “We must be very careful as scientists and humans not to let our loss of empathy towards animals that look different to us influence our opinion of what they experience,” said Jordan.“Otherwise, we conveniently forget or ignore that fish and other animals are sentient and, for instance, our entire practice of commercial fishing lets these animals die in stress and pain on the decks of boats.”The findings are published in the journal PLOS Biology."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a617c78c096c4884eb21f067e0860fd40a7521c4/0_374_1242_745/master/1242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66db1d266c5a7e242260e73f5f9d966a","title":"gucci withdraws jumper blackface balaclava","story":"Italian fashion house lambasted over ‘balaclava’ polo neck with large red lipsGucci has withdrawn a polo neck jumper from its shops after social media users said it resembled blackface.The $890 (£689) “balaclava” knit, part of the autumnwinter 2018 collection, covers the bottom half of the face and has a cutout mouth with large red lips.On Wednesday, Twitter and Instagram users posted pictures of the jumper, with several pointing to the fact it was currently Black History Month in the US.One person tweeted: “Balaclava knit top by Gucci.

At first glance, a black man is the first to die. The twist, we find out later on, if that at least part of him survives.One of the surprises of Horror Noire, a new documentary examining how black characters fare in horror cinema, is that the cliche Jordan Peele subverts in his Oscar-winning commercial smash is not as common as we believe. In a decade-ning documentary, director Xavier Burgin upends a number of myths in a project that owes an inevitable debt to the 2017 hit.“Get Out was a game changer for so many of us,” says Tananarive Due, a horror writer, academic and executive producer. “People didn’t understand that black horror was a thing. It wasn’t the first black-themed horror film, but it started a conversation about the history of blacks in horror cinema.”Yet some of the examples that the academics and actors bring up are far less expected. The observation that King Kong is a metaphor for the black experience is such a common one that it can be found in everything from Academy Award-winning monologues to magazine covers, yet racial overtones could also be found in other major studio horrors in the years that followed. Coleman critiques the particular racialized appearance of 1954’s The Creature from the Black Lagoon the physicality of monsters like the titular creature could be compared to the way “black facial features were misrepresented and caricatured back in the 40s”, says Due.The 1960s saw a notable exception with George Romero’s Night of the Living Dead. Black filmgoers finally experienced a protagonist who is not only black but is also able to fight those who would oppress him: white zombies. Troubling ambiguities remained, however. For example, according to Peele: “You can never quite tell if the white woman who Duane Jones is essentially saving is more creeped out by the fact that there are zombies outside, or that there is a black man inside the house.” White fear seems almost an obstacle to black protection. This radical message impressed Due.“They are shooting this film in 1967, so I have to believe that George Romero, who must have been progressive-minded to even consider Duane Jones for the part, had to see through this lens what these images were,” she says. “It must have been a shock for viewers in 1968.”Blaxploitation was treated with ambivalence – the films brought more black faces to the screen, yet continued to prop up certain stereotypes about black men and black women. “Black characters were put in these boxes, and the roles were so stereotypical,” Due says. “However, to see Blacula stand up to the police to was empowering. What blaxploitation gave us was visibility, the blaxploitation films were for us, and sometimes, they were by us.”Blacula is praised for allowing black characters to discuss matters of state and morality and anti-racism and its director, William Cain, insisted that dancing be integrated with interracial couples on the floor.By the 1980s, black characters were mainly cast as the sidekicks of white leads. One prominent example is Scatman Crothers, who appears in The Shining as a mystical black man who provides information and protection to a white family his existence or non-existence seems contingent on what he can do for them, and he is promptly killed once he is considered non-essential. Due makes the point that the character Crothers played does not die in the book, and the film makes him into a “sacrificial negro”. This character, according to writer Ashlee Blackwell, “must put themselves in the face of danger and must die in order to help the white character to survive”.The ensuing decades are portrayed as a more positive era in black horror film-making – even though similar stereotypes still remain. Burgin provided a contemporaneous example of the sacrifical negro with a reference to Lil Rel Howery’s character in Bird Box. “A black man sacrifices himself for the white women and two kids,” he says. “In 2018, we are still seeing some of the same tropes that we are talking about in the film.”Bernard Rose’s Candyman, Rusty Cundieff’s Tales From the Hood, Wes Craven’s People Under the Stairs, Kasi Lemmons’ Eve’s Bayou and, of course, Jordan Peele’s Get Out are provided as examples of progress. Cundieff and Craven are praised for not only providing roles for black protagonists, but also for commenting on the dual horrors of police brutality and suburban racism as discriminatory societal forces. Get Out reckons with the complicated legacy of the Obama era when people routinely proffered the idea that America was post-race. Eve’s Bayou, though not considered a typical horror film per se, contains fearful elements of America’s history and was a rare film directed by a black woman.By showing a visual history of black characters in cinema and on television – including clips from the civil rights movement and Rodney King’s beating – the film makes it clear how far is yet to go. If it seems there are now roles and positions for black artists in the film industry, then this film shows how recent these developments are. One of the more recent examples, Boots Riley’s Sorry To Bother You, though promoted as a comedy, hints at the past and present horror of experimentation and exploitation on black workers. “The beautiful thing about horror is that it is an emotion as much as a genre,” Due says. “It is horror on a work-day level, and it is horror on the level of body horror.”Perhaps, now that these opportunities exist, viewers should expect more films that utilize genre to examine a society that has excluded and caricatured them. Films such as last year’s The First Purge, directed by Gerard McMurray, had room for comment on the inequalities of contemporary American life along with a chance for black characters to seek retribution. Horror projects by Dee Rees and Justin Simien are in the works Jordan Peele’s Us has already provoked wild anticipation and speculation. These new voices creating subversive work confirm Burgin’s assertion that to see representations in horror that go against the dominant narrative, opportunities need to be provided. “There is no genre that a black person can’t do and isn’t interested in doing,” he says. “It’s just getting the chance to do it in the first place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d34da9b8d64ecee2a9e651d762e5291a323b7592/0_93_4920_2952/master/4920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5d87447e38474d9b5d3301ce07d2159","title":"juliette binoche harvey weinstein has had enough","story":"The actor has said she wishes ‘peace’ to the disgraced mogul’s ‘mind and heart’ and that the time has come for ‘justice to do its work’The actor Juliette Binoche has called for an end to the public excoriation of Harvey Weinstein and said that the cases should now be left to the courts.Speaking at the opening press conference for the Berlin film festival, where she is heading the jury, Binoche said that she had encountered no problems in her long relationship with the producer, who has been accused of multiple counts of sexual assault. He denies all incidents of non-consensual sex.“I almost want to say peace to his mind and heart, that’s all,” said Binoche. “I’m trying to put my feet in his shoes. He’s had enough, I think. A lot of people have expressed themselves. Now justice has to do its work.“I never had problems with him, but I could see that he had problems. As a producer he was wonderful, most of the time.

Or the grim story of the ex-husband she married … twice? Hollywood’s most unfiltered actor spills allTiffany Haddish: comedian, actor and, by some measure, the US’s most enjoyable celebrity, has a helluva story to tell. One that involves a stepfather confessing he tried to kill her a mother with schizophrenia an abusive ex-husband whom she married twice, and, well, that’s barely skimming the surface. But ever since her breakout role in the 2017 hit comedy Girls Trip, she has had different kinds of stories to tell. And, oh boy, is she good at telling them.“So I shouldn’t tell this, but … When I arrived in London, I was staying at Salma Hayek’s house – she’s my friend now,” she says, with a grin that is half self-mocking for the name-drop and half endearingly excited. “And I get there and her house is like a PALACE. And she says: ‘OK, pick a room.’ And I’m, like: ‘First off, the fact that you tell me to pick a room is, like, AMAZING.’ Then she shows me her closet and it is the most amazing thing in the world, Gucci, whatever, EVERYTHING. And I’m, like: ‘I’ll sleep in here!’ Then she shows me her daughter’s old bedroom with pink walls, circle bed, unicorn stuff all around. And I’m, like: ‘I’m sleeping in here! I always wanted to be a princess, and this is a princess room!’”By now, Haddish, 39, is so excited she is banging the sofa she is sitting on with her fists, a seven-year-old overcome in a toy store: “I mean, AMAZING!”Haddish and I are meeting in a hotel in London, ostensibly to discuss her work in The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part. When the first Lego film came out in 2014, she was a little-known comedian who had spent the past decade hacking her way through small TV appearances (typical IMDb entry: “One episode of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, stripper number three.”) Now, just four years later, she is one of the main characters in the mega-earning franchise, appearing alongside Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks and Will Ferrell and, as is Haddish’s way, nearly stealing the film from all of them.She is extremely funny as the shape-shifting blocks called Queen Watevra Wa’Nabi (as in, “whatever I wanna be”), and the movie is a joy – but it’s clear pretty quickly that Haddish doesn’t have much interest in discussing it. (Me: “What did you think when you saw what your character looked like?” Her: “Never thought I’d play someone with blue eyes, but hey.”)Haddish got her first break in 2015 on Tyler Perry’s soapy drama, If Loving You Is Easy, followed by a regular gig on the NBC sitcom, The Carmichael Show. When she finally shot to fame at 37 in Girls Trip, the riotous and raunchy film about four female friends, critics rightly compared her clearly star-making performance to that of Zach Galifianakis in The Hangover and Melissa McCarthy in Bridesmaids. While the three other women were perfectly good, Haddish had so much vibrant charisma, she made the others look pale in comparison.Since then, she has won an Emmy for hosting Saturday Night Live is the star of The Last OG, a US comedy created by Jordan Peele and co-starring Tracy Morgan and this year alone has four movies coming out. But alongside her comedy, Haddish has become almost as well known for her appearances on the US talkshow circuit, where she describes her adventures among the A-listers with a candour you never hear from celebrities.Last summer on Jimmy Kimmel, she described the time she went up to Leonardo DiCaprio at a Beverly Hills party and told him: “So, I want to hit that – but I only want to do it to you as your character out of What’s Eating Gilbert Grape.” (DiCaprio played a mentally disabled teenager in the 1994 film.) DiCaprio – understandably – thought this was a joke and launched into the usual actor spiel about how he had prepared for the role, and what a great experience the film was. “And I was like: ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah,’” Haddish says making a bored face. “‘But when am I gonna hit that?’”Has she hit that?“No – he never called me! He don’t want me!” she says collapsing on the sofa with an exaggerated sob. She is groomed like a Hollywood starlet for the day – hair straight, gown formal – but throws herself around like a slapstick comedian. “I better leave him alone before he says I #MeToo-ed him through the press, and I don’t harass him because I know he’s got a girlfriend. But when that relationship goes, I’m popping back up, like: ‘Hi, Leonardo!’”I tell her that it’s so much fun to hear what it’s like on the inside of celebrity from someone who clearly still feels like they’re on the outside.“I definitely, totally, feel like I’m on the outside. I mean, where I came from is definitely on the outside, and that’s what made me who I am,” she says.It would hard to be more on the outside than where Haddish started. She was born and raised in one of the poorest neighbourhoods in South Central Los Angeles, and her Eritrean father left when she was three. When she was eight, her mother was in a car accident so serious it gave her brain damage and probably triggered her schizophrenia. Haddish suddenly had to look after her four half-siblings as well as her mother, who, when she got out of hospital, would regularly beat her and tell her that she hated her because she reminded her of Haddish’s father.When Haddish was 12, her mother got into a vicious fight with a neighbour and accidentally whacked his baby with a plank of wood. The baby was fine, but once social services cottoned on to just how chaotic Haddish’s home life was, they intervened. Haddish was placed in a group home, where she was viciously bullied, then in a foster home where the grandfather would suck on her nipples, telling her it would make her breasts grow faster.At what point did she realise she was being molested?“Not until years later! Yeah,” she says with a shrug that seems more like an expression of closure and self-protection than lack of interest.Eventually, Haddish’s grandmother got custody of the kids, and Haddish went to school, where she managed to hide the fact that she was illiterate until she was 14. A few years later, Haddish’s stepfather told her that he had cut the brakes in Haddish’s mother’s car when she’d had her car accident, in the hope of killing her and all the children.“I’m supposed to be a millionaire and y’all supposed to be gone,” he said, according to her extraordinary memoir, The Last Black Unicorn.Is she in touch with her stepfather now?“Yeah, yeah, I just saw him this weekend in Vegas. He came to my show,” she says.How does it feel to see a man who confessed to trying to kill her?“Well, at least he confessed,” she says. But when she sees the expression on my face, she continues: “And, you know, I can’t PROVE he did it. Maybe he was just saying it.”“Maybe to make me work harder or to appreciate life or … or … I don’t know. But I don’t hate him. You know, he fought in the Vietnam war, he was a sniper – he’s got his own little demons. God makes you pay for your sins, and if I hadn’t gone through that, where would I be now?”When Haddish was 15 and back with her grandmother, she became so disruptive in school that her social worker gave her an ultimatum: psychiatric therapy or comedy camp. Haddish chose comedy camp, and, she says simply: “It changed my life.” One of the most heartbreaking parts of reading Haddish’s memoir, I tell her, is thinking of how many other kids – in LA, the US, anywhere – had similarly chaotic beginnings, and knowing she is the exception to getting beyond them. “Totally. I mean, I still live in South Central because it’s where I’m comfortable. But I know I’m blessed,” she says.After finishing high school and getting kicked out by her grandmother, she gave up her tentative dreams of comedy and took various jobs, ranging from working in an airport to being, briefly, a pimp. Eventually, she decided to return to comedy. But she was regularly sexually harassed by comedy club owners – “They’d say: ‘So you want this, you’re gonna have to do that,” – and Haddish always refused. She was so broke that, for a while, she lived in her car. When her comedy colleague Kevin Hart heard, he gave her $300 for a hotel room for a week. Haddish, characteristically and correctly, shot back: “What? I cannot get no hotel room nowhere for 300 bucks.”The two are still good friends, and regularly work together. Haddish is loyal to him when asked about the recent furore around Hart’s homophobic tweets, which led to him stepping down from hosting this year’s Oscars.“First of all, he apologised for what he did years ago,” she begins, which is a somewhat debatable claim. But her second point is undoubtedly true: “So he was like: ‘Oh you guys don’t want it? OK bye.’ And he went to Australia and did a show for 35,000 people, and I think he made more money doing a comedy show than doing the Oscars.”Haddish is always conscious of money. When we meet, she is wearing a beautiful long green Gucci dress (sweetly, she has left the side zip down) and shoes, which she admires lovingly. “It’s nice being able to buy things now, but I still count every penny,” she says.The first thing she did when she started earning was get her mother proper medical care. Haddish’s grandmother and youngest brother live with her while Haddish is redoing her grandmother’s house.So does she support her whole family? “We support each other,” she says firmly. “Maybe I contribute a little more financially because I’m gone a lot now, and that makes me feel bad. But I’m looking forward to having my house back to myself so I can walk around naked. Ha ha!”Haddish is single, and has had, she admits, poor judgment when it comes to men. To make a very long story short, she met her now ex-husband on a cruise, he tracked her down five years later in 2011, and wooed her by finding her father, whom she hadn’t seen since she was three. Pretty much from the beginning, she says, he found him controlling. And yet, despite not even being attracted to him, she married him.“I’m thinking: this is God’s work, and even if he’s not that physically attractive, I can live with that. What’s important is his soul, and to me, it seemed his soul cared about me a lot,” she writes in her memoir.She has also made allegations of physical violence in her autobiography, which he has denied he has also filed a $1m libel suit against her publisher. She finally orced him – and then, two years later, remarried him. She orced him for a second time in 2013 and is the one subject on which she will not be drawn.“Girl, I don’t deal with that man. I wish him well, and stay out of my life, please,” is all she’ll say when asked about him.She jokes about how she is looking for her fantasy man (“He gotta know how to cook, dance, be psychic …”) But Haddish has generally looked for men who need saving, and, given her family history, it’s not that surprising. Probably the most poignant part of her memoir comes when, as an adult, Haddish tries to involve her biological father in her life. But he abandons her again, and she is devastated.Today, she says she doesn’t really want kids, and initially I assume it’s because of her career ambitions and, yes, she says, it is a bit of that. (“If Meryl Streep can be invited to the Oscars 22 times, why can’t I?”) But she is also scared of repeating her mother’s patterns: “My mama would say to me: ‘You look like your ugly daddy.’ I would hate to hear that come out of my mouth, but who’s to say it wouldn’t? I never want to put that on someone else,” she says. “But if some man inspires me to bust this thing open that’s cool, too!”My favourite Haddish moment is not from her comedy and movies, but when she appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres Show last year, where, to her astonishment, Oprah Winfrey surprised her on stage.Haddish went in full meltdown, alternately sobbing that she loved her and furiously asking why Winfrey never replied to her letters.“I lost the letter,” Winfrey replied, in a tone that suggests she gets asked that a lot.“But I wrote you six!” wept Haddish on national TV.I tell Haddish I’d never seen a celebrity seem so human on a talkshow, or interview one so open about herself either.“For me, being fake is too exhausting,” she says. “I think the way I grew up, in different homes, different schools, taught me I’m most comfortable being myself wherever I am. Also, I think being fake shows on people – they get tired, or bitter. Being yourself is easiest. I may be cheating but you know what? It feels good!”The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part opens on 8 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1595e7665f2c489547543bda016872f12c0f3580/1504_309_1174_704/master/1174.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b77ecbb634f67e7219c4257456428a7d","title":"woody allen launches 68m legal action against amazon","story":"Director sues studio after his latest film, A Rainy Day in New York, is shelved following renewal of abuse allegation, which he deniesWoody Allen has launched a $68m legal action against Amazon, alleging the studio has broken a four-film deal the director signed with the tech giant in 2016.Allen’s most recent film, A Rainy Day in New York, appeared to have been indefinitely shelved by Amazon despite the company being contractually obliged to release it, according to the film-maker. This followed the re-emergence of a sex-abuse allegation against the director by his daughter Dylan Farrow. Allen has always denied the claim. Authorities investigated but no evidence was found and the case was not pursued.Allen’s filing in New York federal court states: “Amazon has tried to excuse its action by referencing a 25-year-old, baseless allegation against Mr Allen, but that allegation was already well known to Amazon (and the public) before Amazon entered into four separate deals with Mr Allen – and, in any event it does not provide a basis for Amazon to terminate the contract … There simply was no legitimate ground for Amazon to renege on its promises.”Allen also says he is owed $9m (£7m) by Amazon after financing the production of A Rainy Day in New York himself, and that Amazon committed to releasing the film for a minimum of 90 days. The complaint also says that Amazon attempted to terminate their agreements in June 2018 with no “legal or factual basis”.Amazon first signed Allen in 2015 to make a TV series, signalling its intention to become a major player in the streaming sector. This project became the roundly criticised Crisis in Six Scenes. His 2017 feature film Wonder Wheel, starring Kate Winslet and Justin Timberlake, was also produced by the studio. Allen then entered into a four-film contract with it, of which A Rainy Day in New York was the first, originally intended for release in 2018.However, A Rainy Day in New York, which features Timothée Chalamet, Elle Fanning and Jude Law, became engulfed in controversy after an article by Farrow titled “Why has the #MeToo revolution spared Woody Allen?” appeared in the LA Times in October 2017. A number of Allen collaborators, including Chalamet, Rebecca Hall, Greta Gerwig and Colin Firth publicly disassociated themselves from the director. Chalamet donated his salary to charity, saying: “I don’t want to profit from my work on the film.”However, Allen was defended by actors Javier Bardem and Jude Law, with the latter referring to the non-appearance of A Rainy Day in New York as “a terrible shame”.Amazon Studios has not responded to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

It is from John:14:6 and declares: “I am the way, the truth, the life,” but it would be a mistake to imagine that Newcastle United’s new £21m signing is a model of piety.When Almirón was quizzed about its relevance to his life on Wednesday the Paraguay playmaker’s answer revealed the sort of refreshing humour and humility that will surely serve the 24-year-old well as he follows in the footsteps of the club’s former record buys Michael Owen and Alan Shearer.“I’m not an angel,” said Atlanta’s former star player with a smile as he showed off that wrist at his “unveiling” in front of the north‑east media. “Though I do try to go to church every so often to put right my sins.”There was another broad grin when he was subsequently asked if a sensational YouTube compilation of what appears his greatest on field hits reflected reality. “My best friend made it,” he quipped. “You’ll only see if that was true when you see me play. I try not to get to get carried away or go too crazy about what people write on social media, it’s about trying to do my best. I don’t for one minute consider myself to be an idol or a hero.“Football’s not just about skill and ability, and especially in this league when the tempo is so high, it’s about working hard. To succeed you’ve got to put a shift in.”It is no exaggeration to say his move to the US two years ago proved life-changing. “I’m from a humble background,” he said, speaking through a Spanish interpreter. “My parents always worked really hard to make sure we had food on the table. My dad was a security guard and my mum worked in a supermarket but now, because I’ve done OK, they’ve been able to retire.”For the moment Almirón is domiciled in a hotel room with a prime view of the Tyne Bridge but he is already househunting and expects his parents to join him and his partner in Newcastle. Such emotional support will be welcome because, as the Premier League’s most expensive January signing, he is braced to be singled out.“I don’t pay too much attention to my price tag or the pressure,” he says. “My focus is to learn from the manager and my teammates. I’m aware it’s a physical league but every player who comes to the Premier League comes with a dream to achieve something big and it’s similar with me. I want to work really hard to bring something to this team, to add quality.“First and foremost I see being the new record signing as an honour. Playing in front of 52,000 people at St James’ Park will be magnificent.”Newcastle fans hope Almirón’s arrival can simultaneously persuade Rafael Benítez to extend his contract beyond May – the new boy said he and his manager have not discussed this topic - ensure relegation is avoided and, eventually, help the team lift their first trophy since 1969.After completing visa and work permit formalities Almirón hopes to make his Premier League debut at Wolves on Monday night. “I feel good physically, I’m in good shape. Our pre-season had started at Atlanta so I’ve got some physical work done it’s about integrating with my new teammates and settling in as quickly as possible.”“I’m the sort of player who likes to get my teammates playing around me,” he added before stressing an appreciation of the scale of the challenge ahead.“Newcastle United has so much history around it and that’s a form of pressure in itself,” said the eighth Paraguayan to play in England’s top tier. “We know what the fans demand of us but it’s always been my dream to come to Europe and play in the Premier League. I feel I’m representing my country but I also know it’s going to be quite tough to adapt.“There are quite big differences between the MLS and the Premier League. The tempo here is different, it’s higher, with more pressing. It’s a more difficult league but, with the help of my teammates, it’s something I feel I’ll cope with – and my manager will help me.“When I heard about the interest from Rafa Benítez I had no hesitation about wanting to play for him. We all know what a great manager he is, what a great person he is. Coming here was a no-brainer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/902d87414432aac57b32283cf31bb58d67e93597/0_312_4842_2905/master/4842.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b71fe9d865f6e59b50c7f239d89090cd","title":"the premier league title race and savehakeem football weekly extra podcast","story":"Max Rushden, Philippe Auclair, Andy Brassell and Reshmin Chowdhury discuss the Premier League title race, cup games big, small, muddy and messy, and talk to Craig Foster on Hakeem al-AraibiJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Now we will see what kind of psychological impact Liverpool feel from seeing themselves in second after missing the chance to go seven points clear only last week. How quickly things can change in football.Liverpool did enjoy a seven-point lead after they beat Crystal Palace less than three weeks ago. Now they’re behind City on goal difference. It’s like a middle-distance race in which the leader is suddenly caught, with the final straight in sight. Will they slide away, or will they be able to go again? Surely another slip would give their rivals momentum and further destroy their own.After the West Ham game on Monday night Andy Robertson snapped at an interviewer who asked if the team had started to feel nervous, looking over their shoulders at City. Robertson gave a strong answer and denied any nerves but it was a deflection from reality: those back-to-back 1-1 draws against Leicester and the Hammers were an answer in themselves. Something may be shifting psychologically in that Liverpool team, and it’s affecting their performances and costing them points at a very crucial stage in the season.You could see there was anger as Robertson spoke. He was clearly annoyed they had put themselves in this position. As much as players and managers say they’re focusing on themselves and taking it one game at a time, I can guarantee as soon as the players got back in the dressing room on Monday they were thinking: “That’s it, City go top on Wednesday.” You immediately think of your closest rival.It could go two ways from here. Sometimes it’s easier to chase a title than it is to lead. It can be more problematic to be the pacemakers, as Liverpool have shown over the past fortnight. I’ve experienced it with Chelsea Women: it can be very hard at the top for long periods of time, fighting just to stay in the same position and to preserve an unbeaten run that will always come to an end. Liverpool still have the destiny of the title in their own hands, having played a game fewer than the leaders, and their recent wobble and City’s return to the top may be the kick up the backside they required, forcing them to regroup, refocus and make sure they push on and win the league. Equally City will be saying: “We led before and gave it away – let’s not do that again.”What a contrast this is to the same time a year ago, when City were 13 points clear after 26 games and their name was practically engraved on the trophy. As title chases go it was a complete non-event, just boring. Now it’s neck and neck, apparently heading for a photo finish.Liverpool need to be strong psychologically, because they are clearly inferior to City in other areas. Their squad has nothing like the strength of City’s. With Joe Gomez, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dejan Lovren injured, their previously rock-solid defence is creaking. Michail Antonio’s goal for West Ham resulted from an unusually high and disorganised Liverpool backline that on another occasion in the game allowed Declan Rice a free header that should have made it 2-1.James Milner is a great professional but as a makeshift right-back he isn’t the outlet that Alexander-Arnold is, and Virgil van Dijk is having a fantastic season but the other centre-backs are not on the same level. At the end of 2018 Liverpool had let in eight goals in 20 league games in 2019 they’ve conceded seven in five matches and also been knocked out of the FA Cup by Wolves.However, all hope is not lost. Jürgen Klopp’s side have lost only once in the league this season and their recent wobble amounts to a couple of draws. But the timing of City’s return to the top could not have been better. By February the players will have started to look at their remaining fixtures and think about what points they will pick up where. A few weeks ago Liverpool would have feared nobody suddenly nothing looks easy – and their next two away games are at Manchester United and the Merseyside derby at Everton.We learned last season this City team are very tough mentally, they never lose focus. But with Liverpool, having not won the title since 1990 and given the way their last serious challenge fell apart in 2014, there is more of a question mark. I am fascinated to see how they respond. Of course City are capable of dropping points, and it is likely both teams will between now and May. But who will slip up first? More than the impact on the table, more than points and positions, the most significant advantage that will be surrendered by whoever falters first will be psychological. At this stage in the season calmness and confidence are vital, and perhaps it was the motivation Liverpool had given City along with the chance to go top that ensured Pep Guardiola’s side won the game against Everton on Wednesday before a ball was kicked.Liverpool may be more comfortable as the chasing team, the underdogs. They may end up looking back at the past fortnight, in which they have dropped points, played poorly, been knocked off the top yet remained, despite it all, in control of their own destiny, and think this was the decisive period, one that forced them to come together as never before and gave them the impetus to claim the prize that has eluded them for so long. Or maybe that mental strength just isn’t there. Recent results have thrown up a lot of questions – and what happens in the next few weeks will go a long way to providing the answers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da601dae4ab0f484c68dcde62440828541f85e93/0_0_4784_2872/master/4784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c7176eb67de2545222f0c4f891d369a","title":"arsenal v manchester united continental cup semi final live","story":"2 min: A cagey start from the kick-off, though Arsenal have settled into a possession game. Greenwood, United’s captain, is playing in midfield, and concedes an early foul. The sound from the Hertfordshire faithful is one of those songs that uses Earth, Wind and Fire’s September, while the Barmy Army’s “Manchester La La La” can be heard loud and clear. And a bit of “Red Army”, too. The teams have taken to the field at Boreham Wood, home of Arsenal Women, representative teams and a No Deal Brexit.There may be a good reason behind this - perhaps they don’t trust their followers to behave themselves - but seems odd that neither Arsenal nor Manchester United’s official accounts are tweeting about this match. Gunnersaurus is there, anyway. Coaches Joe Montemurro and Casey Stoney have been talking. “We’re taking it in our stride, we respect each team we play against,” said Arsenal coach Montemurro. Stoney is fired up but realistic. “It’s our biggest test, it’s a test we want, Arsenal are up there as one of the best teams in Europe. We know it’s a one-off game and we will try and have a go. They have the league’s top goalscorer. Will we dominate the way we have been? We know we won’t.”Word on Katie Zelem, Manchester United’s midfielder, who headed back to England after a spell at Juventus: I used to watch her father, Alan Zelem, play in goal for Macclesfield Town in the late-1980s. He was, as they say, a decent shot-stopper and a town hero, but my recollection is of him being quite small for a goalkeeper, not exactly great at goal-kicks and his rather high-pitched voice. A few of us at school used to attempt Alan Zelem impressions.Here’s the aforementioned Barmy Army. Great story here from Suzanne Wrack.Unfortunately, this is the big story in the women’s game today.Here’s a reminder of what happened last night. The final of this season’s competition will either be a Manchester derby, or a rerun of last year’s final, when Arsenal won the trophy for the fifth time when beating City. Only City, twice winners, and Arsenal have ever actually won this trophy, so a United win tonight presents the chance of a novelty. Manchester United may be the nascent moneybags team, but Arsenal, should they win their game in hand on leaders City, have the WSL within their grasp and have to be overriding favourites. United, even though they have a couple of games in hand on the rest of the chasers, are fourth in the Championship though they have lost just once season in the league and just once in the round-robin stages of this competition. Arsenal have a perfect record in in the ‘Conti Cup’, including a 9-0 walloping of Lewes. But how about the red-hot atmosphere that awaits Arsenal from away fans? “Casey’s at the wheel,” sing United’s Barmy Army, appropriating the Stone Roses song used for both José Mourinho and now Ole Gunnar Solskjær, for Casey Stoney, coaching against the club she served for two years. And how about these anthems, as taken from United’s official website?

The Ministry of Justice still appears to have no grasp of the history or purpose of legal aid, falsely claiming its ‘initial intention’ as being to ‘ensure that public funding will remain sustainable by refocusing resources on those who most need it’, whereas the white paper that preceded the introduction of legal aid described the purpose as ‘to provide legal advice for those of slender means and resources, so that no one would be financially unable to prosecute a just and reasonable claim or defend a legal right and to allow counsel and solicitors to be remunerated for their services.’“This modern MoJ obsession with restricting legal aid to ‘those who need it most’ (defined so narrowly as to exclude the very people it was intended to help), as opposed to simply those who need it, flies in the face of the original purpose of legal aid.

Ghose does not appear to intervene or challenge Hopkins about her remarks in the video.Amrit Wilson, former board member of Imkaan, a Black, South Asian and minority ethnic women’s organisation dedicated to combating violence against women, who shared the videos on Twitter, welcomed Ghose’s departure from Women’s Aid.She said: “I welcome it but Women’s Aid needs to question why this happened and make sure that future appointments are not only carefully vetted but given to people with substantial experience of the women’s sector.”Aaliyah Davis, of the direct action group Sisters Uncut, said she felt that although Ghose was acting in her capacity as the chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society at the Ukip conference, her praise for the party had “overstepped the mark”.“We were deeply concerned at the kind of language she was using. It felt like she was trying to garner support from Ukip. I and other members of Sisters Uncut feel she overstepped the mark saying that Ukip had been robbed and rightly there should be more Ukip MPs and it flies in the face of her position at Women’s Aid.”Davis said Ukip’s xenophobia and racism meant that Ghose’s behaviour was “shocking”, considering she would be appointed to lead the UK’s biggest domestic violence charity that has to represent migrant women and BAME women. “She didn’t need to say these things. It’s surprising this didn’t come up in the recruitment process – it feels like feminism has taken a back seat.”In a statement, Women’s Aid said Ghose was leaving “by mutual agreement with the charity’s board. It added: “Katie, as chief executive, has led Women’s Aid through a period of growth in our profile, impact and partnerships. She has achieved a huge amount in her time with us and brought her considerable leadership abilities to achieve influence in Whitehall and Westminster. The trustees thank her for her commitment, hard work and professionalism and wish her the best for the future.”The charity said it could not comment further for legal reasons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/320612cd436c8ab348b5bb3de43d4add7b2c8b5c/0_0_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d491a231d996d48af90d96303003e18c","title":"brummies not yam yams and nine other unwritten rules of birmingham","story":"Britain’s ‘second city’ is its own world, with unique customs. Get to know the unspoken lay of the land There’s a whole country outside your window, waiting to be explored. That includes the nation’s second city the crown jewel of jewellery making, and my home: Birmingham.Brummies know that our city can be underestimated (it was once described as “very desolate everywhere” by Queen Victoria), but learn its ways and you too will discover its magic. These 10 unwritten rules will equip even the most insular traveller with the skills to become an honorary Brummie.Remember, Brummies and Yam Yams are differentBrummies are from Birmingham. “Yam Yams” are from Dudley.This fundamental difference is a matter of life of a banishment from the West Midlands. Locals don’t take well to being categorised among those who don’t share their postcode. The DYs and the Bs matter.The accent is supposedly different, but I don’t hear it much. I’d advise you to pretend to acknowledge their differences. Though engaging in a cold war, the Yam Yams and Brummies have shared a unified history from the height of the Industrial Revolution … and a unified aversion to the south. Also, don’t attribute the Industrial Revolution to Manchester. Not if you want to be invited back.When it comes to shopping, no stress allowedNo pushing, no shoving, and no jostling in the shopping areas – that’s not how we do things here. With more than a million residents, the city can feel busy and vibrant, but in our malls – The Mailbox, The Bullring – you won’t find hour-long queues and customers cramped up. It’s all very classy in Birmingham, so much so you can even pause for a snap in front of some art while you shop – that is Laurence Broderick’s iconic bronze bull statue (known as The Bull) outside The Bullring which has been named one of the world’s greatest works of public art.For the best bars, avoid the main dragsKeep away from main roads, otherwise it’s main road prices (who wants to pay £10 for a cocktail?), and what a waste that would be. Birmingham is one of the few cities with an affordable nightlife – the average price of a pint is £2.90 – and some great places to start the night are Suds ‘n’ Duds, a quasi-speakeasy disguised as a launderette, 40 St Pauls, a specialist gin bar, and Jekyll and Hyde, which boasts cocktails inspired by its namesakes’ creativity.Travel by rail to enjoy the best of the city’s nightlifeGetting into Birmingham couldn’t be easier, with London Northwestern Railway running trains to and from London and Liverpool – with stops at major towns and cities including Milton Keynes, Coventry, Wolverhampton and Crewe. The train will drop you at Birmingham New Street, slap-bang in the city centre and the perfect place to start your trip. Don’t battle for parking or against traffic – Birmingham is all about the peace and love – and instead, enjoy a tipple and let the train driver do the work.Do not argue about who birthed rock. It was BirminghamThis is an indisputable fact. You can even walk the road Ozzy Osbourne walked down to get to school. Although, for a music hit that’s a little more creative, visit Nick Drake’s grave in Tanworth-in-Arden or John Bonham’s in Rushock instead.You don’t have to spend a fortune to have a good day outCannon Hill park, Ikon gallery and Birmingham Museum \u0026amp Art Gallery are all must-sees and they’re free to visit, too. There are optional paid extras, such as access to dedicated exhibits, or a ride on the swan boats in Cannon Hill park, but you can have a great day out without breaking the bank.Real Brummies venture outside the cityThere’s plenty to do outside the city centre itself. Spook yourself out at Wychbury obelisk and its accompanying forest, home of the infamous mystery: Who Put Bella in the Wych Elm? You could also check out the Black Country Living Museum, where Peaky Blinders is filmed. And The Red House Glass Cone in Stourbridge is a bittersweet tribute to long-dormant artisanal glass-blowing that the town was famous for in its heyday.Do not miss Soho House (no, not that one)Readers of celebrity magazines might be familiar with London private members’ club, Soho House. But Birmingham’s answer is even better heeled. Soho House is a tranquil Georgian home to refresh your mind and learn something while you’re at it. Along with the standard afternoon tea opportunities that come with stately homes, Soho House hosts talks on the textile industry, women of the Lunar Society and Cafe Scientifique, an informal science debate featuring guest speakers.Watch out on the escalatorsLondoners, are you tired with order confining you to the right-hand side of the escalator? Lucky for you, the West Midlands operates on a free-for-all basis. Want to stand in the middle and have no one attempt to push past you? Want to lean on the left-hand side? Revel in it and stand wherever you want. Want to get past someone? It’s anyone’s game at this point. Godspeed, dear reader.Birmingham has more canals than VeniceSorry, Venice.

What is it about this work that makes it resonate still in today’s world?No one in Prague a hundred years ago would have thought that Janáček would be valued a century later as one of the greatest opera composers of the 20th century. Until the hugely successful Prague premiere of Jenůfa in 1916, when the composer was 62, he was viewed by the chattering classes of the Czech capital as something of a wild and woolly “backwoodsman” from the eastern region of the Czech lands, Moravia. Janáček certainly did not fit comfortably into the traditions of Czech opera in the post-Smetana era.And yet in a modern age his stock is unquestionably high. His operas can shock, even wound, but they are often ravishingly beautiful, powerfully emotive and, above all, true. Today, with three productions of the same opera in the UK in the next few weeks, one can only conclude that something is up. Scottish Opera, Opera North and the Royal Opera House are all staging productions of Janáček’s Katya Kabanová in February and March.Katya has a strong performing tradition in the UK. Janáček’s sixth opera was first performed at Sadler’s Wells in the spring of 1951. The conductor, recently returned from studying with Václav Talich – one of the greatest Czech conductors of the 20th century – was a young Charles Mackerras.It also did well under the Czech conductor Rafael Kubelík in 1954, the 100th anniversary of Janáček’s birth, but failed to attract UK audiences later in the decade. However, a decisive moment came with the visit of the Prague National Theatre to the Edinburgh festival in 1964 when, according to the Observer, Jaroslav Krombholc conducted with “almost unbearable lyric intensity”. A new production at ENO in 1973, again under Mackerras, secured Katya’s place in the repertoire.The Czechs have never been entirely comfortable with Janáček. The favourites in Prague have always been Smetana’s The Bartered Bride and Dvořák’s Rusalka. Smetana’s comic masterpiece offered audiences at its premiere in 1866 a comforting view of rural life in which relatively simple problems have heart-warming solutions, and it proved an enduring recipe. Almost 40 years later, Janáček confronted the harsh realities of life in the country with Jenůfa in which drunkenness and abuse of women play a major part. The irresistible catharsis at the end of that opera offered something much more transcendental than a cheery final chorus in national dress. Kát’a, however, went a great deal further in depth of characterisation and was the end of a painful personal, if ultimately triumphant, road for the composer.The passionate involvement Janáček felt for the subject matter of all his compositions, whether opera or string quartet, was perhaps strongest in 1921’s Kát’a Kabanová. The triumphant Prague premiere of Jenůfa five years earlier had vindicated his reputation and after a decade of neglect by Prague’s cultural elite, Janáček was at last accepted and celebrated internationally.What is more, he was newly in love with a much younger woman. Kamila Stösslová became his muse during his astonishing final decade. While Stösslová enjoyed the attention of a now celebrated musical figure, it is unlikely that their relationship resulted in anything other a sublimated surge of creativity on Janáček’s part, with her presence hovering over the central female characters of Katya, The Vixen and Makropulos. There is no doubting thatKatya was a work of love Janáček himself claimed that the composition of the opera had flowed like “the beautiful river Volga”.His depiction of Katya , a heroine driven to infidelity and finally suicide, is the work of someone very much in love. Equally poignant is the way he depicts the stifling context in which she lives: the small town of Kalinovo on the Volga with all its hypocrisy, a mother-in-law from hell, the terrifying Kabanicha, who not only tries to dominate her, but everyone around her including her hopeless son, Tichon.The play by Alexander Ostrovsky on which the opera is based has a rather broader focus on the repressive social dynamics of the town. By changing its title from The Thunderstorm to Kát’a Kabanová, Janáček not only brought it into an ambit typical of Czech opera where a large proportion of works bear women’s names, but signalled that his primary concern was with the personal tragedy of the central figure.He captures Katya’s fragility, most harrowingly in the moment of reverie just before her fatal plunge into the Volga, and her potential for exultant joy, communicated most memorably in her description of her reactions in church where she imagines angels flying through the haze of incense to heaven. As important in securing our sympathy for her, however, is the chilling contrast between the petty concerns of the bourgeois town in which she finds herself and her own volatile, passionate nature. Her suicide can certainly be seen, as Ostrovsky intended, in part as a final protest against the stifling mores of the town’s citizens and the domineering Kabanicha, but Janáček’s music transmutes it into a much more personal drama. Throughout the opera he employs great economy of means, from the brooding opening of the prelude to the dizzyingly rapid close in which Katya’s body is brought up from the river asthe Kabanicha, bowing graciously to the horrified crowd utters the concluding words of the opera: “Thank you, good people, for your attention.”The inescapable feeling left is not just the palpable hopelessness of the male characters, but of the dominating presence of the women: at one extreme, the unchallengeable almost monochrome monstrosity of Kabanicha balanced by Katya’s fragility, volatility and overwhelming desire for love. Katya Kabanova has become a welcome part of the repertoire – inspiring as well as frightening, but most of all, challenging our assumptions and prejudices.• Katya Kabanova is at the Royal Opera House, London, until 26 February Opera North’s production runs until 21 March, Scottish Opera’s new production opens on 12 March. Jan Smaczny is emeritus professor of musicology and composition at Queen’s University Belfast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c72bc2b1b54079364edaa5d064d5edd4dcbc89f9/0_165_2819_1691/master/2819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9d139f5331e4fcbd2844ef1e832faa6","title":"thank u next why pop stars fell out of love with albums ariana grande","story":"Chart-toppers used to focus on long-players. Now, in the streaming era, they can release tracks whenever they like – and many, including Ariana Grande, have decided to do just thatWhat’s your favourite Ariana Grande single of the past nine months? Was it April’s No Tears Left to Cry, or July’s ballad God Is a Woman? Maybe it was September’s anti-anxiety anthem, Breathin. Perhaps you weren’t a fan of Sweetener, the album that housed all three, and preferred November’s Thank U, Next, a single from a forthcoming album of the same title released this Friday. That global chart-topper was followed a month later by Imagine, which has now been replaced by 7 Rings.Grande’s more-is-more attitude not only demonstrates how rapidly streaming culture has reshaped the way music is released, but, as she outlined in a recent interview with Billboard, how it liberates her from the music industry’s traditionally long-winded release cycle (“Do the teaser before the single, then do the single, and wait to do the preorder, and radio has to impact before the video, and we have to do the discount on this day”). Instead, she releases music direct to her fans, “in the way that a rapper does”.Grande’s rapid-fire release strategy aligns her with a host of emerging pop artists who pepper streaming services with tracks, collaborations, acoustic covers, EPs and so-called “retail mixtapes” (basically an unofficial album) on an almost weekly basis.Australian pop star Betty Who says it is about circumnavigating the music business “middlemen” rather than seeing which songs connect with fans. “I don’t feel like I’m trying to find what sticks. I get to make the music I want to make and I don’t have to get permission from anybody.”Fellow Australian singer-songwriter Emmi has a more complicated relationship with streaming services. In 2016, Taylor Swift included Emmi’s track Sleep on It on her playlist of new music, and more people started paying attention. “Every artist falls prey to the notion that doing anything is better than doing nothing, particularly when there’s a buzz, and your fans are filling up your DMs with: ‘So what’s next?’” she says. “It’s possible you just release because you feel the pressure to keep people happy.” Still, she’s currently releasing a trilogy of playlists. One, out already, follows a relationship from start to finish another is inspired by Shakespeare. “Much like curated playlists on Spotify and Apple, each one has its own mood, style and concept,” she says.Neither Betty Who nor Emmi are on major labels. But for acts that are, such as Anne-Marie and Dua Lipa, this kind of strategy, where a succession of songs are released until one takes off, and then the album follows, can risk boring fans who were in at the start.For Mabel, another major-label pop artist, the trek to her debut album has been a long one. Since her arrival in 2015, she has released 12 singles, an EP and a mixtape, Ivy to Roses. An album is mooted for this year, close to two years after her biggest hit so far, Finders Keepers, a song that took months to build and ended up spending five weeks in the Top 10. Ivy to Roses, originally released in 2017, has recently been expanded to include her new single, Don’t Call Me Up. It has a lot riding on it after her previous single, One Shot, peaked at No 44. In the world of streaming, however, artists can quickly move on from a flop with tracks used to tide fans over before a hit kickstarts an album campaign.So what of pop’s old guard, used to things called “CDs” being sold in places called “record shops”? “Big pop artists need to re-establish themselves in a modern context,” says Chute. “You might spend years planning a new album only to return to a landscape where you have to give half of that music away pre-release, as it boosts your profile.”Olly Murs, who hasn’t added to his tally of eight UK top 10 singles since streaming data was added to the charts in 2014, released a double album last year featuring one side of new songs and one of greatest hits. Recently, Dido rolled out a campaign involving two “promotional singles” ahead of what then turned out to be the proper lead single, a tactic that might have worked had either of the early tracks taken off. Cheryl, meanwhile, is releasing songs on a track-by-track basis, with no threat of an album as yet her comeback, Love Made Me Do It, peaked at No 19.This shift in the mechanisms of pop is embodied by one of its most interesting practitioners, Charli XCX. Having released two traditional albums, in 2017 she put out two album-length mixtapes. Over the next two years, she released six “proper” singles including the Troye Sivan-assisted 1999. When the latter became a hit, she announced that 2019 was the year she would record a new album, tweeting “about time, right??”. Ultimately, the album remains attractive to artists – it can get you Brit and Grammy nominations and a No 1 position, and can allow you to craft a narrative.Perhaps, then, the future is an overlapping of the traditional and the disruptive. “Artists are just putting out what they want, when they want these days, and calling it whatever they need to,” says Emmi. “I think it’s an exciting time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6f84e733526d67ba0ae91daa75d92f76e25032c/0_153_4060_2436/master/4060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a383a839d61adf38b632ac036a5c4c50","title":"is climate change way worse than we realise today in focus podcast","story":"David Wallace-Wells, the author of new book The Uninhabitable Earth, depicts a world ravaged by climate chaos.

Speaking to the  from Brussels, the Greek MEP Giorgos Kyrtsos insisted that it was still too early for concessions to be made by Brussels.“Talking tough is the EU method. At this stage everyone wants to be seen to be talking tough before an initiative can be taken to reach a compromise,” said the conservative who sits on the European People’s Party working group that deals with Brexit. He went on:Today was about gaining political time. Senior politicians in the US have warned that a post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the US would be in jeopardy if there there was a return to a hard border in IrelandDemocratic congressman Richard Neal, who chairs the ways and means committee, the chief tax-writing committee of the United States House of Representatives which oversees trade deals, said he had already raised it with the US trade representative. He said:We want a bilateral trade agreement with the UK, but at the same time I think I would raise concerns that I raise now, and that would be obviously no return to a hard border.Republican congressman Peter King also expressed concern. He said:We as Irish Americans make it clear when we deal with the British that this is very, very important and if the British want to consider any kind of trade agreement with the United States, it’s important that soft border is maintained.They were speaking during a trip by Ireland’s deputy prime minister Simon Coveney who is on a campaign to secure a seat on the UN security council. Coveney said he was not there to ask US lawmakers to take sides. He told RTÉ News:We’re not here in the US to lobby against the UK. We’re not asking people to take sides - an Irish position or a UK position.Owen Smith, the Labour MP and pro-European who challenged Jeremy Corbyn unsuccessfully for the party leadership in 2016, has told Radio 5 Live that he is considering leaving the party because of its stance on Brexit. In an interview with Emma Barnett, when asked if he could in all conscience remain in the party, Smith replied:I think that’s a very good question - and I think it’s something that I and lots of other people are considering right now.But Smith also said that no decision about his future in the party was imminent. Explaining his thinking, he said:Here are the main points from Theresa May’s clip for broadcasters. (It wasn’t really an interview. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg had three questions, but May did not engage with them, and the whole thing was over in two minutes.)Crucially, President Junker and I have agreed that talks will now start to find a way through this, to find a way to get this over the line, and to deliver on the concerns that parliament has, so that we get a majority in parliament.What I see and hear from leaders is a desire for us to work together to ensure that we can deliver the UK leaving the European Union with a deal.My work is to deliver Brexit, to deliver it on time, and I will be negotiating hard in the coming days to do just that.And I’m clear that I’m going to deliver Brexit, I’m going to deliver it on time, that’s what I’m going to do for the British public. I will be negotiating hard in the coming days to do just that.This is what Theresa May said about Donald Tusk’s anti-Brexit “hell” comment yesterday. She said:I’ve raised with President Tusk the language that he used yesterday, which was not helpful and caused widespread dismay in the United Kingdom. The point I made to him was that we should both be working to ensure that we can deliver a closer relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in the future, and that’s what he should be focusing on.As a reminder, this is what Tusk, the president of the European council, said yesterday.By the way, I have been wondering what the special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely.Theresa May is now speaking to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. She says she has had a good series of meetings. They have been robust, but constructive, she says.She says she explained that there must be changes to the backstop. They will have to be legally binding, she says.She says she and Jean-Claude Juncker have agreed that there will be further talks.Q: Donald Tusk talked about hell yesterday. Aren’t you stuck in some kind of purgatory?May says she spoke to Tusk about what he said. She told him it was not helpful.Antonio Tajani, president of the European parliament, and Guy Verhofstadt, the parliament’s lead Brexit spokesman, have been speaking to journalists after their meeting with Theresa May.Here are the key points.It is important that Mrs May today in the meeting assured us that there will be a backstop, that - what she said already in Belfast - there is no question to remove the backstop. Because that is absolutely necessary for securing and safeguarding the Good Friday agreement, safeguarding the internal market and safeguarding also the peace process. For us, an all-weather backstop insurance is absolutely key.It is a disaster on both sides of the Channel and it is, in fact, irresponsible from some politicians in Britain to go for such a no deal and to prefer such a no deal.We cannot have an agreement with uncertainty in the UK based on majorities of six, seven, eight, nine votes in the House of Commons. Cross-party cooperation is the way forward, and I can say that we welcome also the letter that Jeremy Corbyn has written today to Mrs May to offer such a cross-party exit. It is important now that this leads to a position in the UK that has the broadest possible majority so that we can conclude this negotiation.Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has recorded a clip for the BBC saying Jeremy Corbyn’s letter to Theresa May setting out five demands for Brexit (see 9.36am) does not rule out a second referendum. Corbyn will be writing to Labour members today confirming this, he says.Starmer is keen to speak out because he has become the most prominent champion in the party of those pushing for a second referendum. What he is saying in this clip, and what he said in a tweet earlier, echoes what he said in his speech to the party conference, after delegates agreed a compromise motion saying: “If we cannot get a general election Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.”But no one ever said the Corbyn letter does rule out a second referendum - because it doesn’t. What is significant about it is that at no point, in a reasonably long letter, does Corbyn even mention a second referendum, even though it did feature in the Labour amendment on Brexit debated last week. When Labour’s Brexit policy was agreed at party conference, some in the party assumed that it meant a failure to trigger a general election would automatically lead to the party backing a second referendum as its next move. Corbyn’s letter confirms that that is not the case - because the priority now seems to be getting Theresa May to accept Labour’s proposals. Corbyn does not rule out voting for a second referendum if May rejects his plan, but party sources have been saying explicitly today that that is not the leadership position. (See 11.17am.)Starmer is fighting a rearguard battle to keep the second referendum option in play. But today’s developments make the prospect of Corbyn embracing this idea seem even more extremely improbable than it was, which is why pro-Europeans in the party have been complaining.

Three writers log their health and fitness weeks – from swimming to meditation – as they embark on a journey to wellnessIt’s been my ambition to do the splits since I was a teenager. My last attempt, at a Christmas party, didn’t end well. I had to be physically carried off like a sack of potatoes and left in a darkened room with nothing but deep regret and a bag of frozen peas for company.I can’t do that again, so either I have to stop showing off or I’d better get more flexible, and, if we’re being completely honest, the second one is easier. Given the number of women doing the splits up a mountain on Instagram while talking about their #yogajourney, I figure yoga is the place to start. My week begins with some deep ing into YouTube and I discover Yoga with Adriene. She’s funny, a good teacher and – best of all – she doesn’t speak with a wispy, breathy voice.Next, I buy a 30-day unlimited class pass from my local yoga studio. This allows me to try lots of different classes throughout the week, ranging from an absolute beginner’s introductory session and a slow-paced and gentle yin class to a more dynamic vinyasa flow class. Four days in, I even pluck up the courage to try a hot yoga class, where I entirely underestimate how hot and crowded the room will actually be.I tell one of my teachers that I want to be able to do the splits between two moving trucks like Jean-Claude van Damme and she laughs in my face. But I remain undeterred. I’ve even downloaded an app called 1 Second Everyday that nudges me to record a daily video. The app then stitches the footage together so I can see my progress. (It mainly reveals how I’ve pretty much been wearing the same workout gear day in, day out).One week in, I’m not even close to my splits ambition, but that’s OK. It’s nice to get into a routine – even if it’s just 10 minutes of yoga first thing in the morning or last thing at night or, better still, the odd yoga class during my lunch break. Plus, everything they say about yoga boosting your energy is, unfortunately, completely true. I’m sleeping better and crashing less at work. And I think I might be becoming unbearably smug. Guys, hold on tight, I’m on my #yogajourney.Meditation has always been one of those things that I have mentally filed away in a box marked “Sounds Nice But Not For Me”. Yes, I would theoretically love to experience its purported calming and energy-boosting benefits, to briefly hit pause on the frantic whirl of work and social obligations and the corralling of two young kids. But I could never justify it to myself. Gifted with a free hour I will happily head off on a long, mind-unknotting run, play tennis or even, creaky 35-year-old knees be damned, hop on a skateboard. But, just, sitting there? Doing nothing? Ridiculously wasteful.So, it’s fair to say that I approached a week of guided meditation with a degree of apprehension. And my first day – firing up a newly downloaded mindfulness app at the start of an overwhelmingly busy seven days – is only a partial success. I perch on the edge of the bed mid-morning, shut my eyes, follow the soothing instructions and try to focus on my breath. But my mind keeps snagging on all the things I’m meant to be doing andor pondering how much voiceover actors get paid to do a mindfulness app.But then, on day two, something clicks. I open my eyes after a three-minute session (which I’ve now made part of my pre-shower morning routine) and I feel transformed. Rested. Calm. Vaguely atingle and utterly blissed-out. It is as if my mind has been on a micro-spa break. My pile of tasks is still there but, somehow, it doesn’t feel as insurmountable. And it occurs to me that, in contrast to the somewhat stressful logistics that precede a game of tennis or even a run, this is a quick, easy emotional battery charge I can always fit into my day. All that and the prospect of fewer embarrassingly acquired skateboarding injuries. I feel calmer already.There’s something about the prospect of gliding through water that elicits a child-like glee in me, but as I emerge from the changing rooms and glimpse the intense blue of the pool, my excitement is replaced by a creeping anxiety. I haven’t swum in a long time. I’m not a beginner by any means – I reached level 6 in my school days – but despite the pool being quiet, I feel intimidated. After a couple of deep breaths I lower my body into the shallow end of the pool and tread water for 10 minutes, but I can’t quite muster up the confidence to swim. I leave.On my second visit, the pool is busier and just before I get in I see a swimmer doing a beautiful butterfly stroke – I used to able to do that quite effortlessly too. I linger by the changing room doors until the swimmer has gone. Once they leave, and before a new set of people appear, I decide this time I just need to go for it – I haven’t come all this way to just tread water again! I submerge my body into the pool, and propel myself forward with a kick, alternating my arms. My anxiety evaporates, my body acclimatises to the lukewarm water and my muscles relax. I lose my balance slightly, but I persevere. I manage a few, somewhat scrappy but determined strokes to get to the other side of the pool and then come up for air – I haven’t felt this energised for as long as I can remember.Later that week, I return and my confidence grows even more. Swimming in my own lane feels good. But I’m beginning to realise that carving out this time in my week is giving me so much more: space to reflect on the whirlwind few months I’ve had since publishing Slay in Your Lane, and time to reflect on my next move as a writer.

While being told to discuss the possible misuse of images, words and videos online with their children, the recommendations ask adults to curb their own oversharing.“Parents and carers should never assume that children are happy for their photos to be shared,” the recommendations said. “For everyone – when in doubt, don’t upload!”The guidelines come days after a report by the Commons science and technology select committee flagged a lack of high-quality research into the effects of screen time on young people, including studies that explored the impact of particular uses of screens.A commentary by the chief medical officers that accompanies the guidelines also stressed that more research was needed.However, the officers said immediate action to safeguard young people is necessary by the government, social media platforms and technology companies. Among their suggestions are that the latter sign up to a voluntary code of conduct to protect children online, before the possible introduction of new laws.Further recommendations echo those of the committee, including calls for tech companies to share anonymised data to aid research. The officers also said those who sell technology should make sure consumers are aware of child security features and shown how to use them.Andy Burrows, the associate head of child safety online at the NSPCC, agreed urgent action is necessary.“For over a decade, tech giants have failed to protect their young users, and we can’t waste any more time waiting for them to clean up their act,” he said.“We urge the government to legislate without delay, to make social networks accountable and punish them if they fail to keep children safe.”Dr Bob Patton, a lecturer in clinical psychology at the University of Surrey, said it is impossible at present to break screen time down into “good” and “bad”, since it is highly dependent on content and context.“Idly flicking through a social media site is not the same as doing research for a project or homework – clearly those are very different activities – but at the moment, they have all got lumped together into a general ‘how much time do you spend on the screen’,” he said.The advice for parents and carers includes:• This article was amended on 7 February 2019.

Walker’s cerebral palsy means he has poor coordination and movement, but since last spring Alexa has reminded him to take his medication, as well as automating other tasks around his home.Previously, Walker, who works at Next, used light from his television to get into bed, but can now turn the room lights on and off with his voice. “I haven’t fallen since I’ve had this machine,” he says. “It’s feeling you are in control of your life. My father doesn’t have to worry I am taking my pills at the right time.”An estimated five million UK households have a device that runs either Alexa or Google’s equivalent, according to the research firm Enders Analysis. While most people use chatbots – software that recognises spoken or written natural language and responds in kind – to play music or get answers to questions, there’s increasing interest in people using them to take greater control of their lives. “It could stop a partner becoming a carer,” Walker points out. Walker’s speaker, provided as part of a pilot run by Hampshire county council for 50 recipients of adult social care, does not replace regular visits from care workers to help with physical movement, but means he can do more for himself. Many social care visits are brief calls to check on whether, for instance, someone has taken their pills. If chatbots can replace some of these shorter visits, it could mean care workers being able to spend longer on more useful visits.Graham Allen, Hampshire’s director of adult health and care, says almost three quarters of those in the pilot felt the device helped improve their lives and almost as many felt it had improved their independence, with numbers fairly consistent across different ages. “It’s not a cure-all,” he says. “It needs to be used along with other measures.” But he can see potential for many care service users living at home, and the county’s children’s social services department has just started issuing similar devices.A number of public sector organisations have introduced chatbots, so far mainly to provide information and enable people to report problems. The politan police  is reported to be developing ways for people to report crime via voice-activated systems. School menus in Hampshire are all  online and Amazon’s Alexa can answer questions about them. from parents and children. The Cabinet Office’s government digital service has taken a similar approach with the gov.uk website, so voice-activated speakers can get answers to detailed questions on, for example, the minimum wage for 17-year-olds.Some organisations have gone further. In June 2017, Transport for London launched a text chatbot that uses Facebook Messenger. “It’s useful for people, particularly in their early 20s and 30s, who are more used to the conversational style of messaging platforms,” says Ben Gammon, head of digital services.The TfL chatbot helped more than 29,800 users with travel queries in the last three months of 2018, is available all the time and provides up-to-date, consistent information, says Gammon. “Customers who have simple questions can get an answer while on the go more easily rather than having to search online or call our customer services line.”Aylesbury Vale district council, which runs both text and voice-based chatbot services to deal with a wide range of queries, uses staff to check most queries and, if necessary, edit software-generated responses. The software does provide automatic answers for a handful of the most common queries, but a member of staff still monitors this work and responses are marked as being from an automated system. “ It is important to be transparent,” says Maryvonne Hassall, the council’s digital strategy manager. Last spring, the London borough of Waltham Forest introduced its Walt environmental reporting chatbot, accessible through Messenger and direct messages to a Twitter account @WFTellWalt. It accepts reports on problems such as fly-tipping by asking a short series of questions, with smartphone users able to pass on their locations and pictures of problems. Reports are passed on to the council’s contractors, and people are notified when a problem is solved – something the council says users appreciate. But building chatbot services is expensive for councils, particularly as they are unlikely to be used as much as other channels: three fifths of reports in Waltham Forest come from a standard website form, for instance, with only one fifth arriving through Facebook and Twitter and the rest by phone.Rocco Labellarte, Oxford city council’s chief technology and information officer, says building chatbots is not something councils can do on their own. The city is leading a group of 12 English councils with central government funding to collaborate on developing text and voice chatbots. When Oxford explored voice services, it realised it could afford to build only a couple – a drop in the ocean compared with the hundreds of services most councils provide. If the collaboration’s initial assessment phase justifies further funding, the group hopes to develop text and voice chat services for adoption by more councils. Labellarte led the introduction of the Amelia chatbot service at the London borough of Enfield, which handles queries and requests for permits and authenticates licences. He says that, despite initial set-up costs, chatbots will save councils money by automating the task of answering queries. Labellarte says this could enable people to move to more complex work, where demand is increasing, but there are fears that automation could lead to staff losses and Mariarosaria Taddeo, research fellow at Oxford University’s internet institute and deputy director of its digital ethics lab, believes public services need to exercise care when introducing chatbots. This includes making it clear when bots are in use: “It’s important that users realise there is a machine on the other side,” she says. It also means ensuring automated systems are fair. Many chatbot systems rely on machine learning and there is growing concern about built-in bias. Automated systems can make organisations more efficient – but they must be supervised by real people, says Taddeo.  In Aylesbury Vale, Hassall says chatbots can provide a better service when it comes to factual questions, because they give a consistent response. But she adds that real people should continue to deal with complex queries and anything that requires compassion, such as the result of medical tests. “You need people to engage with people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9711e9640f7a7b206b8c34d2d5c6c8187edb4d6f/0_57_2884_1731/master/2884.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de019fb3a92cc21551d32e09dc584d92","title":"ireland england touch of panic six nations","story":"While they may have lost by only 12 points against England, the scoreline did scant justice to the hiding suffered by Ireland in Dublin last Saturday. Outfought, out-thought and bullied in their own backyard, they looked a shadow of the rugby juggernaut that had swept all before it for the previous 12 months. A team and their supporters harbouring realistic hopes of winning the World Cup this year were forced to endure the rudest of awakenings.It was a timely boot up the backside. Ireland’s grand slam clincher at Twickenham last March preceded a series win in Australia that was followed by a rare win against the mighty All Blacks. These results and a subsequent clean sweep of the most prestigious gongs at the World Rugby Awards may have prompted alickadoos in rugby clubs the length and breadth of Ireland to get a little carried away. Following England’s invasion and subsequent occupation of the Aviva Stadium, Ireland’s second place in the world rugby hierarchy no longer looks quite as secure.“I think there is a touch of panic actually,” says Simon Hick from the Second Captains sports podcast, upon being asked to gauge the public mood. “It was such a thorough emptying and we got worse as the game went on. We got caught at the start and it got worse and worse and worse. We’d completely run out of ideas and didn’t look dangerous at all. I think when we play England, especially in Dublin, there’s an assumption we’re going to be up for it and play like wild men and that just didn’t happen.”Joining Hick for the post-mortem, the former Ireland scrum-half Eoin Reddan preached the need for patience. “We should really be giving everyone a bit of space here,” he said. “There’s been a long-term plan in place for a long time.” The  rugby correspondent Gerry Thornley stressed that, while their humbling was a disappointing defeat and performance, “Ireland have not turned into a bad rugby team overnight.”Speaking to the radio station Newstalk, the former Ireland coach Eddie O’Sullivan suggested that “England were on a bit of a mission and they ambushed us” in much the same way Ireland have subjected them to similar shock and awe tactics at Twickenham in the past. “The source of their tries was just putting the ball in behind us – forget about the interception and the other was an error by Keith Earls – so despite everything they’re all fixable,” he said.The responsibility for coming up with solutions lies with Joe Schmidt, the head coach who has made five changes – three of them enforced – to his side for Ireland’s trip to Murrayfield. “We were very quiet before the game,” he said. “I didn’t sense the same energy levels I would have in November when the All Blacks came. I didn’t sense it, I didn’t feel it. You almost sense this sense of vibrancy from the group and we didn’t have it.”The Irish Independent’s Rory O’Connor described Schmidt’s demeanour in the immediate aftermath of the game. “He didn’t take a huge amount of responsibility for anything himself,” he said. “Everything was other people. He was asked would you have done anything differently and he said no. Whether you agree with him or not, he’s very clear in his head about what went wrong.” Facing the press when Ireland reconvened at training, Tadhg Furlong declared there was no need for panic. “Losing games is never nice but it doesn’t mean you throw it all away either and start changing things massively,” the prop said. “If we get back the accuracy that we can bring, we’re confident we can bring a performance as well.”While internet forums and message boards are not always the most accurate barometer of informed public opinion, Furlong’s seems to be a view shared by the majority of Irish fans. There has, however, been a clamour for the recall of Simon Zebo following Schmidt’s brief and unsuccessful experiment in switching Robbie Henshaw from centre to full-back, a position where Ireland lack strength in depth. “My phone is always on,” said Zebo, who is playing in France and therefore not being considered due to an unwritten rule that says home-based players are preferred.Almost as shocking as the nature of Ireland’s defeat last weekend was the sight of the Aviva Stadium rapidly emptying despite plenty of time being left on the clock. “I was really surprised,” says Hick. “There is always a chance Ireland can come back and 10 minutes is a long time in a rugby game. It was completely flat and there was no sense of hope or excitement in the stadium. An awful lot of people left early.”So many that it was perhaps those fans who stayed until the bitter end that beat the traffic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75c528892fe7eede9e2702803dd12b1bd6405535/0_105_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09759126ce0b1352b75cf965fdd2e5bd","title":"rugby clubs ticket six nations viagogo","story":"Six Nations tickets that appeared on the resale website Viagogo for inflated prices were leaked via local rugby clubs, it has emerged, prompting warnings that unfettered resale poses a threat to the game’s grassroots.The Rugby Football Union told the  that it sanctioned 57 clubs over ticket resale in 2018 alone and it is understood they have warned them that they risk being stripped of their allocation for international fixtures.It comes after the  revealed that more than a thousand tickets for the tournament had appeared on Viagogo for £370,000, despite resale restrictions that might lead to buyers being refused entry at the turnstile.Subsequent inquiries have revealed that tickets are routinely being resold by members and corporate sponsors of local rugby clubs, which are allocated tickets by governing bodies.Several Viagogo customers said they had received tickets that were clearly part of clubs’ initial allocations.Judy Bowen paid £2,120.48 for four seats at Twickenham to see England v France, despite the tickets having a face value of £100 each. She said the final price due to be paid was unclear and she was even more shocked when later told by the RFU that the tickets were invalid and would be cancelled.According to information printed on the tickets, they were initially allocated to Rosslyn Park, via the RFU’s system of distributing tickets to local rugby clubs. The south-west London club told the  an internal investigation had discovered the tickets were issued to one of its corporate sponsors. “Club sponsors, along with members of Rosslyn Park, are reminded annually of the RFU and club’s policy on the resale of international tickets,” a spokesman said. “The corporate sponsor is now taking internal disciplinary action with the inidual concerned.”Bowen said the process of securing a refund from Viagogo, which she eventually managed, had been “more than a pain”.Adam Dockery paid £4,612.82 for five tickets to see Ireland v England at the Aviva Stadium last weekend, despite the tickets having a face value of €110, only to be denied entry at the gate. He is still trying to secure a refund from Viagogo.His tickets were initially allocated to Banbridge, in County Down, Northern Ireland, the same club where the Irish team’s captain, the hooker Rory Best, is registered.A spokesman for the club said the member responsible for reselling their tickets on Viagogo had since had their access to tickets withdrawn. “Banbridge RFC are firmly against reselling of tickets and will withdraw access to tickets from any member found to have done so,” a spokesperson said.The governing bodies of the countries taking part in the Six Nations typically issue a large proportion of tickets via rugby clubs, who then pass them on to their members. One source at a rugby club told the  that members reselling tickets could threaten the very existence of the club. The source said if the RFU were to sanction the club by reducing or ending its allocation, it could suffer a membership fall‑off because some people join largely to gain access to international tickets.An RFU spokesperson said: “If there is a suspicion that tickets are misused, this will initially be examined by the RFU. The club will be contacted to obtain an explanation, and the RFU will then decide on an appropriate sanction, if applicable, against set guidelines. This can result in a club losing some or all of its ticket allocation in subsequent seasons.”Claire Turnham, who was awarded an MBE for her efforts in securing refunds for consumers through her Victim of Viagogo Facebook group, said: “As a rugby-loving Kiwi it’s devastating to realise the allocation of international tickets may be lost because of this appalling greed. Reselling is responsible for ripping the heart of the game at a grass roots level.”Viagogo said: “The reason nobody can get a Six Nations ticket from the box office is because the RFU doesn’t make tickets available to the general public.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1fd612a346c8f5e5213cc71520d234615deb878/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15b2dfa1f0bc52ae5de2147b3062bda2","title":"free diving antarctica in pictures sahika ercumen","story":"Şahika Ercümen, a world record-holding free-er from Turkey, is ing in Antarctica as part of a scientific research mission.

He means things have got so fluid, with one art form blurring into another, it’s hard to give it a simple definition.He’s well at home at Manipulate. The self-styled festival of “innovative visual theatre and animated film” is the kind of event where you’ll find puppetry without puppets and dance that isn’t really dance. Certainly, I don’t know what you’d call Extremely Pedestrian Chorales (★★★☆☆). Created by choreographer Karl Jay-Lewin and composer Matteo Fargion, it’s like a dadaist riposte to Strictly Come Dancing. Jay-Lewin has codified walking movements into a sequence of eccentric square dances. They are surreal and inconsequential, but performed with the deadpan concentration of competition dancers.The four performers follow instructions from a score – three steps backwards, a leap to the left, a fast shuffle forward – while keeping to mathematical rhythms worthy of a jazz drummer. They introduce each short piece with an enigmatic title – “Out of the depth, I scream” – as if we were watching an otherworldly pop gig. Every so often, they give the cue for a Bach chorale, sweetly sung at the side of the stage by a seven-strong choir but rudely interrupted whenever the dancers have had enough. For all its charm and novelty, however, it is too knowing, an in-joke lost in its own hermetic universe.Wunderkammer (★★★☆☆) by Tübingen’s Figuren Theater is more firmly what you’d expect of an object-theatre festival. It’s a sequence of exquisitely crafted string puppets broodingly lit and set to a forceful soundtrack of percussive keyboard, as if the very ribs of the skeletal marionettes had been turned into music.Three manipulators take turns to open jewellery boxes, out of which crawl spidery hands, weightless acrobats and Chinese kites. There are hints – and only hints – of dinosaurs, birds and reptiles, as if evolution has taken an odd turn to produce two-headed men and people with spines that taper into nothing.Much of the pleasure is in the puppets themselves one furry monster need do nothing more than roll its googly eyes to win a roar of approval. The company is overreliant on this, too often letting the puppets flop around aimlessly after their initial appearance. But even if it is low on dramatic interaction, Wunderkammer has poetic beauty to match its technical dexterity.Best of all is Invisible Lands (★★★★★) by Finland’s Livsmedlet Theatre. It’s the story of refugees, represented by tiny figures, like the population of a model railway, delicate and vulnerable as they flee their war-ravaged home. What makes the show extraordinary is the path they travel. Every mountain pass, snowy outcrop, desert expanse and night-time highway is created by the bodies of Ishmael Falke and Sandrina Lindgren.The performers take turns to bare their flesh as the figures line up for their perilous journey. Falke’s back becomes their escape route from a smoking village Lindgren’s stomach, painted blue, is the sea to Europe knees turn into hill tops, feet form the rendezvous for a bus. The pulses of the performers breathe life into the models as they queue at border crossings, flee helicopters and crowd on to boats. It’s masterfully done, the combination of physical effort and contrasting scale making the wordless tale devastatingly sad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a430250ba6c0bcde7ba5c22baf40e72487e007b1/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e997d2d2a8435cc547a284f0ff410055","title":"five things every aspiring vegan should have in their kitchen","story":"From flax seeds to coconut oil, these ingredients will make your vegan diet easy and deliciousIt’s a common misconception that being vegan is both tricky and dull. The truth is, there are simple food switches we can make to eat fewer animal products, and with the likes of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s introducing non-dairy versions of some of its most popular flavours, being vegan is now easier than ever.Here are five simple store cupboard updates that will help you be a little more vegan …Flax seedsThe sheer number of things you can use flax seeds for is, quite frankly, mind-boggling.First off, flax eggs. One tablespoon of ground flax seeds mixed with 2-3 tablespoons of warm water becomes a mixture that has the same texture and volume as egg white. You can use these flax eggs in place of chicken’s eggs when binding bakes or adding body to things such as pancakes.Ground flax seeds are also a powerful thickening agent for everything from porridge oats to pasta sauces. Adding a subtle nutty taste and a slightly crunchy texture, they work best with deep flavours such as curries.What makes flax seeds even more essential for vegans is that they contain omega-3, the same kind of good fats you get from oily fish. These oils are essential for optimal brain function, blood flow and can even help reduce the risk of heart disease, so if you’re not getting enough flax seeds in your diet, now’s a great time to start.Keep them whole, boil them with some water and you can even make your own glue or hair gel with them – check out the videos online if you don’t believe us.A word of warning: once ground, flax seeds start to lose their beneficial properties over time, so if you buy them whole, grind them up in a smoothie maker and store them in the fridge. That way, you’ll get the most from these mighty, mini seeds.ChickpeasWhen we say chickpeas, you probably think hummus, and rightly so. Hummus has become a firm favourite in the UK over the past decade, enhancing mealtimes as a condiment and serving up a time-saving savoury snack when combined with veggies or pitta bread.If you have a blender and have never made hummus, you’re missing a trick. It’s a whizz – just blitz a can of chickpeas with a tablespoon or two of tahini, olive oil, lemon juice and salt, then add a teaspoon of water at a time until it all turns into that wonderfully familiar, rich, pale, hummusy-textured gloop.Chickpeas aren’t just tasty, though – they’re an excellent source of complex carbs and fibre.And whatever you do with your can of chickpeas, don’t throw away the water. Known as aquafaba, this juice is rich in starch and is a great egg replacement for making meringues or macarons.Pasta sauceWe’re all busy people, and having a staple, cost-effective “meal in minutes” recipe can be the difference between success and failure when embarking on a new diet. What’s handy is that vegan quick fixes can be pretty similar to non-vegan ones, with a piping hot, saucy bowl of pasta being up there with the best of them.Other than puttanesca, which contains anchovies, most jars of tomato-based pasta sauces are free of animal product.Nutritional yeastThe name might make you think of baking and bread, but unlike traditional yeast, nutritional yeast is deactivated, so it doesn’t rise when warmed and wet. It has a distinctly nutty, cheesy taste and looks a lot like fish food flakes.An insider vegan secret for a long time, these tart, deep and earthy-tasting flakes can be sprinkled over pasta as a parmesan replacement, combined with probiotics, ground cashews and agar-agar – a vegan gelatine substitute – to make vegan cheese. They’re also excellent in a crumb coating when whizzed up with some flax seeds.Coconut oilIn a world with no dairy, coconut oil reigns supreme as the most indulgent alternative around. Combined with almond butter and some agave, it’s a sweet, satisfying snack. Melted and ready to get sizzly, it’s the base flavour for the richest stir-fries and curries. And if you’re using cold-pressed coconut oil in baking, it adds a creamy, subtly tropical aroma and taste to everything from brownies to cookies.Melting at around 24C (76F), it tends to stay solid at room temperature in most climates, and in a similar way to cocoa butter, becomes liquid when melted in our hands or mouth.In addition, cold-pressed oil – the pricier variety – can raise levels of good cholesterol. Meanwhile, the cheaper, standard coconut oil carries no coconut flavour, so is an excellent, versatile fat for cooking coconut flavour-free dishes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/538d43627198d0539941584f404163bbe4bd630b/0_0_4446_2668/master/4446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a7f448a8e7af7ce27175bfcbc4c949b","title":"back up bookmarks google","story":"Jenifer wants a backup while EC wants a replacement for Google+, which is shutting downI have a lot of bookmarked sites for medieval manuscripts on my laptop, which it took a long time to collect. How can I back them up in case the laptop dies? JeniferAs you know, Google is closing Google+ in April. I currently use the site as my online bookmarking tool. Can you suggest something that is easy to use both online and on mobile? ECFirst things first, Jenifer. You should have a backup of your whole hard drive in case your laptop dies. Your operating system almost certainly includes usable backup software. Otherwise, there are more than 30 free third-party alternatives for Windows including BackUp Maker, AOMEI Backupper Standard and EaseUS Todo Backup Free.Fortunately, almost all browsers let you save bookmarks into a single file in the web’s HTML format. Double-clicking this file will load it in a tab in your default browser, where you will be able to click the links to your heart’s content. In fact, some people find that having their bookmarks as a local webpage is handier than folders of bookmarks. The drawback? The saved document isn’t updated when you add a new bookmark.In a well-designed browser such as Vivaldi, you can go to the File menu and simply select “Export Bookmarks …” to create a backup file. Opera is almost as good – you select Bookmarks then “Export Bookmarks …” – but most browsers now make it more complicated.In Firefox, for example, you have to use the obscure Library button, or press Ctrl-Shift-B (for Bookmarks), then click the drop-down menu item for “Import and Backup”. In Google Chrome, you can press Ctrl-Shift-O (for Obscure, I assume) to load the bookmark manager or, like me, type chrome:bookmarks in the address bar and hit enter. After that, click the three dots in the blue Bookmarks bar and select “Export bookmarks”.In Microsoft Edge, click the three dots for Settings, or press Alt-X, then the “Import from another browser” button. The export routine has been cunningly hidden behind the import routine.Once you have saved a file called Vivaldi_Bookmarks-20190207.html or something similar, you can stow it somewhere safe. The options include an external hard drive, a USB memory stick, an SD card and so on. You should also load the file – drag and drop usually works – into one or more of your free online storage spaces such as Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Apple iCloud, Dropbox or whatever you prefer. Once the file is online, you can access it from other PCs, smartphones, tablets and other devices.You can even store your bookmarks in a Microsoft Word document, which will preserve any layout and provide Ctrl-clickable links. I do this by loading the HTML file into a browser, saving it as an MHTML or MHT file, loading that into Word and then saving it as Word file (eg as a doc, docx, rtf file, etc). Internet Explorer can save files in the standard MHTML format. Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome, Vivaldi and Opera can also save MHTML files if you edit the settings (chrome:flags or vivaldi:flags or opera:flags etc). Alternatively, add a browser extension such as SingleFile, which works in both Firefox and Chrome. (MHTML usefully encapsulates whole web pages in a single file, without creating a subdirectory to hold loads of separate js, css and other files.)Browsers generally use folders and subfolders to manage bookmarks. Many of them including Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi and Edge also have synchronisation systems built in to sync bookmarks across different devices, which can be used to restore them onto replacement computers should the worst happen. However, folders can become unwieldy when you have hundreds or thousands of bookmarks, which is where bookmark managers come in.Bookmark managers generally allow you to add tags, notes and comments. Tags are useful because you can give each link multiple tags, which is like putting them in multiple folders.Bookmark managers should also provide an extension or bookmarklet so that you can bookmark sites from your browser, without going to the bookmark manager’s website.Google has one of the simplest bookmark managers, which is deservedly obscure, but could suit some users. Apple’s iCloud Bookmarks is rather better, and works in several different browsers – Safari, Firefox, Chrome, IE but not Edge – on many different devices.I have not used many bookmark managers or checked for online apps, so you’ll have to try a few to find something you like. The options include start.me, Bookmark Ninja, Dropmark, Raindrop.io, Bookmax, Atavi and, for Chrome only, Booky. Sadly, two of the most popular sites in this category – Delicious and Xmarks – have closed down.There’s also the excellent Pinboard, which now costs $11 a year. Pinboard is run by its founder, Maciej Cegłowski, who bought the remains of Delicious.  Technology used Pinboard for a few years for linkbucket blog posts.Pocket – which is incorporated into Firefox but available for Chrome – would work as a bookmark manager, but is generally used for saving pages to read later. Instapaper does much the same thing.Most researchers who need Zotero will already know about it, though it could well suit someone who likes medieval manuscripts.Otherwise, people who habitually use Microsoft OneNote or Evernote will know they can work really well as bookmark managers, as well as storing web clippings, photos, documents and many other things.Bookmarks graduated from being personal directories to shared resources on sites such as Delicious. This gave rise to social bookmarking and, from 2005-07, a boom in folksonomy or collaborative tagging. In other words, lots of different people adding tags to public links. Delicious was the archetypal example of the genre. Lots of us loved it.Folksonomy was replaced by #hashtagging. This is exactly the same thing, except that hashtags can be applied to anything, not just bookmarks. The main hashtagging sites include Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. But they are social networking sites, not bookmark managers.I would not have suggested Google+ as a bookmarking site, but perhaps its failure as a social network helped make it viable for that purpose. You could replace it with Bookmax (where free accounts are limited to 1,000 links) or Raindrop.io, but Pinterest might be the best alternative.The basic idea of Pinterest is to create public displays, but you can have any number of “secret boards”. These are private by default, though you can share them with selected people. You could create a separate board for each set of bookmarks to cover news, movies, music etc.Either way, you should download your data from Google+ before it closes on 2 April. The download page lets you select posts from your page and Google+ Communities in HTML format, plus contacts from your Circles. These are in vCard format by default, but you can select CSV, HTML or JSON instead. It doesn’t matter because you only get their name, nickname (if any) and their doomed G+ address. You don’t get their email addresses, phone numbers, job titles or anything else that might be useful.You can have your takeout data sent to Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox or Box, or download it from an emailed link.

Beyond joining local races, there’s an increasing number of “parkrun tourists”, who plan trips in order to tick off unusual and spectacular routes from Singapore to South Africa.There are even unofficial clubs with their own lingo to denote their achievements: the Alphabeteers, who tick off parkruns for each letter of the alphabet the Cowell club (100 or more different events) Fielding club (250 different UK events), Freyne club (250 different global events) Yorkshire Pud-done (all the runs in Yorkshire and the Humber) East-Did-Lands and West-Did-Lands (all the parkruns in the east or west Midlands) and Going for Bailey (attempting to run your first 100 runs at 100 different events).All parkrun events, which are managed by volunteers, stay true to the original aim of being free and inclusive. “Unlike traditional running events that may require pre-registration, entry fees and cut-off times, at parkrun it is free to participate and speed is not important,” says Chrissie Wellington, head of health and wellbeing at Parkrun. “The popularity continues to grow by empowering local communities to implement a permanent mixed-gender, multi-generational health intervention that appeals to a broad cross-section of society. Particularly those for whom physical activity and volunteering is not the norm.”Here are 10 of the best routes in the UK and around the worldNicknamed “Beauty and the Beast”, this route rewards runners with spectacular views after a 210-metre ascent. Whinlatter is one of England’s only true mountain forests, with a route though Douglas fir trees. With a red squirrel reserve and osprey nesting in the valley, it’s also a great area for spotting wildlife.The park’s landscape is breathtaking and varied, with rugged cliffs and sandy beaches giving way to hills and woodland, and a coastal path stretching 186 miles. In a valley at the eastern end, Colby Woodland Garden, near Amroth hosts a parkrun, with three laps along trail paths through the meadow and forests.When it started in September 2012, this was the first beach parkrun in the world running entirely on sand. The out-and-back route starts in the town and heads out along the along the wide sandy beach of Whiterocks. Views on the outward run include Dunluce Castle ruins, the Giant’s Causeway headland and the Skerries, a small group of uninhabited islands around a mile from the coast. The group usually congregate at the watersports centre for tea and cake post-run.The first parkrun to launch outside London, this route laps the beautiful urban park close to the university campus three times. It’s popular with visitors and locals as one of the oldest parkruns but also for its volunteers, including George Webster, 18, who’s become something of a local celebrity in the parkrun world. George, who has Downs syndrome, started as a token collector and has now completed 56 parkruns. He is also a “parkrun star”, acting as an advocate for their life-changing impact and encouraging others to get involved.Australia’s third-largest island is home to an abundance of wildlife, including wallabies, koalas, seals and the eponymous marsupials which vastly outnumber the human population of 4,700. The island, in the state of South Australia, is a 45-minute ferry ride from the mainland port of Cape Jarvis. The coastal parkrun, which launched in 2017, starts and finishes at the tidal pool in Kingscote, the island’s biggest town.With the waves of the Atlantic on one side and golden Namib Desert sand on the other, this is a flat course popular with locals and visitors. The town is one of the largest in Namibia, with a well-kept promenade, wide roads and German colonial architecture, and was one of the first places in the region outside South Africa to host a parkrun.The parkrun team here say they’ve seen an increase in tourists from the UK, Australia and beyond, thanks to the views the route offers. On the first mile, runners see San Francisco Bay and Golden Gate Bridge, depending on the fog. On the return leg, there are views to Alcatraz, the Palace of Fine Arts, and the San Francisco skyline, including the futurist-looking Transamerica Pyramid, the second-tallest building in the city at 259 metres.The first country in south-east Asian to host a parkrun, Singapore now has three. East Coast Park was the first, with a beach park route along a manmade sandy shore. Runners here can enjoy a post-event picnic under the palm trees or a dip in warm Singaporean Strait waters. The route starts at 7.30am rather than the usual 9am, to avoid the humidity, and weaves along the coast between Buddhist monks and dog-walkers.Taking in two countries in one run, this route starts and finishes in the Polish town of Cieszyn but crosses into the Czech Republic along the way. The city was ided between the countries in 1920, following a short border war, with Cieszyn the larger neighbour of its Czech sister city, Český Těšín. The city parkrun here straddles the River Olza, which forms part of the boundary between the two countries. Another two-for-one run is the Severn Bridge parkrun from Wales into England and back, which launched last year. • This article was amended on 7 February to state that Singapore has three parkruns instead of two.

The school is just one of 30-odd buildings – relocated to the 32 hectare site – from different eras of Highland life from the 1700s onwards.

The massive site has plenty of re-erected buildings to peek inside and hands-on activities to try, like a trip down a coal mine, a Victorian lesson in the village school and watching a silent movie in the tiny cinema. There’s lots of delicious Black Country grub available too, and no visit is complete without what are surely the best fish and chips in Britain.

Young readers reveal why they adore it – from the sarcasm to the timeless love stories ... and Fat MonicaA new survey into teenage media habits done by Childwise shows that the New York-based comedy is the favourite TV show of viewers aged five to 16 in the UK. It’s a remarkable statistic, given that the majority of those surveyed would not even have been born when the series ended in 2004. We asked you to tell us why you love Friends. Here’s what some of you said:It gives us all hope that everything will work out. In real life, friendships don’t happen like they do in Friends and neither do relationships, but I think everyone who watches it wishes they did. I also think people love the idea of always having someone to talk to and share things with.My favourite character is Chandler. I think he is underplayed: many people like Joey and Phoebe because they are seen to get all the best lines, but Chandler has a different type of humour – one that I appreciate! His relationship with Monica is perfect, too, and they balance each other out.My favourite episode has to be The One with Five Steaks and an Eggplant. It’s a bit of an odd choice as the gang are at ends with each other, but I love how they do everything they can to work things out. This is really rare nowadays, when a tiny disagreement can end friendships. Molly, 15, HertfordshireI watch Friends almost every day and when I finish the 10th season I rewatch it. I find out a lot of things about life from the show. I like being treated like an adult when I hear people talking about it and I can join in. I have only been allowed to watch it since May as I’m nearly 12.I don’t have a favourite character – I have a list. My top favourite is Fat Monica. Second is Rachel and third is Chandler. Chandler is funny because he’s sarcastic and I like sarcasm.I like all the flashback episodes, but my favourite is where Rachel and Monica watch the Thanksgiving tape and see Ross about to take Rachel to prom. Leah, 11, EnfieldFriends is relatable to nearly every person, as well as being funny. It involves scenarios people my age are starting to go through, but instead of taking them seriously, it manages to make a joke of every single one. It’s based on everyday lives, and most people can relate to one of the characters. My favourite character? That’s a tough one. I’d have to go with Phoebe, because of how she deals with everything that comes her way. She gets herself into situations that are just hilarious.There are too many good episodes to choose from, however one of the best would be The One with Chandler and Monica’s Wedding: Part 2, when Rachel’s pregnancy is revealed to Monica and Phoebe. When Phoebe finds the pregnancy test she assumes it is Monica’s. When Phoebe realises that it is in fact Rachel’s, instead of revealing it, she says she is the one who is pregnant with James Brolin’s child and that she needs to call and let him know! Sam, 16, LeicesterI love Friends because it’s one of the first series (in another language) I ever watched. When I watch episodes again, it’s like going back to my comfort zone.If I had to choose a favourite episode it would be the one when Phoebe and Ross discover that Monica and Chandler have been going out. It’s SO funny … but I think I watched it too many times. Sol, 16, Rosario, ArgentinaFriends has surprisingly been a conservation-starter with a few of my friends. It’s like the glue that sticks us together. Plus, the show stands as the epitome of how friendship should be. Whenever I watch Friends, I fantasise about a friendship circle I would like to have. The silly jokes and the awkwardness between the characters are bonuses.My stand-out character is Phoebe because she is silly but smart and knowledgeable. For a person who you might think would have anger bottled up, she seems pretty calm. She takes control of her own life and she is not abashed about what she does and what she thinks. Hal, 17, IndiaFriends handles issues such as orce, unemployment and unrequited love in an excellently comedic way. It perfectly captures sibling rivalry between Ross and Monica that is surprisingly relatable. It looks at the difference of class and intellect between the friends and you get to know each one personally until you realise there is more to them than meets the eye.My favourite character has to be Chandler. His witty lines, physical comedy and mannerisms just turn him into a super lovable character. Also he’s kinda fit (good looking)! I think everyone has parts of all the characters in them, no matter how much you try not to. (Ross is my least favourite character. He’s so ANNOYING).All the episodes are really funny! If I had to choose a favourite, it would either be the one where Chandler hooks up with one of Joey’s sisters but can’t remember which one, or (spoiler alert) the one where Ross and Rachel finally start dating.

Inside he was suffocated and then his body was dismembered, according to a Turkish investigation.In a preliminary report, Callamard said that she had heard “parts of the chilling and gruesome audio material obtained and retained by the Turkish intelligence agency”.Callamard said Turkey’s efforts to carry out a proper investigation had “been seriously curtailed and undermined by Saudi Arabia”.She said: “Woefully inadequate time and access was granted to Turkish investigators to conduct a professional and effective crime-scene examination and search required by international standards for investigation.”Callamard, a French human rights expert, is due to deliver a final report to the UN human rights council in June. On Thursday she provided an assessment of her visit to Turkey to pursue the investigation, from 28 January and 3 February.She said that Saudi killers had exploited diplomatic immunity to carry out the murder.“Guarantees of immunity were never intended to facilitate the commission of a crime and exonerate its authors of their criminal responsibility or to conceal a violation of the right to life,” Callamard said. “The circumstances of the killing and the response by state representatives in its aftermath may be described as ‘immunity for impunity’.”US intelligence chiefs have told Congress that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, almost certainly ordered the killing or was aware of it, but Donald Trump and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, have insisted that the evidence is incomplete and investigations would continue.Pompeo is due to meet the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, in Washington on Thursday afternoon.Riyadh has denied the prince was involved. The Saudi public prosecutor has charged 11 men with the murder, saying last month that he would seek the death penalty for five of them.Callamard said she had “major concerns” about the fairness of the Saudi proceedings and had asked to visit Riyadh.“The murder of Jamal Khashoggi and the sheer brutality of it has brought irreversible tragedy to his loved ones,” she said. “It is also raising a number of international implications which demand the urgent attention of the international community including the United Nations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75e283acb09f96165ff1a38dd9cfa799d494cea4/0_30_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=798d3cc8481644e2f992719a6d7f2525","title":"west stirring up unrest in zimbabwe to force regime change briefing","story":"Party briefing blames ‘rogue NGOs’ and ‘hostile intelligence services’ for violenceZimbabwe’s ruling party believes western powers are behind a “revolution” to bring about regime change in the country, according to documents seen by the .Briefing papers prepared by Zanu-PF officials blame opposition parties and “rogue NGOs” for “an orgy of violence” following a protest against fuel price rises last month, accusing them of following a plan “by hostile elements to subvert the state by rendering the country ungovernable”.The document is thought to have been produced by Zanu-PF officials for circulation among foreign diplomats at the African Union summit, currently underway in Addis Abbaba. It will concern observers already worried by the increasingly hard line taken by the Zimbabwean authorities.The protests last month led to sporadic incidents of rioting and looting, which prompted a brutal crackdown by the police and the army.The violence came 14 months after the 37-year rule of Robert Mugabe came to an end following a military takeover, and was the worst in Zimbabwe for at least a decade.Police documents seen by the  last week detailed the army’s role in a series of killings, rapes and beatings.In a report published earlier this week, a coalition of local NGOs described a “de facto state of emergency” and a “reign of terror” by the security forces, which they accused of being responsible for 1,800 human rights violations.They said these included at least 17 extrajudicial killings, 16 rapes, 26 abductions and more than 600 assaults. “The violations are systematic, unleashed mainly by male perpetrators whom the victims identified as wearing either military or police attire, armed with AK rifles and or baton sticks, travelling in army and police vehicles. The targets of attack were initially male population in high density suburbs but later become indiscriminate to include women and young girls”, the report, by the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum, said.More than 1,000 people have been detained in the crackdown, including labour leaders, activists and officials from the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), the main opposition party. Many face lengthy sentences. Seven have been charged with subversion, which could lead to up to 20 years in prison.Zanu-PF has denied all responsibility for the disorder.The 24-page briefing document, seen by the , is titled: “Brief on the political and security situation in Zimbabwe in the aftermath of the 14th to 16th January violent protests.” It is dated 30 January and stamped “Government of Zimbabwe”.The Zanu-PF document describes the security forces’ response as “proportional to the threat posed”, though it adds: “Unfortunately some misguided elements within the system and the security forces committed excesses and the law is now taking its course.”The briefing says reports of abuses are aimed at prompting western intervention in Zimbabwe.Analysts are ided as to whether the more moderate position of the president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, who succeeded Mugabe and won a contested election last year, is genuine or designed to deflect foreign criticism.The recent violence now means it is very unlikely that Mnangagwa, who has said the government “regrets” the loss of life but has defended the crackdown, will achieve his stated aim of ending Zimbabwe’s pariah status and unlocking the massive financial aid necessary to avert total economic collapse.On Tuesday the UK said it would not back a bid by Zimbabwe to return to the Commonwealth because of recent human rights abuses and was “further” from backing any economic assistance package.This suggests that basic commodities such as food, fuel and medicine will remain both scarce and increasingly expensive.On Wednesday, Mnangagwa invited leaders of the more than 20 political parties that participated in last year’s disputed polls to a “post-election dialogue” at his State House office.The talks were snubbed by the MDC leader, Nelson Chamisa, who said he wants any dialogue to be independently mediated by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), a regional organisation, and guaranteed by the African Union and the UN.A Zanu-PF spokesman did not respond to requests to comment on the views contained in the leaked briefing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd7d01dcf0e15f66f97c89e2494990efc4cc131/0_325_4916_2951/master/4916.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf0f95e9c8313ba737993fbf2162382a","title":"new zealands waitangi day 2019 celebrations in pictures","story":"The national holiday celebrates the signing of the treaty of Waitangi on 6 February 1840 by Māori chiefs and the British Crown that granted the Māori people the rights of British citizens and ownership of their lands and other properties"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3786013.1549567536!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nurses strike health service is embarrassing says frontline gp","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish Nurses and Midwives Organisation  general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha with  nurses during a strike day at St James Hospital, Dublin. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsDr Michael McGloin, who heads up the Primary Care Centre in Athenry, 25km (15.5 miles) east of Galway city, says the nurses’ strike action is just another symptom of a crumbling health service.Eight public health nurses, who work at the busy care centre, are on strike along with three nurses who work at the centre’s stretched mental-health day hospital.Services were suspended on Tuesday and Wednesday. Dr McGloin said he does not know what will happen when the service is cancelled for three days next week.“Our public health nurses work here seven days a week. They hold clinics every day, tending to post-surgery patients, carrying out pregnancy and baby developmental assessments, and so on. The service is stretched to the limit already.”He said there will be a strike for three days and patients are being told to go to their GP if there is something urgent.“At the moment, we don’t know what the impact of the strike action will be on hospital out-patient lists locally, but what we do know is that there are already hundreds and hundreds of people waiting.“I had a woman come in to see me yesterday. She had pneumonia and I wanted to send her to hospital immediately but she absolutely refused to go. She said she would take her chances at home rather than face into A\u0026ampE, where she knew she would be left lying on a trolley and subjected to Dickensian-style treatment due to nursing shortages.”“The whole thing is crumbling and nothing’s being done to stop it,” Dr McGloin said.“Take, for example, the Autistic Spectrum Disorder Clinic, which is based here at the Athenry Care Centre. It offers support to children with autism from counties Galway and Roscommon who don’t have an intellectual disability. At present, children have to wait two-and-a-half years to be assessed and then another two-and-a-half years to be seen to avail of the support. And once they turn 18, they’re discharged with no service after that.”Dr McGloin says he has become embarrassed by the health service. “We have Canadian medical students here regularly and five years ago I would have boasted about how comprehensive and how good our health service was, and now, it’s an embarrassment. There is just no certainty about anything anymore.”He contends the primary-care model is the only thing that works at present. “We are picking up all the pieces but we just do not have the capacity for any more,” Dr McGloin said. “I am close to retirement and I’m working harder now than I ever did.”\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3785888.1549565655!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a everything you need to know about your metabolic age","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar was shocked to discover his metabolic age: “Surprised to hear that, kinda wondering about the science.” Photograph: RTÉTaoiseach Leo Varadkar was surprised to discover he had a metabolic age of 53 on RTÉ’s Operation Transformation programme. Having just turned 40, Mr Varadkar’s first response was to query the science behind the measurement: “Surprised to hear that, kinda wondering about the science.”Our Science Editor Kevin O’Sullivan investigates the concept of metabolic age. What is the significance of metabolic age?Metabolic age is based on your basal metabolic rate, commonly known as BMR. This is the amount of energy or kilocalories you burn a day to keep your body functioning, before you do any activity, compared with the average in your age group. It shifts the focus away from weight alone as a health indicator, to looking at the body’s composition of muscle and fat.Is there any science behind it?Typical metabolic age testing accurately takes into account visceral fat around the stomach, weight, muscle mass and percentage body fat, by standing on scales and attaching electrodes to the hands and feet. Combining the data in the electronic device yields your metabolic age.Does it matter? Muscle burns more than fat, so the fitter and healthier you are the better and lower your metabolic age. An older metabolic age may mean there is work to be done on fitness or diet – in some instances, there can be another contributing medial problem. Metabolic testing is significantly more accurate than tests used in the past. A dietician can use a person’s height, weight and age to estimate metabolic rate, but the results are not as reliable.If your metabolic age is lower than your actual age, it means your body is in good health. if your metabolic age is higher than your actual age, it may mean you have health problems or may need to change your eating and exercising habits.Can you improve your score? Yes. A combination of diet and exercise can over time improve your score in most cases. As one gets older, metabolism slows down and maximising muscle mass may become a more important priority.Are all tests the same?Your BMR can be calculated by range of devices now widely available. More streamlined devices cost between €70 and €350 and are available in pharmacies, gyms and sports clubs. In hospitals and clinical settings much more sophisticated technology is used capable of taking a wider range of measurements. Operation Transformation working with the Irish Pharmacy Union offered free tests this week at over 430 pharmacies across the country – the device used was a “body composition analyser” made by scales manufacturer Tanita, which is supplied by the Irish company Pharmed. Typically, a test in a pharmacy can cost up to €5, though some outlet offer the service free of charge. In the UK, it cost 50 with a consultation. In a clinical setting, which tests can including cardiovascular health assessments, the cost is considerably higher.Who should do the test? Determining your BMR is useful information, especially if in a weight-loss programme or seeking to improve fitness. So the test can help make better use of a workout by helping to determine what form of exercise works best. It’s easier to manage your weight when you know how many calories you burn daily – and it can vary depending on the inidual. With this assessment, you learn how your natural metabolism is helping or hindering goals."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3785363.1549553336!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hayley from clare explains why she sent thank you card to juncker","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe card was supposedly sent to Brussels by a Dublin family, according to a spokesman for the Department of the TaoiseachThe woman who sent a card to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker thanking him for his support for Ireland in the Brexit negotiations says she was surprised to receive a response. Hayley from Co Clare told RTÉ’s Liveline she was delighted the message had resonated with so many people. Mr Juncker produced the green-coloured ‘Thank You from Ireland’ card at a press briefing on Wednesday with Taoiseach Leo Varadker. Many observers had assumed that it had come from the Taoiseach, but Mr Juncker said it was sent by an Irish citizen. Hayley said she had “absolutely no agenda” in sending the card and anticipated Mr Juncker would not even see the card let alone respond publicly to it. “I’m literally just one person in Ireland. It is literally me, my husband and my two dogs,” she told Liveline. “Anybody who knows me knows I’m big on thank you cards. If my niece gets an A, she gets a card in the post. I happened to make it giant, only because I am that sort of person.”A picture of the card’s inside reads: “Dear Mr Juncker, I will be honest. I never really understood the importance of the EU.”It continued to say the EU “was something we learned about in school, a part of history, more than a part of today.”The sender went on to praise Mr Juncker, “but your five words, ‘Ireland’s borders are Europe’s borders’ made me want to jump for joy, punch my hands into the air, and kiss you. For the first time ever Ireland is stronger than Britain. That strength comes not from guns or bombs, it comes from your words and that of your colleagues.”She then went on, semi-seriously she claims, to state: “Britain does not care about peace in Northern Ireland. Ireland to them is a nuisance. The UK do (sic) have an alternative. They can keep Northern Ireland in the customs union by handing it back, that which they stole by brute force, to the Republic of Ireland (kind of). “Mr Juncker you broke the internet, Mr Juncker you broke the mike. I am forever in your debt. As we say in Ireland, if you are ever around, we will have the kettle on for you (this means you are invited for a cup of tea). Just give me a heads up if you are coming so I can get the place clean for you.” Ironically, she sourced the card from a British company, Moonpig. com and the card was sent from Britain with a British postmark. Hayley, who declined to give her surname because she said she has faced online abuse, told Joe Duffy her comments about Ireland now being stronger than Britain had gained a lot of traction. “Ireland does need to be proud of the support the EU has given. In my lifetime, it is nice that this little island of Ireland is now mighty. We are strong and we are able to stand up to people to whom we weren’t able to stand up to before.” She also detailed some of the responses to her card online. One read: “Whingery is part of the Catholic mindset. Poland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Portugal - all priest-ridden, all sad nations of sadder underachievers. Protestants, step up, take responsibility, get on with the job and prosper”. Another stated: “I loved the Irish, but sometimes they come across as toddlers. It is not England’s fault that you have never organised yourselves to take your country back and turn it into a powerful place. It is no point claiming the 800 years of hurt and then sticking out your bottom lip like toddlers.” When a spokesman for Mr Juncker was asked if the EC president had received any well wishing cards from Britain, he said: “I have no idea, unfortunately.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3785865.1549565478!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"france recalls rome ambassador after minister met yellow vest leaders","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                             French policemen hold up French and EU flags on the facade of Farnese Palace, the French embassy in Rome.

File photograph: Tony GentileReutersFrance recalled its ambassador to Rome yesterday, for the first time since Italy declared war on France in 1940. The move signifies a serious rupture, unprecedented in postwar relations between European powers and only a step short of breaking diplomatic ties.Agnès Von Der Mühll, the spokeswoman for the French foreign ministry, announced the recall of ambassador Christian Masset in a short statement.“France has for several months been the object of repeated accusations, of baseless attacks, of outrageous declarations that everyone knows and bears in mind,” Ms Von Der Muhll said. In a remark so vulgar that it was little reported in France, the Italian undersecretary for foreign affairs, Manlio Di Stefano, recently said French president Emmanuel Macron “suffers from the syndrome of the small *****”.Mr Di Stefano is part of the populist Five Star Movement (M5S) whose leader, Luigi Di Maio, is a deputy prime minister and minister for labour.Matteo Salvini, the head of the far right League, interior minister and the strongman in the Italian government, said recently that he felt sorry for “millions of men and women in France who live with a very bad government and a very bad president of the republic”.For high-ranking officials from a founding member of the EU to support calls for the resignation of the president of a fellow founding member is also unprecedented.Mr Salvini attempted to ease tensions after the ambassador’s recall yesterday. He told the Corriere della Sera: “I am ready to turn the page in our relations with France, for the good of our people and I would be happy to meet Macron. But France must stop turning back migrants at the border.”On Tuesday, Mr Di Maio met representatives of the rebellious “yellow vests” movement in the French town of Montargis. He had urged them to “hang in there” last month.Mr Di Maio posted a photograph of himself with gilets jaunes leaders on Instagram, with the caption, “The winds of change have crossed the Alps. I repeat: the winds of change have crossed the Alps.”Mr Di Maio called the photograph “a souvenir of a beautiful meeting, the first of a series, during which we talked about our countries, social rights, the environment and direct democracy”.Christophe Chalençon, a gilet jaune leader who met Mr Di Maio, and who is launching a list for the May 26th European election, said he wanted “to clarify the relations between M5S and the League” because it was “out of the question for us to draw closer to the extreme right”. Mr Chalençon was satisfied that M5S was “a popular, centre left-wing movement”.The meeting “gave international value to our action,” Mr Chalençon continued. Mr Di Maio has invited the French protesters to Rome.Mr Salvini and Mr Di Maio both seek potential allies in the EU parliament. It was inadmissible that discord between the two countries “be exploited for electoral reasons”, the French foreign ministry said. Alluding to Mr Di Maio’s trip to Montargis, it added: “The most recent interference constitutes an additional and unacceptable provocation. It violates the respect that is due to democratic choices, made by a friendly, allied country. It violates the respect that democratically and freely elected governments owe to each other. The European election campaign cannot justify the absence of respect for other peoples or their democracy. ”The situation has worsened dramatically since Mr Salvini and Mr Di Maio came to power last June, but the deterioration in Franco-Italian relations started eight years ago, with the French intervention in Libya, and was aggravated by France’s response to migrants landing on Italian beaches."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3785316.1549522687!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk told to uphold belfast agreement if it wants us trade","story":"European Council President Donald Tusk has said there is a special place in hell for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan of how to carry it safely”. He was speaking after talks with  Leo Varadkar in Brussels. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFigures from the Irish-American caucus on Capitol Hill said they would definitely speak out fi the Belfast Agreement was threatened.Britain’s hope of striking a trade deal with the United States after Brexit could be in jeopardy if the Belfast Agreement is compromised by Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, senior US figures have warned.Speaking at an event in the United States Capitol building to mark the 100th anniversary of the Dáil, Republican congressman Peter King told an audience: “If the British want to consider any type of trade agreement with the United States it is important that the soft border is maintained.”He continued: “What influence we have, we will use it, in the Friends of Ireland” he said, referring to the Irish-American caucus on Capitol Hill. “We will definitely speak out.”His warning was echoed by Richard Neal, the Massachusetts congressman who was recently appointed chairman of the Ways and Means committee. The committee has sweeping powers over US trade policy, and would have ultimate oversight of any trade agreement signed between the United States and Britain after Brexit.Trade dealSpeaking at the event, which was hosted to honour Tánaiste Simon Coveney who is on a three-day visit to the United States, Mr Neal said that concerns about the Belfast Agreement would “weigh on his mind” as his committee considers a new trade deal between the United States and Britain.He said he has already outlined his concerns to the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, although he ultimately wanted a trade deal between the US and United Kingdom.“I think that America is heavily invested in the success of the Good Friday Agreement and anything that might disturb the success that America offered certainly would not be welcomed, that’s for sure. I think there are few parts of American foreign policy that have worked as well as being an honest broker in the run-up to the Good Friday Agreement, so we take great satisfaction in what happened and undoing it for a problem that appears as though the British government got themselves into, I think would be a step backwards.”In addition to Mr Neal, two other Irish-Americans – Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania and New York congressman Brian Higgins – are members of the committee.Later, in a speech, Mr Neal commended the Irish Government for the stance it has taken in the Brexit negotiations. “The way that the Irish government has remained so firm on that border is so gratifying to us here,” he said, noting that all parties in Ireland and Northern Ireland except one were unified on the issue.“It is extraordinary that that border has been as successful as it has been and there might even be a debate about going back to checkpoints,” he said.Former congressman Bruce Morrison also warned Britain about the difficulties ahead in negotiating a trade agreement with the United States – a key priority for Brexiteers who have pointed to their ability to negotiate a future trade deal with the United States, and other non-EU countries, as a key economic benefit of leaving the EU customs union. The US is Britain’s main trading partner outside the EU bloc, and exports to the US are worth an estimated 100 billion pounds to the British economy each year.“I think the British have made a lot of assumptions about trade agreements with the US and with other countries and frankly, from a hard-headed economic standpoint, dealing with the EU is a lot more important than dealing with Britain, so I think they have an uphill slog on that,” Mr Morrison said. “They’ve been talking to themselves and not talking to others in thinking how great it’s going to be to be out of the European Union.”Face-to-face meetingThe intervention from Capitol Hill came hours after Mr Coveney held his first face-to-face meeting with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo at an event in the US State Department, at which the Minister for Foreign Affairs discussed the need to protect the peace process in the context of Brexit.But Mr Coveney stressed that Ireland was not asking the United States to “take sides” amid increasing concern among the Irish-American caucus on Capitol Hill about the implications of Brexit on the Belfast Agreement.“I made it very clear to him that we’re not asking the US to take sides – Ireland over the UK or UK over Ireland,” Mr Coveney said. “But we are asking people here to think about a peace process that they have been very much involved in creating and sustaining, and using influence to ensure that decisions that are taken in relation to Brexit don’t undermine that progress.”Nonetheless, he said that Mr Pompeo, as well as representatives of other nations attending the global coalition against Isis on Wednesday, had discussed Brexit. “Obviously there have been a lot of questions today from US voices, but also many of the other ministers who were here today for the conference, all asking the same questions – where is this going, how can we avoid a no deal Brexit.”Mr Coveney’s visit continues on Thursday with bilateral meetings with member of Congress about Brexit and its implications for the border with Northern Ireland.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA Wire Europhile Labour MPs have rounded on their party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, after he offered to support Theresa May’s Brexit deal in exchange for significant concessions.Mr Corbyn wrote to the British prime minister on Wednesday evening, saying that Labour would support her agreement with the EU if the non-binding political declaration were changed towards a softer Brexit.“We recognise that any negotiation with the EU will require flexibility and compromise,” the opposition leader wrote.His five proposed changes include keeping the UK in a customs union with the EU, something that Mrs May has repeatedly refused to countenance because it would curtail the UK’s ability to sign trade deals. However, the tone of Mr Corbyn’s letter – and his willingness to accept the withdrawal agreement, with its controversial backstop to avoid a hard Irish border – deepened anger among Europhile backbenchers.Chuka Umunna, one of the main Labour backers of a second Brexit referendum, said Mr Corbyn’s letter was “totally demoralising”.“This is not opposition, it is the facilitation of a deal which will make this country poorer,” he said.Chris Leslie, another Labour backbencher, said Mr Corbyn had put Labour’s conference policy, which potentially includes support for options such as a second referendum, “in the bin”.Lucy Powell, a Labour MP who backs membership of the customs union and single market, said Mr Corbyn had made “a really significant move to break the Brexit paralysis”.Brussels meetingMPs on all sides of the Brexit debate are awaiting the outcome of Mrs May’s meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, on Thursday.The prime minister has so far failed to specify what alternative arrangements might replace the backstop, the insurance mechanism that Eurosceptics fear would trap the UK in a customs union with the EU. She has mooted a time limit to the backstop and a unilateral exit mechanism, options that have been previously rejected by Brussels.The EU has, however, indicated its willingness to amend the political declaration if the UK’s red lines change.With just 50 days until the scheduled date of Britain’s exit from the EU, Europhile MPs are running out of time to influence the process. They are expected to table motions next week, calling for an extension of article 50, the EU’s formal exit process, and also propose that parliament hold Brexit debates in which MPs could vote on different ways forward.Similar motions, put down by Labour’s Yvette Cooper and the Conservative Dominic Grieve respectively, failed last week, partly due to rebellions by more than 25 Labour MPs. None of the eight shadow ministers who rebelled was sacked from Mr Corbyn’s cabinet.Europhile MPs and some trade unions now suspect the Labour leader is manoeuvring to allow Mrs May’s deal to pass parliament, without Labour taking political responsibility for it.Along with a permanent customs union, the other Brexit demands made by Mr Corbyn are: close alignment with the single market a pledge to keep workers’ rights in line with those in the EU commitments on UK participation in EU agencies and “unambiguous agreements” on future security arrangements, including “access to the European Arrest Warrant”. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVirginia governor-elect Ralph Northam (centre) celebrates with lieutenant governor-elect Justin Fairfax and attorney general Mark Herring at Mr Northam’s election night rally in Fairfax, Virginia, in November 2017. All three men are fighting for their political lives. Photograph:  Aaron P BernsteinReutersThe political crisis in Virginia deepened on Wednesday when the attorney general admitted to wearing blackface in the 1980s at a college party, becoming the state’s third high-ranking Democrat caught up in scandal.Attorney general Mark Herring (57), who has expressed gubernatorial ambitions and called four days ago for Mr Northam to resign, admitted in a statement he donned brown face paint at a party in 1980 to impersonate a rapper.Mr Northam (59) acknowledged last weekend to having worn blackface – a practice dating to 19th century minstrel shows caricaturing slaves – in 1984 to impersonate Michael Jackson. His admission came after a conservative media website published a photo on Friday from Mr Northam’s page in his 1984 medical school yearbook showing one man wearing blackface beside another masked figure in robes of the white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan. After initially saying he was one of the two depicted in the photo, Mr Northam changed his story and said neither was him.A separate scandal engulfing Democratic lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax (39), who is black and would succeed Mr Northam were he to step down, intensified on Wednesday when a woman accused him of sexually assaulting her at the Democratic National Convention in 2004.Mr Herring, who like Mr Northam is white, is second in line to succeed the governor as attorney general.Republican twistThe simultaneous controversies embroiling the top three-elected politicians in the executive branch of Virginia’s government raised the unlikely prospect of Democrats losing the governorship to a Republican. Kirk Cox, Republican speaker of Virginia’s House of Delegates, is third in the constitutional line of succession.Mr Cox (61), a former high school teacher who has served in the state’s Republican-controlled House since 1990, issued a statement on Wednesday saying the controversies in the executive branch “are disturbing” but “will be resolved in due course”. In the meantime, lawmakers would focus on budget deliberations and “hundreds of bills remaining before us”.Legislators otherwise kept a low profile on Wednesday, ducking reporters as they left the state capitol in Richmond following Wednesday’s legislative session.Mr Northam has remained out of public view since Saturday, when he held a news conference to address the furore over his yearbook pictures, which sparked calls for his resignation from fellow Democrats in Virginia, a key swing state in the 2020 presidential race.Civil rights groups and at least five Democratic candidates for the White House also have urged Mr Northam to step down.Despite the Democratic Party’s current zero tolerance for bigotry and sexual misconduct, Democrats might be motivated to rally behind Mr Northam if faced with the prospect of Republicans suddenly assuming the governorship.In his statement, Mr Cox singled out the allegations against Fairfax as “extremely serious”. The lieutenant governor has acknowledged knowing his accuser but on Wednesday repeated his assertion their encounter was consensual.The woman, Vanessa Tyson, in a statement issued by Washington law firm Katz, Marshall \u0026amp Banks, said that Fairfax forced her to perform oral sex on him in a hotel room.“I cannot believe, given my obvious distress, that Mr Fairfax thought this forced sexual act was consensual,” Ms Tyson said in the statement, which was published by multiple US media outlets.The same website that disclosed Mr Northam’s yearbook photo was the first to report Ms Tyson’s allegations on Monday.RespectAfter she came forward, Mr Fairfax again denied wrongdoing but asked that she be treated with respect. “But I cannot agree with a description of events that I know is not true,” he said in a statement.Elected officials in both parties have recently seen their careers ended by allegations of racism and sexual misconduct.Florida’s Republican secretary of state last month resigned after a newspaper published a photo of him wearing blackface at a 2005 costume party.Democratic US senator Al Franken resigned in 2017 after being accused of sexual misconduct.Attorney general Mr Herring said in a statement on Wednesday he now realised he showed poor judgement by dressing as a rapper and donning a wig and brown make-up to perform a song with similarly attired friends.“I had a callous and inexcusable lack of awareness and insensitivity to the pain my behaviour could inflict on others,” he said. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

A vote is due on Friday.Crucially, this would prevent Gazprom, the Russian state-owned energy company, from remaining the pipeline\u0027s majority shareholder.Germany has been building a blocking minority to stop the move, but it was depending on France’s support.“Work is continuing with our partners, in particular with Germany, on possible changes to the text,” a French foreign ministry spokesman told a press conference.But Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper quoted unnamed French government sources as being more direct: “We do not want to increase our dependency on Russia and harm the interests of EU countries like Poland and Slovakia”.Russian gas supplies to Western EuropeMr Macron and Mrs Merkel have been keen to promote their personal friendship as a renewal of the Franco-German alliance at the heart of the EU.But despite the smiles for the cameras at last month’s treaty signing in Aachen, Mr Macron is believed to be unhappy with the very limited support Mrs Merkel has given to his proposals for EU reform.France\u0027s announcement came as Mr Macron cancelled plans to travel to this weekend’s Munich Security Conference, at which he was expected to meet with Mrs Merkel.The Elysee Palace said he was cancelling all international travel to concentrate on the situation in France, where his government has faced protests by the Gilets Jaunes movement.Please review our commenting policyRetired accountant who took his own life at Dignitas urges MPs to change the law on assisted dyingRussell Group university outreach programmes flounder as half admit fewer state school students than previous yearJay-Z hires lawyer for British rapper 21 Savage over \u0026#39absolute travesty\u0026#39 deportation threatJewish Labour MP faces calls for deselection following criticism of Jeremy Corbyn over anti-SemitismBrexit latest news: UK and EU locked in Brexit stalemate after Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker refuse to budge in crunch talks Comment: Want to make childcare more affordable for everyone?

This is clear-cut proof that there is a HUGE lack of ersity at Gucci.”The polo neck was described as “a racist golliwog image”, with one Twitter user remarking: “Jesus Christ. Who actually thought that this would be a good idea?”But others said the criticism was an over-reaction. “The only offensive thing about this is the price. I suppose balaclavas are all racist now, too,” was one typical remark.In a statement, Gucci said: “We deeply apologise for the offence caused by the wool balaclava jumper. We confirm that the item has been immediately removed from our online store and all physical stores.We are fully committed to increasing ersity throughout our organisation and turning this incident into a powerful learning moment for the Gucci team and beyond.”D\u0026ampG caused offence three years ago when they released an item of footwear that they called a slave sandal.Amid an outcry, the company changed the name of the shoe to “decorative flat sandal”.Gucci is the third Italian fashion house to be accused of peddling racist stereotypes in the last few months.In December, Prada was forced to withdraw a line of “Sambo-like” figurines and key rings that featured monkey-like characters with big red lips.Critics said Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana\u0026#39s advertising campaign was racist and played on stereotypes of Chinese womenThe company issued an apology, saying that the resemblance of the products to blackface was by no means intentional.”“First Prada, now Gucci. Shouldn’t it be quite easy for major fashion houses to avoid producing items that look like racist tropes? Why does this keep happening?” one woman commented on social media.In November, Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana had to apologise for an online ad campaign which featured a Chinese model struggling to eat Italian dishes such as spaghetti and pizza with a pair of chopsticks.The model laughed and giggled apologetically, in a depiction which was criticised as a negative and outdated stereotyping of Chinese women.The advertisement prompted fury from many Chinese and the fashion house had to cancel a fashion show in Shanghai.Chinese retailers withdrew D\u0026ampG products from their shops and websites, while some celebrities publicly criticised the brand.The row was reignited when Stefano Gabbana, co-founder of the fashion house, posted a smiling poo emoji on his private Instagram account and referred to China as “a country of shit”.The company insisted that his account had been maliciously hacked.Last month, the model who appeared in the advertising campaign said it had almost wrecked her career.“I feel guilty for causing the disturbance,” said Zuo Ye. “I never expected that this one time would almost ruin my model career.”Promising that she would “grow from this experience”, she said she was mortified to have been accused of deriding Chinese women.It is not just Italian brands that have been accused of racism and prejudice.In 2011 John Galliano, the British designer, was sacked as creative director of Dior, the French fashion house, after hurling anti-Semitic and racist insults at a couple dining in a brasserie in Paris.He later blamed his addiction to drugs and alcohol for the tirade and said he had no recollection of what he had said.Russell Group university outreach programmes flounder as half admit fewer state school students than previous yearJay-Z hires lawyer for British rapper 21 Savage over \u0026#39absolute travesty\u0026#39 deportation threatJewish Labour MP faces calls for deselection following criticism of Jeremy Corbyn over anti-SemitismBrexit latest news: UK and EU locked in Brexit stalemate after Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker refuse to budge in crunch talks Comment: Want to make childcare more affordable for everyone?

It\u0027s probably better you did not succeed in getting the job because you can never be late for or miss work at our business. Ever.We are British, but generally cannot ever manage to hire British due to poor work ethics.Intenso Espresso in Hove, East SussexThe Trades Union Congress has condemned his attitude and defended British workers, who the organisation claims put in some of the longest hours in Europe.Ms Atkins from Brighton, East Sussex, said: He is very rude and nasty.I\u0027d had a really bad morning and just asked if I could rebook the trial shift.I\u0027d taken the bus and left plenty of time, but due to delays I soon realised I would be late.By this time I was soaking wet because the bus only went half way, and my friend lives on the same road as the cafe so I went there to shower and dry off.I was already a couple of hours late so asked if I could go at a later date, which is when he said no.Don\u0027t get me wrong, I understand why he didn\u0027t let me just do another shift, but his comments about British people having no work ethic were shocking.She added that the comment about eating bacon left her very, very offended.Mr Preston-Powers defended  his remarks. He said: Our experience of running a small, private, family-run coffee shop in Hove is that the very poorest type of employee is a British one. Full stop.The last candidate you want to take on - and we try ardently to hire everyone - is British.It is true, comprehensively, that every single one of the British employees that we\u0027ve had will call in and have some issues, or be late. But when you have someone who comes from a country where there are no jobs and appreciate they have a job, they work every single hour.It\u0027s just a preference and making it very clear and being honest about what genre of people have the best work ethic.A TUC spokesperson said: If he\u0027s looking for the title of Britain\u0027s Worst Boss, it sounds like he\u0027s going about it the right way.It\u0027s illegal to discriminate against job applicants based on their ethnicity. Britain\u0027s workers have a very strong work ethic.

The company also plans to increase the help it provides for self-harmers who used Instagram to share their experience.The move follows the death of Molly, 14, who took her life after viewing self-harm images. Her father, Ian, said Instagram “helped kill my daughter.”The announcement came as Mr Mosseri this afternoon met with Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, who last week warned social media firms they could be banned if they failed to remove harmful material.Duty of Care campaign | Read moreEarlier, the Instagram boss had met with Jeremy Wright, the Culture Secretary, who is due to publish in the next month his plans for new laws to regulate social media.It is expected to include plans for a regulator with powers to force social media companies to take down illegal material such as violence and child abuse within fixed time periods and to purge harmful but legal content such as cyberbullying and self-harm imagery.Mosseri has met with Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, who last week warned social media firms they could be banned if they failed to remove harmful materialThe Daily  has been campaigning for a statutory duty of care to protect children from online harms.Asked why it had taken Instagram so long to tackle self-harm and to act only after the publicity surrounding Molly’s death, Mr Mosseri said: “We have not been as focused as we should have been on the effects of graphic imagery of anyone looking at content.“That is something that we are looking to correct and correct quickly. It’s unfortunate it took the last few weeks for us to realise that. It’s now our responsibility to address that issue as quickly as we can.”He said the ban on graphic self harm would be introduced as “quickly and responsibly” as the company could.He pointed out that by allowing people to post content Instagram had helped save lives, by, for example, enabling friends to alert law enforcement agencies if someone was about to seriously harm themselves.“I do want to be careful because there is a tension between wanting to act and act quickly and need to act responsibly,” he told The Daily .“For instance I don’t want to do anything that will unintentionally stigmatise any sort of mental health issues. I don’t want to do anything that will put a vulnerable person in a place where they feel unsupported or ashamed if we take that content down.“There is a tension between speed and responsibility.

That forecast in the bank’s latest Inflation Report is down sharply from the 1.7 per cent growth it estimated in November and would be the feeblest performance since GDP plummeted by 1.4 per cent in 2009.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIt also sees a roughly one in four probability of a recession in the second half of 2019.\u0026nbsp“This slowdown mainly reflects softer activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home,” said the bank, admitting that business investment had been considerably weaker than it previously anticipated due to fears over a Brexit cliff-edge for trade.Yet the bank stressed that even this much weaker outlook was conditioned on a “smooth adjustment” to life outside the EU. Last December it published stress-test scenario for banks in which a no-deal Brexit could plunge Britain into the worst recession since the 1920s, with GDP collapsing by 8 per cent.Speaking at the Bank\u0027s press conference the Governor, Mark Carney, said the risk of the UK crashing out of the EU had gone up.\u0026nbspI would have described no-deal, no transition a few years ago as a low probability event.

Now it expects a fall of 2.75 per cent. Its 2020 forecast is also slashed from 5 per cent to 2.75 per cent.As expected by markets, the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent. The markets are currently pricing in no rate hike until the middle of 2020. In December they had priced in one quarter-point increase in 2019 and another in 2020. With the bank’s inflation forecast broadly unchanged by the end of the forecast period from November, anticipated at\u0026nbsp 2.1 per cent in Q1 2021, markets are likely to take the latest inflation projections as a signal that the MPC is in no hurry to raise rates.The bank’s 2020 GDP growth rate is also reduced to 1.5 per cent, down from 1.7 per cent previously, although it has pencilled in a recovery to 1.9 per cent in 2021 if Brexit is smooth and the UK is safely in the transition period.Emphasising how much damage Brexit has already done to business investment, which accounts for around 10 per cent of UK GDP, the bank noted that the post-2008 recovery in firms’ spending had “stalled” since the 2015 referendum act was passed.Brexit impact on investment“The Bank has today put a major health warning on the UK economy as ongoing Brexit uncertainty and weaker global growth combine. Such a slowdown, should it materialise, is not just about abstract GDP figures but slower earnings and income growth for households all over the country, said\u0026nbspJames Smith of the the Resolution Foundation:“Today’s report should remind politicians across parliament that the stalemated Brexit process comes with a very real price tag.”The bank also published some modelling which suggests that if uncertainty fell and financial conditions across the economy improved, UK GDP growth could be lifted to 1.6 per cent this year and 2.2 per cent in 2020.The latest report from the bank’s network of regional agents relates that around half of the 200 firms questioned said they are “not ready” for a no-deal Brexit, even though most had a contingency plan in place.In the near term, the bank expects growth in the final quarter of 2018 to have been 0.3 per cent and to decline to 0.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2019. This opens around a small amount of slack (0.25 per cent of GDP) in the economy, according to the bank.The bank reiterated its warning that, in the wake of no-deal Brexit, interest rates could move in either direction, depending on MPC estimates of the extent of damage to demand and supply, although many analysts think that the bank would be more likely to cut rates to support spending in such circumstances.“The economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature of the EU withdrawal,” said the bank. “In particular: the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom, whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth, and how households, businesses and financial markets respond.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Hazel Sheffield reportsClick to followThe IndependentBrian Kavanagh had been a butcher in Glasgow for more than 20 years when one night, everything changed.His wife, a committed vegan, showed him the film Earthlings, a 2005 documentary narrated by Joaquin Phoenix about the suffering endured by animals at factory farms and research labs.\u0026nbsp“The next morning I went into work and nothing felt right,” Kavanagh says.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Suddenly the idea of putting something dead inside my body didn’t feel right.”Kavanagh was working as a manager on the meat counter at Morrisons. He had a\u0026nbspyoung family and bills to pay. He kept his feelings to himself. But going into work became harder each day.McDonald’s Sweden launches ‘McFalafel’ as first vegan Happy MealThese are the most common misconceptions about vegansWhat it’s like to stay in the world’s first vegan hotel suiteEventually he found work at a small pizza chain. When that closed down the owner of the business introduced him to Hilary Masin and Alberto Casotto, the founders of a vegan meat company called Sgaia’s Vegan Meats.Since 2017, Kavanagh has been working with the firm\u0026nbspat its Glasgow base, producing vegan meat for its\u0026nbspsuppliers and working on new recipes to meet demand. “I am a lot happier – it’s like night and day,” Kavanagh says.\u0026nbspSgaia’s is one of a rising number of food manufacturers branding their products not as vegan alternatives, but as a radical new type of meat. The size of the market for alternatives is still tiny compared with the global meat market, but there are signs the meat industry is watching closely.\u0026nbspIn the US, the beef industry has filed a petition to exclude non-animal products from the definition of meat, while the French have passed a law banning vegetarian companies from calling their products sausages, mince or bacon.\u0026nbspWhen Sean Monson, the producer of Earthlings, co-produced another film about animal rights abuses in 2018 called Dominion, groups in the meat sector reacted angrily. Patrick Hutchinson, the chief executive of the Australian Meat Industry Council, said the film was an “upsetting” representation of the industry. “What the film shows is not representative of the practices of the wider industry,” Hutchinson says. “The vast majority of their employees are deeply committed to ensuring the most humane experience possible for animals.”But Kavanagh says that even as a butcher, he was shielded from the worst practices in the industry. He got into the trade at 16 after seeing a job with a family-run shop advertised at the job centre. “When the first meat van came in, it had the first quarter of a pig with the head still on. I remember thinking I was going to throw up, but you just kind of get used to it,” he says. He stayed with the family butcher and moved on to Morrisons when it closed down, clocking 20 years in the trade.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Creative dishes by vegan YouTubers - In pictures  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Vegan beer and cheddar bread bowl dipTortilla soup and cheesy taquitosVegan beer and cheddar bread bowl dipTortilla soup and cheesy taquitosAt Sgaia’s, Kavanagh is in charge of running the kitchen, keeping up with orders and experimenting with new recipes. He has just developed a square sausage recipe using similar spices he used to use in meat sausages, but switching out the animal protein for gluten and soy.\u0026nbspNext, the company is working on vegan black pudding to add to its growing range of vegan burgers, bacon, pepperoni slices and even steak. “It’s been interesting to use my knowledge for something different,” he says. “The meat all gets sliced the same way in a meat slicer, which I have been using for more than a decade, and after all that practise with sausages, I am pretty fast with a knife.”Founders Masin and Casotto, who both have Italian heritage, started making vegan meat from their home kitchen in Wales in 2013. “We’re really into making food,” Masin says. “After we turned vegan we tried to make salamino for our pizza, which is a kind of ham, and then it became more and more like a challenge to research the way these meats are cured and stored.”\u0026nbspThe business partners started to sell their products at festivals and markets, which led to enquiries from shops and cafes. Masin still remembers the panic when they got the first 14 orders through their website, before they knew how to pack the products and ship them out. “I was studying at university at the time and Aberto called me and said, ‘We can’t do this, it’s too much.’”12 best vegan shoes for womenAfter sell-out appearances at vegan festivals, Sgaia’s moved to Glasgow where it has been supported by a small business growth grant from Paisley Council to take on a catering kitchen and office space. In January, the company sold 5,000 units and 500kg of fake meat products through a handful of ethical suppliers, including Suma, Marigold Health Foods and Greencity Wholefoods, and the company website, which reads: “We don’t make fake meats: they are real, just vegan.”Many vegan meat or food technology companies are trying to get their products stocked in the meat aisles at supermarkets, where environmentally-conscious customers will be confronted with the dilemma of which product to buy. In the US, Beyond Meat has created a burger made principally of yellow pea protein that mimics the texture and taste of meat, with the intention that supermarkets sell the product alongside animal protein. In July, Sainsbury’s trialled stocking plant-based products in refrigerators alongside slaughtered meat.\u0026nbspMasin says the barrier for smaller competitors such as\u0026nbspSgaia’s\u0026nbspis not where plant-based products are stocked, but how hard it is to comply with complex safety rules and to produce at scale. “We’ve been contacted by the major retailers, but because we’re so small it’s difficult for them to work with us,” Masin says. “When the quantity is there, we will look at it.”After two decades in the meat industry, Kavanagh is enjoying working with a much smaller company. He mostly keeps his veganism to himself, apart from when he is manning the pop-up kitchen at vegan festivals, where customers are amazed by his butcher past: “If you’re working for a supermarket, it’s all about profits, basically – whereas this is about making a difference.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That forecast in the bank’s latest Inflation Report is down sharply from the 1.7 per cent growth it estimated in November and would be the feeblest performance since GDP plummeted by 1.4 per cent in 2009.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIt also sees a roughly one in four probability of a recession in the second half of 2019.\u0026nbsp“This slowdown mainly reflects softer activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home,” said the bank, admitting that business investment had been considerably weaker than it previously anticipated due to fears over a Brexit cliff-edge for trade.Yet the bank stressed that even this much weaker outlook was conditioned on a “smooth adjustment” to life outside the EU. Last December it published stress-test scenario for banks in which a no-deal Brexit could plunge Britain into the worst recession since the 1920s, with GDP collapsing by 8 per cent.Speaking at the Bank\u0027s press conference the Governor, Mark Carney, said the risk of the UK crashing out of the EU had gone up.\u0026nbspI would have described no-deal, no transition a few years ago as a low probability event. I would describe it now as not the central scenario. In other words...the probability has gone up, he said.We\u0027re seven weeks before Brexit date and the range of potential outcomes is very wide.

Now it expects a fall of 2.75 per cent. Its 2020 forecast is also slashed from 5 per cent to 2.75 per cent.As expected by markets, the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent. The markets are currently pricing in no rate hike until the middle of 2020. In December they had priced in one quarter-point increase in 2019 and another in 2020. With the bank’s inflation forecast broadly unchanged by the end of the forecast period from November, anticipated at\u0026nbsp 2.1 per cent in Q1 2021, markets are likely to take the latest inflation projections as a signal that the MPC is in no hurry to raise rates.The bank’s 2020 GDP growth rate is also reduced to 1.5 per cent, down from 1.7 per cent previously, although it has pencilled in a recovery to 1.9 per cent in 2021 if Brexit is smooth and the UK is safely in the transition period.Emphasising how much damage Brexit has already done to business investment, which accounts for around 10 per cent of UK GDP, the bank noted that the post-2008 recovery in firms’ spending had “stalled” since the 2015 referendum act was passed.Brexit impact on investment“The Bank has today put a major health warning on the UK economy as ongoing Brexit uncertainty and weaker global growth combine. Such a slowdown, should it materialise, is not just about abstract GDP figures but slower earnings and income growth for households all over the country, said\u0026nbspJames Smith of the the Resolution Foundation:“Today’s report should remind politicians across parliament that the stalemated Brexit process comes with a very real price tag.”The bank also published some modelling which suggests that if uncertainty fell and financial conditions across the economy improved, UK GDP growth could be lifted to 1.6 per cent this year and 2.2 per cent in 2020.The latest report from the bank’s network of regional agents relates that around half of the 200 firms questioned said they are “not ready” for a no-deal Brexit, even though most had a contingency plan in place.In the near term, the bank expects growth in the final quarter of 2018 to have been 0.3 per cent and to decline to 0.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2019. This opens around a small amount of slack (0.25 per cent of GDP) in the economy, according to the bank.The bank reiterated its warning that, in the wake of no-deal Brexit, interest rates could move in either direction, depending on MPC estimates of the extent of damage to demand and supply, although many analysts think that the bank would be more likely to cut rates to support spending in such circumstances.“The economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature of the EU withdrawal,” said the bank. “In particular: the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom, whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth, and how households, businesses and financial markets respond.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And yet in fifteen institutions, the proportion of public school pupils is more than 30 per cent, the figures show. \u0026nbspIn this group, which is dominated by small specialist institutions and Russell Group universities, the proportion of state school pupils is as low as 31.1 per cent (the Royal College of Music).Among the Russell Group universities which saw drops were Exeter (a fall of 3.5 percentage points), Imperial College (a fall of 1.9 percentage points) and Durham (a fall of 1.6 percentage points).Oxford and Cambridge were among the institutions with the lowest proportions of state school pupils – 58.2 per cent and 63.4 per cent respectively – but their figures improved on previous years.\u0026nbspThe figures from HESA also revealed a 0.2 percentage point rise in the proportion of students from areas of high disadvantage where there has traditionally been low participation rates at university.But still the proportion of students from these neighbourhoods is only 11.6 per cent. And at King’s College London, it is as low as 3.8 per cent, which is a 1 percentage point drop on last year.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It is clear that universities and the government need to do more to widen access to higher education. These figures suggest that progress in this direction has stalled.“The proportion of state school pupils at some universities is significantly out of kilter with the fact that the vast majority of young people attend these schools, including many young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.”Cambridge University given record £100m donation from billionaireSir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust, said: “Despite the progress on widening participation made by many universities in the past few years, it is disheartening to still see no significant increase in the numbers of students entering universities from state schools.“This report highlights again the need for concerted action by universities and government alike. We need to see a renewed focus on widening participation so that all young people have a fair chance of getting into university, particularly the most selective ones.”He added that poorer students should be given “a break” through contextual admissions.Sarah Stevens, head of policy at the Russell Group, said: “Overall the proportion of state school pupils entering Russell Group universities has remained steady, accounting for around four out of every five students.“Looking across the Russell Group, the proportion of disadvantaged students is also slightly up.“But where inidual universities have seen dips, they will of course take it seriously and we all want to see further progress.”A Universities UK spokesperson said: “Eighteen year olds from the most disadvantaged areas in England are more likely to go to university than ever before, but we know that a number of challenges remain. We are supporting universities in their efforts to build on work that has increased the number of students from erse backgrounds in recent years.”The organisation called on the government’s post-18 education review to make recommendations that support widening access – including targeted maintenance grants for those most in need.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As anyone who has worked on plumbing in their own home knows, these types of things sometimes happen, a NASA spokesperson said.Flight controllers evaluated the module\u0027s systems and didn\u0027t find any damage after the water was cleaned up. Astronauts then finished installing the new double stall enclosure in preparation for a new toilet system to be delivered to the space station in 2020.In December, the ISS crew was forced to deal with a mysterious hole that appeared on the outside of the orbiting lab.One member of the crew suggested the strange gap was caused by someone drilling a hole in the space station from the inside.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

William Cook travels to Brussels to meet the famous duo, who have\u0026nbspturned their lives together into a perpetual, seamless artworkClick to followThe IndependentGilbert and George outside their house in Spitalfields: ‘We really believe that Fournier Street is the centre of the world for us’In a dilapidated old arsenal on the industrial edge of Brussels, Gilbert and George are singing the music hall song that made them famous. Their audience seem a bit bemused, and who on earth can blame them? “Underneath the Arches” is as British as warm\u0026nbspbeer or test match cricket, and equally incomprehensible to European punters. First performed by a very different duo, Flanagan and Allen, way back in the 1930s, it was already a golden oldie when Gilbert and George started singing it in art galleries 50 years ago.Half a century later, it’s become the theme tune for their lifelong career as Living Sculptures. No wonder these continental liggers are nonplussed. To anyone who isn’t steeped in British culture, with its weird passion for nostalgia, Gilbert and George must seem very odd indeed. “We never wanted to be weird because all artists like the idea of being weird, and we never wanted to be normal because everybody’s normal,” says George, by way of explanation. “We like to be weird and normal at the same time.”Gilbert and George are here in Brussels to open Brafa, one of Europe’s most prestigious art fairs. Each year, a famous artist is invited to be Brafa’s guest of honour. Last year, it was Christo. This year, it’s Gilbert and George. Their big bold artworks are scattered around this huge hall, an incongruous contrast to the antique paintings that surround them.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThis juxtaposition is surreal – and here in the Belgian capital, the city of Magritte, that’s really rather fitting. For Brexit-obsessed Britons, Brussels may be synonymous with the European Union, but for Europeans it’s always been synonymous with surrealism – and what could possibly be more surreal than Gilbert and George?Despite their matching suits, and shirts and ties, they’re easy to tell apart. George looks like Eric Morecambe. Gilbert looks like Ernie Wise. However, unlike Eric and Ernie, they’re more than just a double act. They live together, they work together, they always appear in public together. This has been their way of life since they met, in London, in 1967, at St Martin’s School of Art (now Central Saint Martins). Their artworks are striking, and often bizarrely beautiful, but they’re a sideshow compared to their greatest work of art: themselves.Created with Sketch.Gilbert and George: portraits and works Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gilbert and George in their local cafe in Spitalfields, 2017Gilbert and George outside of their favourite restaurant, Mangal II, a Kurdish restaurant in Stoke Newington 2017 Portrait of Gilbert and George RA after receiving their medals at the Royal Academy of Arts on May 2, 2017Portrait of Gilbert and George RA after receiving their medals at the Royal Academy of Arts on May 2, 2017Gilbert and George, 2015Gilbert and George in their younger yearsGilbert and George - SFG (2013)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - HANDBALL (2008)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - TEACHER STRAIGHT (2011)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - BEARD RAIDS (2016) Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - BEARD MAD (2016)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George, 2017Early morning.

Everyone assumes so, but no one seems to know for sure, and their public life is far more intriguing than whatever they might get up to in private. Young men feature prominently in their work, women are conspicuous by their absence, but you wouldn’t call these pictures homoerotic. Indeed, there’s something strangely sexless about them, like artworks from another planet.Their\u0026nbspDirty Words\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspNaked Shit\u0026nbsppictures caused a predictable furore (the titles are self-explanatory) but most of their work isn’t overtly controversial. The most radical thing about them isn’t their art, but the way they’ve merged their inidual identities into one.‘Fake’ Hitler paintings seized by German police in BerlinThey’re reluctant to discuss the details of their lives before they met, but their backgrounds are fascinating. When pressed, they stress the similarities – they were both war babies from provincial, lower-class, unartistic families – but the differences are far more notable, and the most notable difference is that one half of this very British duo wasn’t originally British at all.Gilbert Prousch was born in a small village in the Italian Dolomites in 1943. His father was a shoemaker, like his grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great grandfather before him, but after the war mass-produced shoes became much cheaper and so Gilbert’s father struggled to make a living. Inspired by Michaelangelo, Gilbert studied art in Salzburg and then in Munich, where he heard about St Martin’s. He travelled to London and wangled a place on its internationally renowned advanced sculpture course. He didn’t speak a word of English. He still speaks with a strong Italian accent today.George Passmore, conversely, speaks like a BBC newsreader from the 1950s. He was born in Devon in 1942. His father left home soon after George was born, possibly before. His mother was uninhibited, and George had a succession of “uncles”, which must have exposed him to gossip in postwar Totnes. At state school he showed a talent for art, which eventually won him a place at Dartington Hall, a private school renowned for its progressive attitudes. Inspired by Van Gogh’s letters, he went on to art school, and ended up at St Martin’s, on the advanced sculpture course, with Gilbert Prousch.“George took an interest in me,” says Gilbert. They became friends – and then lovers? Last time I met them, in their home in London, I asked them if it was love at first sight. “No,” said George. He described their relationship as something that happened gradually, “like an atmosphere or a cloud”. Do they ever wonder what might have happened if they’d never met? The idea clearly seems inconceivable to them. They believe they were destined to be together. “It was fate,” says Gilbert.The sculpture course at St Martin’s was (in)famously laissez-faire. Students could do whatever they wanted, which suited Gilbert and George just fine. “St Martin’s was the best art school in the world,” says Gilbert. “This was a school that said to an artist, ‘Anything goes. You are free to think in different ways.’ No other art school did that.” His art training in Munich had been traditional and academic. “St Martin’s was different – anything could be art.”Their fellow students included Barry Flanagan, Bruce McLean and, most notably, Richard Long, who turned walking into an artform. Gilbert and George went even further. They turned their lives together into a perpetual, seamless artwork. As Gilbert says, “We were the centre of our art.”While Long set off into the wilderness, Gilbert and George wandered around London’s East End. It was here, in a Dickensian junk shop, that they found an old record of “Underneath the Arches”, and came up with the idea of singing along to it, for hours and hours on end. They called this artwork The Singing Sculpture. “We felt we were doing something different,” says Gilbert. Like all the best ideas, it was both in keeping with, yet contrary to, the spirit of the times. Conceptual art was all the rage, but most of it was terribly earnest. Their Singing Sculpture was full of fun.Brafa, one of Europe’s most prestigious art fairs\u0026nbsp(Fabrice Debatty)“For the artists who were showing in those galleries, colour was taboo, figuration was taboo, sex was taboo, feeling was taboo – and these were all of the things we were interested in,” says George. Other artists got drunk in the evening, then went back into the studio in the morning to make sombre, sober art. Gilbert and George turned their drunken revels into art.They couldn’t get any public subsidy, and they had no family money to support them. Looking back, they now believe this gave them an advantage. “We could feel more free – we didn’t have to fit in in any way,” says George. “Middle-class people are more constrained.”They got their big break at a group show in London called When Attitudes Become Form. When the curator declined to include their work they gatecrashed the private view, and stole the show with their Living Sculptures, standing in the middle of the gallery like showroom dummies. Konrad Fischer saw them at this show, and asked them to perform in Düsseldorf. In Düsseldorf they were seen by Illeana Sonnabend, who invited them to New York. Fischer and Sonnabend were two of the world’s most influential art dealers. Gilbert and George had arrived.Around the same time they moved into a Georgian townhouse in Fournier Street, in London’s Spitalfields. They’ve lived there ever since. It was a poor area when they moved in. It’s got a lot smarter since, but it’s still a tough old place. The tramps that used to live there have been replaced by drug addicts, but they don’t mind this shifting cityscape – they embrace it. “We are very optimistic people,” says George. “We are never against anything.”Like a lot of their boldest statements, this is only partly true. They were certainly against the artistic orthodoxy of the 1960s and 1970s. In their suits and ties and starched white shirts they stood out a mile. “To be an artist you had to be critical. You had to be against the bomb, or against America, or against the Conservatives or against Labour,” says George. “We thought, ‘How marvellous it would be if we didn’t have to be Anti!’” It’s a philosophy they maintain when people bring petitions to their front door. “If it’s for something, we sign it. If it’s against something, we don’t sign it. We must have signed for some horrible things, but at least we were for.”Living in Spitalfields has been absolutely central to their art. “We really believe that Fournier Street is the centre of the world for us,” Gilbert tells me. “It’s an amazing mixture of different kinds of people.” Spitalfields has long been a refuge for arriving immigrants: Huguenots, Jews, Sikhs, Muslims… “The East End of London is a mixture of so many countries, a mixture of so many different people.” This is just the way they like it. “You face the modern world whenever you step out of the front door,” says George.They’ve exhibited all around the world, but though their pictures attract a lot of interest, wherever they go the main attraction is always Gilbert and George. It’s the same story here in Brussels. It’s like attending a press conference with Quentin Crisp and Oscar Wilde. Sure, it’s the same show every time, more or less, endless variations on a single theme, but it’s still more entertaining and enlightening than talking to any other artists I can think of.They set off for a walk around Brafa, followed by a swarm of hacks. “Our motto is ban religion,” says Gilbert, as they pause for photos in front of one of their monumental pictures. Religion loomed large in both their childhoods: Gilbert was raised a Catholic George’s brother became a vicar. Their artworks are oddly reminiscent of stained glass windows, but they’re both devout atheists. “We don’t believe in God,” says Gilbert. “All the gods are manmade. We are in charge of what we are doing in this world.”“We’ve always firmly believed that the national galleries of the world should remove all of the Christian art and hand it back to the Church,” says George. “They can look after the insurance and maintenance and conservation, and give over the national museums to humanist art, not Judeo-Christian voodoo.” George tells a story about an elderly vicar who knocked on their front door. “I thought it was marvellous that you said Ban Religion,” he told them. “My congregation come to church every week, and they’re all very religious. But I don’t want them to be religious. I want them to be good.”“We believe in the enlightenment, when people became human for their own sake,” adds Gilbert. “They didn’t need God anymore to make themselves human.” Their heroes are Charles Darwin and Alan Turing.We stop in front of a montage they made from tabloid posters, which they stole from outside newsagents. “It’s not a very easy thing to do because the shopkeepers don’t like you to do that, so one of us would go into the shop to distract the shopkeeper while the other stole the poster,” confesses George. “After three and a half years we ended up with more than 3,700 posters, and then we ided them into subjects – the ones which said Rape, the ones that said Murder, the ones that said Mugged, and ended up with a very big group of pictures.” They only got caught once. “We were very polite and gave it back to the shop, but we went the next night and stole it again.”‘Honest posters’ take down this year’s Oscar nomineesMan mistaken for employee strolls out of art gallery with $1m paintingThe rise of graphic novels, from To Kill a Mockingbird to SabrinaDespite these rebellious attitudes, they’re reassuringly old-fashioned. They don’t use the internet, or mobile phones. The only time they use the telephone is to book a table at the local restaurant where they’ve eaten for the past 20 years. After 50 years in the spotlight, they still maintain they’re outside the art establishment.Maybe they were, once upon a time (when they met, in 1967, homosexuality had only just been decriminalised) but that time has long since passed. Today they’re Royal Academicians who’ve exhibited in virtually every major gallery across the globe. If they were ever anti-establishment, the establishment has long since absorbed them. Yet for all their success there’s still something discreetly anarchic about them, a hint of danger behind their impeccable manners and immaculately tailored suits.They’re now lionised by the art world, but they don’t like hobnobbing with other artists. “We had friends in London, Paris, Germany, New York, a huge group of friends – drinking, celebrating, parties – and then one day we cut it off, we stopped,” says George. “We realised it was all to do with gossip and business – the nightmare of a world that has nothing to do with being an artist.” “We wanted to be free of gossiping,” says Gilbert. “We have friends, but we don’t want artist friends.” Though the art world has appropriated them, and sanctified them, they’re still outsiders at heart.So what advice would they give to an aspiring young artist starting out today? “Tomorrow morning, when you wake up, sit on the edge of your bed, keep your eyes closed, and don’t open them and stand up until you have decided, ‘What do I want to say to the world today?’” says George.

(I agree that your game is the world’s game never mind that our “Super Bowl” winners declare themselves “world champions.”)The “firsts” did not end there. It was my first match outside the United States my first trip to Manchester even my first press pass. (I’m an academic.)For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIt’s fitting that all my “firsts” have taken place in this city of firsts.My time in Manchester has had the markings and feel of a pilgrimage. So many great contributions to humanity were born here, in the world’s first modern industrial city. The first passenger railway.\u0026nbspI took a train from London to get here! The first professional football league. I visited the national football museum! The first hipster reclaiming of gritty industrial city spaces in pursuit of authenticity. I passed by a group of men shooting up under a railway bridge along the canal path during my morning run!This World Cup shows how far women in football have comeThis felt like a trip to mecca because I was born and raised a football lover. Both footballs. In the United States, girls play soccer – maybe even more than boys – and from the time I could walk I craved to run free in fields and play games. In soccer, I relished the sensations of movement and power, playing midfield, running everywhere on the pitch.\u0026nbspI also grew up a die-hard American college football fan, worshipping in Michigan Stadium, a place we lovingly call “the Big House.” (Capacity is officially 107, 601, but we’ve been known to cram in upwards of 115,000.)For years I watched every game and participated in all the home game rituals and traditions with my dad, who was and still is a season ticketholder with the Wolverines. We always arrived early to watch teams warm up, listen to the PA announcer perform his introductory script, and cheer the team as they took the field, players jumping to tap the “M Club Supports You” banner at midfield.Created with Sketch.Your First Football Shirt: a collection of famous football memories Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Alan Shearer, Lucy Bronze, Dwight Yorke and other footballers and famous fans discuss their first football shirt as well as some of their fondest football memories231 Andrei Kanchelskis winning the 1990 European Under 21 Championship for the Soviet UnionAndrei Kanchelskis: In my mind, winning a trophy for your country at any level is one of the greatest accolades.”331 Dwight Yorke on winning the treble for Manchester United in 1999Dwight Yorke: “Winning the treble with Manchester United will always be my favourite achievement in football.”431 Graeme Le Saux on scoring for England v BrazilGraeme Le Saux: Scoring against Brazil is definitely up there531 Alan Shearer on breaking Newcastle United’s goal scoring recordAlan Shearer: “I can’t describe the feeling.

In the 1990s I sat in the stands when Tom Brady – whose New England Patriots just won their sixth Super Bowl – was not the Tom Brady we know today, but was second, even third-string, backing up other future NFL quarterbacks at Michigan.If Brits think their families’ and communities’ commitments to football clubs are more authentic than Americans’ because they go back further, they are looking to the wrong league and teams. Our connections and century-long traditions are not found in the NFL, but, rather, with our college football programs that – like your links to British football clubs – go back to the nineteenth century.Patrice Evra sparks backlash for ‘patronising’ applauding of Eni AlukoAnd our rivalries are just as fierce. Michigan’s rival of more than 100 years standing is The Ohio State University: my mother is a graduate and serious fan. She can tell you all the reasons why OSU traditions surpass the Wolverines’, and how Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh is a beautiful 0-4 versus her Buckeyes. I learned from my mom that women are real, authentic fans too.Women play and follow football, many as seriously as men. But I experienced another first in Manchester. This was also my first experience in a traditionally male workplace that was still almost entirely, unapologetically, male. The only other women I saw in the press areas were serving food or working on the social media and communications teams for Man City and Arsenal. Pep Guardiola was so surprised to see a woman in the press room post-match that, when we made eye contact, his look of shock was priceless.I get it because I’m a historian. This is your “manly” sport. In the United States, our “manly” sports, historically, also happen to be our most insular and quintessentially American sports: baseball and American football. So while they may not translate neatly, I realise we have similar man-zone problems. In my lifetime, both our countries have worked to improve ersity and inclusion in sports participation and sports industries. We both have a long way to go.For all the claims of inclusivity and ersity that I saw in the national football museum on Saturday, I did not see it reflected in the match coverage on Sunday.Here’s the thing. I know there are hundreds, thousands of women in the UK who grew up playing football, cheering for local teams. They know the game as intimately as men do. They write well. They’re clever and funny and bring unique perspectives to their descriptions and analyses of the game. So why weren’t they in the media area on Sunday, and why was Pep so surprised to see me?Created with Sketch.Male cheerleaders make history at 2019 Super Bowl  Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Inclusivity does not happen on its own. It requires ever-present work active, thoughtful decision-making by people in positions of leadership to commit to fundamental changes in their hiring practices, their mentoring cultures and professional growth opportunities, and their fostering of inclusive, healthy workplaces.\u0026nbspAfter all, the original construction of modern sport as a male domain was also man-made.\u0026nbsp(Ha.)I teach sports history at Arizona State University, and this semester I’m teaching a course on the history of baseball, or, rather, what baseball history tells us about American history.\u0026nbspHow multi-billion-dollar US college sports exploit their starsWe explore baseball’s critical role in both promoting and affirming an ideology of the supremacy of white men to hold positions of political, economic, and social authority, both within the United States and abroad.\u0026nbspThis was particularly so as the nineteenth century gave way to the twentieth when our country began to indulge its imperial ambitions beyond the North American continent. White men were fit to lead the world’s races, proving it through sporting prowess on the football gridiron and baseball diamond. This effort required pushing out people of African descent, and women, who had always been playing and loving baseball but now were forced to create their own separate – and often alternative or underground – teams and leagues to play in.When Jackie Robinson, who would have been 100 this year, desegregated Major League Baseball, joining the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, he inspired future generations of young people to stake their rightful claim to sporting spaces despite being told their identities disqualified them.\u0026nbspIdeas about who belongs – and who does not – do not stay in the sport space they leach out and influence ideas about “natural” ability and interest in broader society.Here in England, for 50 years, from 1921 to 1971, the Football Association banned women from football pitches, declaring “the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and should not be encouraged.” By no coincidence, this was at a time that women were gaining confidence both within and beyond sport, securing the right to the vote, enjoying public spaces, and demanding equal treatment in homes and workplaces.\u0026nbspWhat have I learned on my trip of firsts to the city of firsts? Sports hold incredible potential and power for social transformation. Sports are about people, and about bodies, and, most of all, they make us vulnerable. All of us. It’s in the space of vulnerability and strength and power and times of joy and times of pain that we hold the capacity and potential to see the humanity in each other.No matter the location on the planet, women athletes and sports professionals know that sports and politics have always mixed, because we’ve always had to fight so damn hard to play, to write about those who play, to coach and manage and take our seat in the boardroom. We won’t stop fighting to claim our right to play.

Rosalind the rover captures this spirit and carries us all to the forefront of space exploration.”Rosalind Franklin was central to the discovery of DNA, alongside\u0026nbspCrick and Watson, but her part in the work has been historically overlooked. She was not mentioned when Crick, Watson and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1962 for their work on DNA, and her name was left out of many science books until the 1990s – but in recent years there has been a major effort to recognise her part in the pioneering work.The lander has already had its landing site chosen ahead of its touchdown in 2021. The area is thought to have once been covered in a large lake, and scientists hope that signatures of life might be lying there.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightA new patent recently spotted by Patently Mobile suggests the S-Pen stylus is once again set for a major upgrade.Rather than simply being used to control the camera on the Galaxy Note smartphone, the stylus could soon come with its own integrated camera.Even more surprisingly, the camera could feature optical zoom, rather than simply digital zoom that has become a standard for most modern smartphones.Optical zoom capabilities are often shunned in favour of a slim device, though the length of the S-Pen means thickness is no longer an issue.The camera patent describes how the lens would fit into the upper chamber of the stylus.Something called a control key would then allow users to control the optical zooming feature.The patent was granted by the US Patent and Trademark Office on 5 February, having first been filed almost two years ago by the South Korean tech giant.While images show the stylus fitting into a smartphone, the patent notes that it could also be adapted to fit into laptop or desktop displays in the future.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Well beyond our galaxy, the Milky Way. Douglas Adams’\u0026nbspline from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy might well have been written especially to describe how far away they’re coming from: “I mean, you may think it’s a long way down the road to the chemist, but that’s just peanuts to space.”The Andromeda galaxy is 2.5 million light years from us the source of the FRBs detected by Chime\u0026nbspis a thousand times more distant than that.Before the project turned its hi-tech gaze on the heavens, there had been only one previously detected incident of a repeating FRB, and that was in 2012. “Knowing that there is another suggests that there could be more out there. And with more repeaters and more sources available for study, we may be able to understand these cosmic puzzles – where they’re from and what causes them,” says Ingrid Stairs, a member of the Chime team and an astrophysicist at UBC.The fact that scientists don’t know what is generating the FRBs raises the spectre that they are actually the work of some far-flung civilisation.The Seti (search for extraterrestrial intelligence) Institute in California is dedicated to finding evidence of alien life. Senior astronomer Seth Shostak wrote on the Seti website that FRBs in and of themselves weren’t necessarily cause for cracking open the champagne and laying out the interstellar welcome mat.Billions of stars across space turning into enormous crystals“It’s lore among astronomy grad students that cosmic phenomena are either singular – in other words, there’s only one in the universe – or they’re very common,” Shostak writes. “For example, some folks have argued that Earth might be unique. Maybe there’s only one such bio-friendly world in our galaxy, and we live on it.\u0026nbspBut a more frequently heard opinion is that, among the trillion planets of the Milky Way, there could be many billions that have spawned life.“When, a few years ago, only a handful of FRBs were known, it was unclear whether they were rare or otherwise. Now that more than 60 have been detected, researchers can safely say that there are probably thousands of these things going off every day. They are as ubiquitous as indoor plumbing.”The exciting bit is that the FRB discovered by Chime is repeating. Shostak explains: “There’s a short flash of radio energy – quicker than an eye blink – and then, maybe two days later, it flashes again.“The repetition tells you something about the cause of these radio flashes. Obviously, you can’t expect that colliding black holes or neutron stars are going to return to their corners and collide again a few days later. Whatever is responsible for this series of bursts has to be an ongoing phenomenon.“In addition, the phenomenon has to be tremendously energetic. The radio flashes come from billions of light years away.It’s lore among astronomy grad students that cosmic phenomena are either singular – in other words, there’s only one in the universe – or they’re very common“Clearly, something in that galaxy can muster sufficient energy to produce a signal detectable here on Earth. And it can come up with that energy every few days or so.”Taken on its own, the FRB discovery might not have caused as much general interest as it did. But the news came alongside another announcement, and that concerned ‘Oumuamua.‘Oumuamua is actually the Hawaiian word for scout, or messenger, but it has that lovely science fictional ring to it. A common trope of science fiction is the idea of the Big Dumb Object –\u0026nbspa huge, unknowable, alien structure that appears in our skies or on Earth, a mute testimony to the existence of extraterrestrial life. Think the monoliths from Arthur C Clarke’s 2001: A Space Odyssey or his novel Rendezvous with Rama, in which an enigmatic cylindrical object glides into our solar system.Clarke, who died in 2008, would have loved ‘Oumuamua. The name was coined by scientists at the University of Hawaii when they spotted the\u0026nbspstrange object passing through our system, not unlike Rama, in October 2017.‘Oumuamua was an asteroid –\u0026nbspor something similar –\u0026nbspan elongated lump of rock anything up to a kilometre long, and red in colour. It was notable in astronomical terms because it was the first time an object from outside our solar system was detected to be just passing through.There were the usual internet theories about it being something to do with aliens, of course, but they weren’t taken very seriously. Until October last year, when the chair of Harvard’s astronomy unit, Avi Loeb, went on the record to say, actually, this could be aliens, you know.Basing his statements on the observations that ‘Oumuamua appeared to accelerate at certain points during its passage past us, Loeb told German news magazine Der Spiegel that it “may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth’s vicinity by an alien civilisation”. He added: “If these beings are peaceful, we could learn a lot from them.”Scientists are generally a little wary about tossing around assertions that not only does alien life exist, but that\u0026nbspit has progressed to the point that it can disguise its spaceships as asteroids and send them spinning through the galaxy.Even Seti, which wears its heart on its sleeve when it comes to its mission to find alien life, has poured cold water on the repeating FRBs being of alien origin. Seth Shostak writes: “Aliens are frequently given the credit for causing new celestial phenomena. A half century ago, Soviet scientists suspected that quasars were actually signals broadcast by highly advanced societies far, far away. In the 1960s, British radio astronomers temporarily referred to pulsars as little green men.“But you can safely bet that aliens are not the cause of FRBs. Why? The bursters are seen all over the sky, that’s why. The same sort of signal is coming from galaxies that are generally separated by billions of light years. So how could aliens organise so much of the universe to engage in broadcasting the same sort of signal? There’s hardly been enough time since the Big Bang to coordinate such widespread teamwork, even if you can think of a reason for it!”This week The New Yorker magazine interviewed Loeb. He could reasonably have been expected to backtrack a little on his pronouncements from October regarding ‘Oumuamua. But not a bit of it. He went further, suggesting that ‘Oumuamua was some kind of solar-powered sail to account\u0026nbspfor its change in speeds, which you would not expect to see from a dead object simply drifting through space.Not believing in aliens is akin to believing the world is flat, vaccines cause autism, and the world was created in seven days. No sensible person believes we are alone in the universeLoeb told The New Yorker:\u0026nbsp“The only thing that came to my mind is that maybe the light from the sun, as it bounces off its surface, gives it an extra push. It’s just like a wind bouncing off a sail on a sailboat. So we checked that and found that you need the thickness of the object to be less than a millimetre in order for that to work. If it is indeed less than a millimetre thick, if it is pushed by the sunlight, then it is maybe a light sail, and I could not think of any natural process that would make a light sail. It is much more likely that it is being made by artificial means, by a technological civilisation.”But Loeb sounded a cautionary note for any ET fans out there. The civilisation that sent out ‘Oumuamua –\u0026nbspmuch in the same way we sent out the Voyager probes – could be long extinct, given the distances it might have travelled.But still, here’s a respected Harvard scientist saying that he believes in aliens: “I do not view the possibility of a technological civilisation as speculative, for two reasons. The first is that we exist. And the second is that at least a quarter of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy have a planet like Earth, with surface conditions that are very similar to Earth, and the chemistry of life as we know it could develop. If you roll the dice so many times, and there are tens of billions of stars in the Milky Way, it is quite likely we are not alone.”It’s the sort of thing people have been saying for years, but to hear it from such an august personage adds weight to the fact that belief in aliens is no longer confined to the tinfoil hat brigade.I punted out the question of whether aliens exist on social media. Perhaps it’s the sort of people who follow me, but nobody came out and said they didn’t believe in the existence of aliens. One reply on Twitter read: “Not believing in aliens is akin to believing the world is flat, vaccines cause autism, and the world was created in seven days. No sensible person believes we are alone in the universe.”Thinking exactly that seems to be ridiculed as much as the idea that there were aliens out there used to be not so long ago. One commenter called the idea “narcissistic” another said, “It would be bizarre to think we are the only life in the universe. Equally bizarre to believe that the universe is small enough for us ever to have the chance of meeting other life.”That last comment is perhaps indicative of the idea that while life might exist on other planets, we might never be able to get there, or vice versa.“Maybe not this year, but in the next five years,” asserts\u0026nbspauthor Rowan Coleman when I ask\u0026nbspon Facebook if 2019 is going to be a big year for aliens. “Nasa are sending probes to Europa and other moons with frozen water on them. There’s a lot of frozen water which is sometimes fluid on mars. Given that microbiotic life can survive on Earth in both freezing and boiling conditions, and in the vacuum of space, it seems pretty obvious we’d find this kind of life within our solar system.”Are aliens sending us messages from light years away?Nasa finds strange alien planet hiding outside our solar systemSatellite mistaken for meteorite crashes across sky above New ZealandNasa scientists plan to send a nuclear robot drill to hunt for aliensDo we really have a right to colonise Mars?David Darby adds:\u0026nbsp“My prediction is that everywhere you find liquid water you will find life – it has been shown to be the case on Earth no matter how extreme the environment. We may only discover microscopic unicellular life as this is the only life that can be expected within our universe. Interstellar travel times would mean that any galactic empire would probably remain undiscovered as our technology won’t get us there. Our planet has been here long enough for them to visit us if they had the technology or inclination. The fact that they haven’t would probably mean that interstellar travel is a technological problem with no solution. The one thing we can be sure of is that ‘the truth is out there’…”The idea of discovering microscopic life is one that has gained much more traction in recent years, and Coleman’s point about life on Earth surviving in extreme conditions is one that comedian Ben Miller made heavily in his recent book The Aliens Are Coming!Miller – who studied at Cambridge for a PhD in solid state physics –\u0026nbspis firmly of the belief that life is out there,\u0026nbspbut that we’re likely to find microbes before the silver spaceships come flying.He tells me about microbes that exist\u0026nbspin hot springs in Yellowstone National Park\u0026nbspin temperatures of 90C, about 30 degrees above what they should be able to withstand. If they can survive in those conditions here on Earth, why not on other planets?Are alien civilisations sending out repeating radio signals and solar-powered probes to investigate life on Earth? What used to be a belief that was cause for ridicule now seems to be much more widely accepted as not just true, but inevitable.Will we find life – whether microscopic bug\u0026nbspor galactic empire – in 2019? It feels, on recent evidence, that if we’re going to make contact, then this year, or the next, or maybe the next after that, seems increasingly likely.

Some may have taken out hedges against such currency volatility. But those that haven’t will find their costs rise sharply. Smaller firms, in particular, are much less likely to have hedging protection.Liam Fox, the trade secretary, has this week floated the idea of the government abolishing all import tariffs entirely in a no-deal scenario. This could (notwithstanding delivery delays) mean a surge in the availability of cheap manufactured or produce imports from around the world. Even firms that only serve the UK domestic market and don’t import at all could struggle to cope with this sudden burst of cheaper competition.Another factor for domestic-focused firms to consider is the macroeconomic impact of no deal. If this inflicts a severe shock to the overall UK economy – resulting in lower consumer spending and a slump in investment spending by firms – that would probably hit the sales of most domestic firms, regardless of any border or tariff issues. If a no-deal Brexit harms the financial sector, domestic firms may find it harder to access bank borrowing.These firms could also be hit by a shortage of workers if a no-deal scenario results in an exodus of EU workers. Almost a tenth of workers in the construction sector – 200,000 – are EU-born. In retail, hotels and restaurants the share is 25 per cent.The important thing to remember about the UK economy is that everything is connected – no firm, whatever its main market, is an island.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Meanwhile, a separate\u0026nbspcompensation scheme that has been promised by the Home Office is still not in place.Ms McKenzie said: “I\u0027m concerned that we\u0027re told one thing is happening but the practice appears to be very different. These delays are aggravating features of people\u0027s pain and suffering and really inexplicable.Ms Cooper claimed\u0026nbspthe statistics from the home secretary\u0026nbsp“simply didn’t match” the hardship the committee has observed among Windrush citizens who have been wrongly targeted by immigration enforcement.“While the compensation scheme is still not up and running, the Home Office should be making every effort to support Windrush citizens, alerting people to support that’s available and proactively offering it,” she added.Windrush deaths prompt accusations Government ‘pandering to far right’In the update, Mr Javid also revealed that of the 83 iniduals found to have been wrongly removed from the UK, 10 have since died. The Home Office has made contact with 52, while they have been unable to contact a further 21.More than one in five Windrush scheme decisions have failed to be made within the Home Office’s two-week target, the update showed. The Independent revealed last year that delays in the process had prevented people attending family funerals and heightened their anxiety.Overall, a total of\u0026nbsp2,453 people have been given documentation confirming status. The majority were from the Caribbean islands,\u0026nbspwith the second most common nationality from India (107)\u0026nbspand the third Nigeria (60).Mr Javid said the Vulnerable Persons Team, a seperate scheme designed to provide help and advice where vulnerability issues are identified, has\u0026nbspprovided support to 614 iniduals, with 52 cases ongoing, and continues to\u0026nbspreceive 10 to 20 new referrals each week.The Home Secretary told the Committee: “I continue to believe it is important that we take a cross party-approach which recognises the most important thing we can do is ensure the wrongs which some members of the Windrush generation have faced are put right.\u0026nbsp“I can reassure members that my department remains entirely focussed on righting the wrongs experienced by the Windrush generation.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

What she said already in Belfast: there’s no question to remove the backstop, because that is absolutely necessary for securing and safeguarding the Good Friday Agreement, internal market, and peace process.”The prime minister is understood to have received a similar message from Donald Tusk, the European Council president who represents the collective views of member states.Jeremy Corbyn writes to Theresa May outlining his five Brexit demands Sources with knowledge of the meeting between\u0026nbspMr Tusk and the prime minister said the president told Ms May that “the Corbyn plan could be a promising way out of the impasse”, according to\u0026nbspBuzzfeed News.EU officials who examined the Labour plan believe it to be broadly in line with EU negotiating guidelines, the website says.Labour last night called for a “permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union”, close alignment with the single market underpinned by “shared institutions”, protections on workers rights, and UK participation in some EU agencies. The policy moves the party closer to a so-called “Norway+” Brexit that would keep the UK in the bloc’s orbit, though technically outside.In a joint statement the British government and European Commission said Ms May had had a “robust but constructive” meeting with president Jean-Claude Juncker, and that the pair would meet again before the end of the month.The two negotiating teams have been formally stood down since the withdrawal agreement was agreed between the two sides last year, with the EU saying it did not anticipate any further meetings. But with MPs in Westminster blocking the ratification of the agreement, officials will begin meeting again.The joint statement said the gathering was “held in a spirit of working together to achieve the UK’s orderly withdrawal from the EU”.Theresa May is said to have explained the situation in Westminster to Mr Juncker and raised “various options for dealing with these concerns”.But Mr Juncker responded by underlining that the EU27 would not reopen the withdrawal agreement – describing it as ”a carefully balanced compromise between the European Union and the UK, in which both sides have made significant concessions to arrive at a deal”.He however “expressed his openness to add wording to the political declaration agreed by the EU27 and the UK in order to be more ambitious in terms of content and speed when it comes to the future relationship between the European Union and the UK”, according to the read-out of the meeting.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentThe statement concluded: “The discussion was robust but constructive. Despite the challenges, the two leaders agreed that their teams should hold talks as to whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European Council. The prime minister and the president will meet again before the end of February to take stock of these discussions.”Ms May’s meeting Mr Tusk comes a day after he caused a row by warning that there was a “special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit without even a basic plan for how to actually enact it. Speaking after her meeting she said: “I’ve raised with President Tusk the language that he used yesterday which was not helpful and caused widespread dismay in the UK.\u0026nbspThe point I made to him is that we should both be working to ensure we should deliver a close relationship between the UK and EU in the future and that’s what he should be focusing on.”Speaking on her way back to London, she added: “I’ve had a good series of meetings today. We’ve had robust discussions but they’ve been constructive.\u0026nbsp“What I’ve set out is our clear position: that we must secure legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement to deal with the concerns that parliament has over the backstop. Taking that: changes with the backstop, together with the other work we’re doing on workers’ rights and other issues, will deliver a stable majority in parliament. That’s what I’ve continued to push for.”Mr Tusk said there was “still no breakthrough in sight” and that “talks will continue”.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That\u0027s not something that\u0027s allowed under the European treaties.This seems to be wishful thinking.Theresa May will use talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald\u0026nbspTusk and other prominent EU figures to press for legally binding guarantees on Irish\u0026nbspbackstop.The backstop, which is intended to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland, would see the UK continue to obey EU customs rules after a transition period if no wider trade deal had been reached.Downing Street said that the PM will insist that the UK cannot be trapped in the backstop. She is\u0026nbspopen to different ways of achieving her objectives but they must be legally binding.The PM will say parliament has sent an unequivocal message that change is required but MPs have made it clear they can support her deal if the backstop is addressed.Liam Fox has warned MPs risk making the pitfalls of a no-deal Brexit more likely by voting against the Government\u0027s Withdrawal Agreement.The international trade secretary, asked about processing trade deals with minimal delays, told the Commons: In terms of the continuity of agreements we already have, the best way to ensure full continuity is to have a deal.All those who talk about the pitfalls of no deal would do well to remember that in voting against a deal they make those pitfalls all the more likely.Labour accused Dr Fox of giving away the shop before negotiations start after reports he is planning on scrapping all import tariffs post-Brexit.The cabinet minister replied: The government has made no decision on this, when we do so we will communicate it to stakeholders, the public and Parliament.Of course the best way to avoid this scenario is to have a deal with the European Union and whipping up fear about people\u0027s jobs is simply the humbug that has become the hallmark of Mr Esterson.\u0026nbspThis comes off the back of a story in the Huffington Post, which revealed roaming charges could be brought overnight for Brits abroad in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspAndrea Leadsom\u0026nbspconfirms there will be a debate on Theresa May\u0027s\u0026nbspBrexit deal on Thursday, February 14.The PM will bring a \u0027revised deal\u0027 back to the House for a second meaningful vote \u0027as soon as she can\u0027. If that\u0027s not possible by Feb 13, the government will table an amendable motion on Thursday.Downing Street confirmed that Jeremy\u0026nbspCorbyn\u0027s letter had been received, and a spokeswoman added: We will reply in due course. Our positions on many of the issues in the letter are well known. Our position on the backstop has not changed.The spokeswoman said that no further meeting between Mrs May and the Labour leader to discuss Brexit had been scheduled, but added that her door is open.NEW: A joint statement has dropped from Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president.Talks were robust but constructive, which is politician-speak for pretty tough. Another key takeaway is they are planning to meet at the end of February, which is dangerously close to exit day on March 29. Are we getting closer to a delay?Read it in full below:Prime Minister May and President Juncker have met today to review the next steps in the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.The talks were held in a spirit of working together to achieve the UK’s orderly withdrawal from the EU, especially in the context of a shared determination to achieve a strong partnership for the future given the global challenges the EU and the UK face together in upholding open and fair trade, cooperation in the fight against climate change and terrorism and defending the rules-based international system.The Prime Minister described the context in the UK Parliament, and the motivation behind last week’s vote in the House of Commons seeking a legally binding change to the terms of the backstop. She raised various options for dealing with these concerns in the context of the Withdrawal Agreement in line with her commitments to the Parliament.President Juncker underlined that the EU27 will not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, which represents a carefully balanced compromise between the European Union and the UK, in which both sides have made significant concessions to arrive at a deal. President Juncker however expressed his openness to add wording to the Political Declaration agreed by the EU27 and the UK in order to be more ambitious in terms of content and speed when it comes to the future relationship between the European Union and the UK. President Juncker drew attention to the fact that any solution would have to be agreed by the European Parliament and the EU27.The discussion was robust but constructive. Despite the challenges, the two leaders agreed that their teams should hold talks as to whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK Parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European Council. The Prime Minister and the President will meet again before the end of February to take stock of these discussions.The young will “neither forget nor forgive” the politicians responsible for\u0026nbspBrexit if they end up being its biggest victims,\u0026nbspSir John Major\u0026nbsphas warned.The former\u0026nbspConservative\u0026nbspprime minister issued a chilling warning to his own party that it will be punished by a generation that “fear for their future” as the UK leaves the EU.Full story here:The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is worth having a full look through all of those pages.Facebook banned from mixing up WhatsApp and Instagram data by GermanyThere\u0027s one thing to beware of: even though the feature locks access to the\u0026nbspapp, it doesn\u0027t lock the notifications. That means if someone has your phone then they\u0027ll still be able to see messages when they come in, and will even be able to reply to them if they pull down and use the quick reply feature.That can be turned off easily, though it once again means sacrificing ease for security. To do so, head into the notifications option in the Settings app, click on WhatsApp and turn off show previews.The same can be done with other apps, though many have not yet integrated the biometric settings and so anyone with your phone is likely to be able to get into your messages. Apple does not offer a way to lock specific apps, meaning that developers have to introduce the features if they are to be included.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A House of Lords report came to the conclusion that while there could be a moral obligation, under UK, EU and international law there was no valid or forceful claim.The only motive for paying is to secure a good future deal, rather than to pay a ransom for our freedom.Yet I have come to the conclusion that leaving on March  is at risk and exiting the EU is a prize worth paying for and on which thewill be great.Unfortunately, in spite of the Referendum result, the majority of MPs are reluctant to see the UK part from the EU and at the least want terms that mirror our membership.This may well not be the view of most voters, who seem to welcome the clean break and are not fearful of the scare stories.It is, therefore, crucial to ensure the fears of those who are far from enthusiastic Brexiteers are assuaged. This is where the Malthouse Compromise comes in.By offering money and making the prospect of a No Deal Brexit unlikely, possible moderate former Remainers are willing to avoid Parliamentary tactics that would frustrate our departure.They can accept the replacement of the backstop, which could keep us tied in to the EU’s rules and courts forever, with a routine trade agreement based on existing processes commonly used around the world.This would not hamper the development of a future relationship which would be discussed once we have left. Although in these discussions we would lose the leverage of cash, we would not be squeezed by the backstop.The second stage of the compromise is that the implementation period could be extended by one year. Currently the withdrawal agreement proposes a maximum of two years.In this time we would remain subject to EU laws and what follows, but it makes the prospect of not finalising a future relationship less likely, which gives comfort to those who are determined to avoid No Deal.In my view, an extra  months of vassalage after  years is an unwelcome but not unaffordable price to pay. Critics may ask why Brexiteers want to lessen the chance of a No Deal departure — and the reason is simple.Regardless of the folly of Project Fear, which becomes more preposterous by the day, the Parliamentary arithmetic means we must either lessen the prospect by compromise or it will be done by sharp practice in the House of Commons.This could lead to delay or even no Brexit at all. This would destroy any remaining trust of politicians in our constitutional settlement, it would show reckless contempt for voters, yet the Brexit-denying amendment put forward by Yvette Cooper last week was only defeated by  votes.As with all compromises, Malthouse is not perfect but is enough for each side of the argument in the UK to accept.The question remains, will the EU response be positive  So far, it has not.This has always been at the heart of the debate, and in a way a compelling reason for going. Is the EU a Mafia-style organisation that has to punish countries that do not subscribe to its religion Their response to the Malthouse Compromise and the PM’s request to re-open the text will answer this question. It must be clear to the EU that the current withdrawal agreement will not do.Defeated in the Commons by the largest margin ever achieved in the lower house on Government business, it is simply too one-sided and allows too great a triumph to the EU.If the EU were to insist on its inalterability requiring the punishment of a recalcitrant, freedom-loving nation then it will reveal its true and barbarous colours. It would be evident on its own that we are right to leave.How much better it would bethis were wrong and that in fact the EU is the civilised organisation it claims to be — respecting democracy, the nation state and constitutional procedures.

Her squabbling party has called a temporary truce. And nobody, including the EU, wants Jeremy Corbyn to take control.Even Labour MPs are rallying behind her — at a price. And working-class voters have given the Tories a healthy seven-point lead. They might even win a snap election.Played skilfully, this could win a deal that satisfies both Remainers and Leavers.Yet there are fears Mrs May will use it to revive her wretched Chequers plan, which sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis, or the botched deal thrown out last month by a -vote margin.She has made a worrying start by apparently binning the No Deal card — the only one that truly scares the EU. Mrs May has no intention of playing this ace — and never had.There are other worrying signs.This showdown with EU hardliners requires fresh thinking and shrewd advice from seasoned players. Crawford Falconer, an ex-World Trade Organisation ambassador, was recruited by the Brexit department for precisely these skills.Indeed, he is the ONLY person in the Government machine who has ever negotiated a trade deal.Yet bafflingly, Mrs May is keeping this star player on the sidelines.Instead, she will fly to Brussels with Whitehall mandarin Olly Robbins, the pro-EU fanatic who plunged Britain into the backstop trap she is now under pressure to escape from.Robbins hates Brexit and has privately warned the PM this is Mission Impossible.Mrs May — herself a Remainer who has never grasped the case for Brexit — will be joined by trusted “deputy PM” David Lidington, a dyed-in-the-wool Brussels worshipper.In such company, even the inclusion in her team of a thundering Brexiteer Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox is only mildly reassuring.Mrs May is notoriously stubborn. She can also be devious.After nearly three years, even her closest political colleagues — who can be counted on one hand with a couple of missing digits — have no idea what her Brexit might look like.Voters are increasingly irritated by this foot-dragging.Why should we remain part of an organisation that wants to punish us by stealing Gibraltar, Northern Ireland and our car industry Nobody who watched the brutal humiliation of poor little Greece will be surprised. This tragic and insolvent nation should never have been admitted to the EU, still less the Eurozone.Only with the assistance of US banking giant Goldman Sachs — “The Vampire Squid” — got them in under the wire. Once inside, they launched a borrowing and spending binge which ended in tears in the  crash.Greece might have flourished as a cheap but lovely tourist economy. Instead, it is now being cruelly tormented by Brussels and lumbered with multi-billion euros debts it can never repay.Greece symbolises all that is wrong with arrogant Brussels — the catastrophic Euro, inflexible economic policies and mass unemployment for under-s.Above all, there is the sneering contempt of unsackable Eurocrats for the million people they rule from subsidised ivory towers.Theresa May is a poor negotiator who never truly believed No Deal is better than a bad deal.Without this implicit threat, Brussels will give little and demand much in . It would be a pleasure to eat my words and watch Mrs May play a blinder.She can use her good luck to land a historic victory. Or she can blink and condemn Britain to colony status, paying billions more into EU coffers while being led by the nose on trade deal promises that never materialise.In which case, forget about that snap election fantasy.The Conservative Party would never be forgiven by the .million voters who voted Brexit — or those who wish they had.SECURITY CHIEFS are dusting off Cold War plans anticipating a Soviet nuclear strike to whisk the Queen to safety in the event of . . .  er . . . a No Deal Brexit.Presumably The Mall will be cleared of traffic and used as a landing strip to fly Her Maj out before revolutionary Remainers string her up for supporting Brexit.The only question is whether she will go quietly.The royals refused to leave London even after Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Second World War.This Project Fear nonsense is even more insane than the idea that thousands will die of fruit shortages.To quote Corporal Jones: “Don’t panic!!”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I love you. I have one father. Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationship.’“He writes her a really long letter in , and he closes it by requesting a photo op with her.“She feels like, ‘That’s the opposite of what I’m saying. I’m telling you I don’t want to communicate through the media, and you’re asking me to communicate through the media. Did you hear anything I said ’“It’s almost like they’re ships passing.“He knows how to get in touch with her.“It’s super-painful because Meg was always so dutul.“I think she will always feel genuinely devastated by what he’s done. At the same time, because she’s a daughter, she has a lot of sympathy for him.”The close friends spoke anonymously to US magazine People after Thomas made a string of public outbursts about his royal daughter and Meghan’s half-sister Samantha cashed in on their “non-existent” relationship.The Sun understands the pals spoke to People with Meghan’s approval, and that her press team at Kensington Palace were kept in the dark.One friend said: “Meg has sat silently back and endured the lies and untruths.“We want to stand up against the global bullying we are seeing and speak the truth about who our friend, a  mother-to-be, really is.“We worry about what this is doing to her and the baby. It’s wrong to put anyone under this level of emotional trauma, let alone when they’re pregnant.”The pals vehemently defend the Duchess and reveal she was devastated by her father’s response to her letter and did not talk to him after that.They also claim that:They said Thomas’s older children, Thomas Markle Junior and Samantha Grant, “were in their mid-to-late teens when  Meghan was born” and “were not a part of her le”.The friend added: “They’ve been made to appear as siblings who were very close and then they had this falling out, and that’s not the truth at all.“Fast-forward to Meghan dating Harry and now Samantha isname Markle. And then she began this career capitalising on Meg.“Everyone who knows Meg knows the two of them have no relationship.”The same friend also gave Meghan’s side of the story, after her dad Thomas pulled out of walking her down the aisle at the royal wedding due to a heart attack.They told the magazine Meghan had looked after her father financially, despite what  Samantha had claimed.They said: “Meghan’s been a rock for everyone in her family.“It’s a shame that it’s being painted in this other light that is just absolutely .“She took care of her father with such incredible generosity.“The fact that this could be flipped around, that she was acting out or not caring for him, is preposterous.“The Saturday before the wedding, she and Harry were told that a story was going to come out the next day saying that Tom was staging pictures with the paparazzi.“Their team told them thatthe story was fake, they could file a complaint.“So Meg calls Tom and asks him, and he’s swearing up and down that it’s not true. The next day the pictures come out.“Even with all that, Meg and Harry were still so focused on getting him to London.“At no point was there talk of, ‘Now that we know he lied, he’s in trouble’.“Tom wouldn’t take her calls, wouldn’t take Harry’s calls. The next morning when the car got there , he wouldn’t get in.“ Meg heard he’d had a heart attack and she’s calling him and texting him, even up to the night before the wedding.“It was like, ‘Please pick up. I love you, and I’m scared.’ It was endless.”Another friend revealed how spiritual Meghan was, saying she meditates and “really lives in the current moment”.They also reveal that the Duchess does all her own make-up, dresses and styles herself and writes her own speeches for herself and Harry.Former actress Meghan has been accused of intimidating staff with am emails and a “demanding manner”.But one of her former colleagues on US TV drama Suits said: “The email thing is such a weird slant on someone who is actually an incredibly organized, diligent, focused, hard-working person.“She was always that way.“She showed up on set more prepared than anyone .”Meghan was also praised for providing hand-warmers for Palace guards standing in the cold weather and for laying on an ice-cream and sorbet stand for her staff.Kensington Palace refused to comment.NOVEMBER , : Meghan and Harry announce  engagement but he admits he hasn’t met her dad Thomas.DECEMBER :   Thomas  tells reporters he’d “love to” walk his daughter down the aisle.MAY , :  Kensington Palace  says Thomas will be giving his daughter away.MAY : It’s revealed he took cash, allegedly £,,  for staged paparazzi pictures.MAY : He pulls out of the wedding for health reasons.MAY : The royal wedding.JUNE :   Thomas appears on Good Morning Britain to say the photos were a “mistake”.JULY : He gives a newspaper interview claiming his daughter would be “nothing without me”.AUGUST :   He reveals he once slammed the phone down on  Harry during a heated call over the snaps.OCTOBER :  The royal couple announce they’re expecting baby in  the spring.OCTOBER :    Thomas says he heard about his grandchild on the car radio.NOVEMBER  DECEMBER:   He gives more damaging   interviews, saying things like he hopes to meet the baby one day despite Meghan “ghosting” him since her wedding.JANUARY , :  He  tells The Sun  he is writing a tell-all book about his daughter.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ever.You cannot ever even call in sick as that is not allowed.We are British, but generally cannot ever manage to hire British due to poor work ethics.Following the row, Jullian has stood by his views, claiming that the work ethic of Brits are inferior to those from Eastern Europe.Jullian said: Our experience of running a small, private, family-run coffee shop in Hove is that the very poorest type of employee is a British one. Full stop.The last candidate you want to take on - and we try ardently to hire everyone - is British.He added that Brits take advantage of the fact they have a benefit system and theyre not motivated to earn money.Jullian said his business has been hit with floods of bad reviews online from angry Brits after Victoria posted screenshots of their conversation on Facebook.A TUC spokesperson said: “If he’s looking for the title of Britain’s Worst Boss, it sounds like he’s going about it the right way.“It’s illegal to discriminate against job applicants based on their ethnicity.

You are nothing but a sperm donor.”Amber who stormed out of her home in Mansfield, Notts, in May  after being ordered to clean out a cool box. She was found hanged in a hedgerow three days later.A inquest into her death has heard claims the teenager was being emotionally abused at home and subjected to a series of draconian punishments – including being told to wash every pot in the kitchen - for undesirable behaviour.Mr Cook gave evidence to the Nottingham hearing on its ninth day after deciding to attend in person.It was originally only intended a statement from him would be read.He told coroner Laurinda Bower how he and Kelly met around  and had two children – Amber and a sibling, who can’t be named – before splitting on Christmas Eve , when he moved out of the family home in Derbys.Mr Cook said he last saw his children in early , when Amber was , and took them for a meal in a pub. He claimed she was happy and cheerful – until he said he had to take her home.Asked by Ms Bower why that was the final time he saw them, Mr Cook replied: “My shts were all over the place.“I tried to ring Kelly and said I would be off this week, and Kelly said I could not see them at the drop of a hat.“I would ring and it would be, ‘we are going here’, or ‘we are going there’.“Every time I phoned her it would be ‘inconvenient’. There would be ‘family business’ to see to, or ‘we are taking them here, or there’.“The last time was a heated discussion. It was getting to the point where you are beaten down by it. I wanted to see the children.”Mr Cook said that during their last conversation, Kelly told him: “You just can’t see them when you want to.”The inquest heard he considered talking to a solicitor, but didn’t feel he had a leg to stand on.At some point around March , he went to their home – but found it was empty.Mr Cook said: “I went to a friends’ house on the estate, but they said that one morning they woke up and they had upped and gone. I had no idea where they’d gone.”He added the next contact he had with the Peats was on the day after Amber disappeared.Mr Cook told the hearing: “I found out in Facebook so I tried to contact Kelly with the number off the missing person posters.“I got vile abuse off Danny – ‘she is not your f****** daughter, she wants nothing to do with you, you are nothing but a sperm donor.“I phoned back again and spoke to Danny’s mum. I didn’t get much information. I was in deep shock about it.”He added he didn’t know about any issues surrounding his daughter that the inquest had heard about, including her running away from home previously and problems at school.His mum Jenner Lancaster – Amber’s grandmother – told the hearing her granddaughter was a lovely, sweet, lovable child who liked to cuddle and play silly girly things like dressing up, and with her make-up bag.Mrs Lancaster said she saw Amber quite frequently when she was young – but when her son and Kelly split up she only saw her two or three times before her death.One of the occasions was Valentines’ Day in , when Danny wanted to cook Kelly a romantic meal and the children went to stay with her for the weekend.But Mrs Lancaster said Amber was weepy because she had overheard a conversation between Kelly and her mum, Dianne Gillibrand, in which they had said she wouldn’t want them.Mrs Lancaster said: “I told them I would always want them. How can you not want two little children like that, that give you so much pleasure “It struck me as odd.”Mrs Lancaster next saw the young siblings on Mother’s Day , but they couldn’t stop for long because Kelly was waiting in her car outside. She gave them a pair of charm bracelets, and expected to see them again before she went into hospital that April for a knee operation – but never did.She told the hearing: “I got a message from Kelly to say they loved the bracelets, and that was it.“I bought them Easter eggs and sent a message to seethey would be coming for them. And I wanted to get Amber a birthday present because I was going in hospital. But the messagewas, ‘don’t know, not sure’. That was it.”Mrs Lancaster added that she went to the family home in a bid to see them – but found they had moved.When she contacted Kelly to ask for the new address – only to be told: “I am not comfortable with you having it.”She said: “I thought, ‘this is really strange’, but that is the way it was.”Mrs Lancaster found out Amber had gone missing through her sister, and panicked. She said she had no concerns about her granddaughter’s behaviour, and what had happened came as a shock.Referring to the Peats, she said: “They trust you with their kids and then stop you seeing them, and the next thing you know she is missing.“It’s horrible, it really is horrible.The inquest continues."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/VP-MAP-USA.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"booming sounds shake houses america experts baffled","story":"Experts have been left baffled by a spate of seismic booms from Arizona to New York that appear to have gathered pace over the past week.The string of phenomena was first reported last Thursday morning when locals in three separate Tennessee counties reported hearing loud booming noises.On the same day, North Carolinians contacted police reporting unexplained loud blasts and booms that kept them awake at night.Two homeowners said the booms were so powerful that they briefly lost power as a result of the tremors, Mysterious Universe reported.Similarly unexplained explosions have been reported happening in isolation over the past years, but rarely with this frequency.On Saturday, loud bangs were reported in Rhode Island, where Jeremy Brazas doorbell captured a video and audio of a loud noise over a three minute period.The whole house shook, he told TurnTo.

Personally, I didn’t.What I hope we’re all agreed on, though, is the fact that Danny’s too busy playing Danny Dyer, the professional geezer, to be a good listener or natural TV historian.It’s an act that worked, of course, when he was wondering, “Eleanor of Aquitaine, was she a looker ” but didn’t serve him so well when presented with a longbow.“Long, innit ”The Beeb clocked this before production started, obviously, so had paired him up with dozens of head-patting historians and actors who got him to dress up as every kind of medieval t**t you can imagine. Like Mr Benn on crack, it was.Armour, codpieces, nappies, tights, doublet and hose, and a gigantic white smock, bleached with human urine, which had one grovelling “courtier” wondering: “Has all the p*** been washed out, my Lord King ”A good question.We didn’t actually get the answer, though, until part two, on Wednesday, when, after a brief detour round his ancestors, Louis IX of France, William the Conqueror and Henry II, viewers got to the nub of things, with Professor Chris Given-Wilson explaining the agonising death of Edward II: “By thrusting a hollow instrument, like the end of a trumpet, up his fundament.”“’Old on a minute,” said a rattled Danny. “He’s been stabbed  With a trumpet ”“Into his fundament.” Long pause.“Don’t tell me it’s up his a**e ”Right up it, Danny, with a red-hot poker. News which didn’t just do his “nut in”, it seemed to derail the entire documentary.They ran out of direct royal ancestors shortly afterwards as well, and the BBC adopted its stupid default setting in such circumstances. It turned Danny’s Right Royal Family into a dance and cookery show, complete with demonstrations of both, from medieval experts.It was about this time I also sussed out what was going on in the background, with all those winsome historians. An audition.The BBC was using it to find its new face of history, though why any of the blokes turned up is a mystery. Auntie’s already made it clear: “The days of white, middle-aged men explaining stuff are over.”Danny, on the other hand, can be tolerated, because he’s their new performing Cockney. A novelty act who can be dressed up and patronised so much he ended this one doing some weird medieval can-can, with his family, in front of his lost ancestral pile.A trumpet wasn’t quite shoved up his fundament as they danced, but the p*** had very much been washed out of him, my Lord King.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month. “I think it’s going to be a really great show.” Cheryl Tweedy, The Greatest Dancer.“We do TV shows and we’re national treasures.” Jedward, Celebrity Coach Trip.“People will remember my name and I love that.” Some t**t off Ship- wrecked.IF you’re to take anything from the news experts have claimed Monday, January  was the most depressing day of the year, it’s probably the fact the experts clearly never sat through what happened eight days later, on Tuesday, January .Britain’s Top  Dogs Live: . All two-and-a-half yapping hours of it, on ITV, with a bad hangover, in the company of presenters Ben Fogle and Sara Cox.A test beyond personal endurance not because of the alcohol or dogs, who are a largely blameless lot, but the presence of their barmy owners, who attribute all sorts of superpowers to their dumb little mutts and blur the human animal relationship way beyond the point of reason and sometimes even good taste.Hits Radio DJ Gemma Atkinson, for instance, claimed: “I wouldn’t be where I am today without Norman”, her pet sproodle.Which is a hell of a guilt trip to pin on any dog.While Spandau Ballet’s Martin Kemp was seen, sitting alongside Popsie the poodle and his Wham! backing-singer we Shirlie, exclaiming: “I’ll say this for her,she does do a poo she goes into the spare bathroom.”The least you’d expect, frankly, after  years of marriage.The case study that really finished me off, though, was a dog dancing instructor called Joan Clark and her powder puff hounds, whose act, as described by Sara Cox, was: “All building up to the big finish. Can she pull it off  Joan points to the spot and it’s one, two, three pups between her legs.”CHANNEL ’s Pure is a comedy drama about a woman who suffers from the sixth sense of seeing naked people and is so tormented by her condition she screams: “F***ing stop.

But that man, Shane Hart, did have a bit of luck that night, as caring Nicole White and her family took him and his beloved dog Kimmy to Rotherham Soup Kitchen. It was a helping hand that has now seen Shane, , rescued from le on the streets. He had been kicked out of his flat in the South Yorkshire town for having Kimmy, who he’d rescued, and had been living in nearby Kimberworth Park.  “I’d been feeling so guilty, I was scared I was hurting Kimmy because it was so cold,” he said. She hadn’t asked for all this. “It was so cold the condensation in the tent turned into icicles and the zip was frozen shut. It even hurt to breathe in.”  It was love at first sight five months ago for Shane when he spotted Kimmy, a runt of the litter who’d been rejected by its mum and left shivering in a cage. He bottle fed the Whippet-cross, and when forced to leave his “no-dogs” flat, named her Kimmy after the park they were living in.  “I was suffering from depression but Kimmy saved my le. Twice, she saved my le,” he said. “She’s all I’ve got and makes me smile every day. She’s all I live for.” Ten days ago someone slashed Shane’s tent and trashed his belongings. Since then he’s been spending hours every day begging, once making pound after four hours, which he immediately spent on a dog coat for Kimmy.Another day he collected just enough to buy a pasty. Not for himself, for Kimmy.After Nicole, , husband Mitchell, , and their son Dylan drove him to the soup kitchens he was clearly stunned, and wept as he was handed hot food, sleeping bags and dog biscuits. As the Street Paws charity treated Kimmy to worm and flea treatment and inoculations, he looks at his bag of gts, hugs his pet and cries again, saying: “Oh wow. I don’t believe this, it’s too much all this” The pair clearly have an incredible bond, as Kimmy kisses his tears away.  Shane has now been given accommodation by Rotherham Borough Council, whose Assistant Director of Housing, Tom Bell, said: “The council is funding temporary accommodation for this gentleman and his dog while we work with him to find a permanent home.”  Street Paws founder, Michelle Southern, who has just opened their st outreach, says only  per cent of hostels accept dogs.She said the rough sleepers’ dogs they see are incredibly well looked after.“I’ve known people to be sat in an ambulance but refuse treatment because they are worried about what is going to happen to their dog,” she said."},{"url":null,"title":"people tissue thin slice away","story":"NewsPeople are a tissue thin slice away from disaster: Homeless mans warning to us allWe spoke to homeless people at Encompass Southwest in Barnstaple, Devon, as part of our Mirror On The Street investigation into rough sleepingShareByAdam Aspinall:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsRichards relationship breakdown led him to ruin and he has never quite recovered \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHomelessness can strike anyone, at anytime. That was the message The Daily Mirror learned on a visit to a breakfast club for rough sleepers this week. Never more was this in evidence then -year-old Richard. Once a respected news reporter on a local paper it seemed he had the world at his feet. But like so many homeless people a relationship breakdown led him to ruin and he has never quite recovered. He has lived on and off the streets ever since. He said: “People are a tissue thin slice away from disaster, they just don’t think about it.” Richard, who along with others in this article did not wish to give his full name, was just one of many vulnerable adults and young people who wandered in and out of the breakfast club organised by independent homeless charity Encompass Southwest, based in Barnstaple, Devon.  The charity has gone from a tiny soup kitchen in  to employing  full and part-time members of staff who provide a range of service to tough sleepers in North Devon from advice, to support services and housing. One of the many services Encompass offer rough sleepers is a popular breakfast club every Tuesday morning in the spare room of a local radio station. Manned by staff and volunteers at least  rough sleepers came and went from am until noon all with ying stories to tell but all just thankful for a warm breakfast. The age range was shocking, the youngest was  and the eldest , from a wide iety of walks of le. Frightened Will, , revealed he was kicked out of his house by his parents and has slept rough for five months. He says there are lots of people who try to take advantage of him so admitted he has carried a weapon in the past to feel safe. He said: “It’s a nightmare out there, people will abuse youthey can so you have to be wary, I’m just focusing on getting out of this situation the best way I can.”  Gavin, , said he used to be able earn as much pound a day when he ran his own tiling business but a relationship break-up saw him lose everything. He now sleeps in a park which he describes as “scary”. He said people need to understand that “homelessness can happen to anyone, at anytime.” Amongst the many cheerful volunteers was humble AE nurse Sarah Gabe, . She volunteers at the breakfast club every week and admitted it took some time to win the rough sleeper’s trust but now she can use of her medical skills to treat them directly.  She said: “It took about six months for them to trust me to the point where they now come to me with problems. “It is mainly simple things like foot care and listening to their chests but when you are sleeping rough small things can become big problems so it is great that I can see them directly and help them where I can.”  One rough sleeper at the breakfast club who has definitely benefited from Encompass’s hands-on approach is -year-old Paul. Originally from London he explained he drted out to Devon because it was “safer” but a mixture of drink and drug problems have kept him on the streets ever since. He is what homelessness experts describe as ‘entrenched’ and in years gone by may never have got the help he required and could easily have died on the streets. But Encompass have adopted a new scheme called Housing First which started in the USA in the s and has since spread to Europe. The idea behind the approach is to give entrenched rough sleepers like Paul some control over where they live and how rather then assigning them places to live under strict rules and regulations. The British Government has recently invested poundm in Housing First pilot projects across the country. While Encompass have not received any of that money they have copied the approach and slowly persuaded Paul to live in his own flat after years on the streets. According to his Encompass support worker like Becky Fausset, , who has been working with rough sleepers for over  years, Paul’s new flat could very well be the dference between le and death. She said: “These are people that another winter and they could be dead and that is not being dramatic, so being able to get them into accommodation is very rewarding. “Housing First is dficult but incredibly positive, the dficulty is finding the properties, but so far it seems to be working. “People come to pretty places like Barnstaple and North Devon and don’t realise what is really going on and how many people are really struggling.” Paul finally moved in this week but when The Mirror visited the flat with him on Monday for the first time he was overwhelmed.  He said: “I can’t believe it, I feel like a real person again, someone that’s worth something, this is everything and I’m not going to let it go.” According to the latest research from the respected IPPR think-tank there was  per cent rise in rough sleeping in rural areas from  in  to  in . Butyou speak to people working on the front line of this problem they will tell you privately the true figures are likely to be much higher because the issue is so dficult to record. The Daily Mirror spent two days there with the dedicated staff of one homeless charity this week in a bid to highlight this worrying trend. We were hosted by the indomitable Claire Fisher, the CEO of Encompass.  Fighting her own personal battle against cancer Claire thinks nothing of manning the front lines each day and can be seen walking the streets and dishing out food to rough sleepers with her fellow colleagues. She explained how people could not believe areas like North Devon even had a homeless problem associating it with sunny holidays and second homes.  She said: “Believe it or not this is considered a deprived area round here which is really dficult to comprehend when you think of the beaches and the summer holidays but people are missing the reality of what le is like for people who live here year round. “We have a perfect storm here of a lack of industry, low paying jobs, zero hour contracts and a very low stock of social housing meaning people cannot afford to buy. “House prices are four times the average wage down here so they are reliant on the private rented sector and that is not always reliable.” She also pointed out how some rough sleepers actively choose to live in the countryside leaving them invisible to outside support. She said: “We do have people that choose to rough sleep in rural areas, purely because it is quieter, the risks are lower and they are not as open to abuse. Some of them can be very self sufficient. “I think a lot of the resources are focused on cities because it so visual there butyou come down here on holiday you don’t see it as much but actually we really have high numbers here and then others we are not aware of – we rely heavily on people like the Forestry Commission and farmers for tips about where people have set-up shop. “People need to realise that rural homelessness is happening, you may not see it, but it is all around you.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit glaring theresa kicks vote","story":"NewsBrexit: Glaring Theresa May kicks vote back as far as MARCH after robust Brussels talksIt could be weeks before glaring Theresa May goes to Brussels again after EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker rebuffed her bid to reopen talks on the -page orce dealShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video theresa-may-refuses-to-smile-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailStony-faced Theresa May kicked MPs Brexit vote back as far as MARCH today after struggling through robust talks with Brussels. EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker rebuffed her bid to reopen talks on the -page Brexit deal - including a controversial backstop. So the pair have now arranged further talks - but only before the end of February. And questioned today, a No spokeswoman refused to rule out putting a revised deal to MPs in March - which would be just weeks before the UK leaves the EU on March .   Instead the No spokeswoman said: Were working to bring it back as soon as possible. Mrs May, whose convoy was ambushed by anti-Brexit protester, pointedly did not raise a smile as she arrived and shook hands with Mr Juncker at EU headquarters.  She also held talks with EU Parliament chiefs Guy Verhofstadt and Antonio Tajani, and EU Council President Donald Tusk - who said yesterday there was a special place in hell for Tory Brexiteers. She confronted Tusk over his hell remark, telling reporters it caused widespread dismay.But despite just  days being left to Brexit, it is believed Mrs May put forward no specic solutions today to break the deadlock. She told Mr Juncker she will continue to seek legally binding changes to the -page Brexit deal. Yet Mr Juncker made clear that the EU will not reopen talks on the deal.  Mrs May has promised MPs a general vote next Thursday  February which will let them direct the way forward. But this is not the same as a meaningful vote to pass or defeat her Brexit plan, with legal effect. Now, with talks on deadlock, there are fears that meaningful vote will only be held weeks before the UK leaves the EU.   One government source told the Mirror they feared the clock ticking down as late as March  before a deal is struck. And a joint statement issued by Mrs May and Mr Juncker today did not commit to a firm timeframe. The discussion was robust but constructive, the statement said. Despite the challenges, the two leaders agreed that their teams should hold talks as to whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK Parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European Council.  The Prime Minister and the President will meet again before the end of February to take stock of these discussions. BrexitSecretary Stephen Barclay and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier will also meet next Monday. The statement confirmed Mrs May set out MPs demands for a legally binding change to the backstop - an insurance clause that would keep the UK trapped under EU customs rules. Yet Mr Juncker underlined that the EU will not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, which contains the backstop. Instead he is only willing to negotiate the separate political declaration, which spells out future trade. In a glimmer of hope, EU Parliament Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt said the political declaration could be upgraded to make it more binding.  He told reporters: Our proposal is to try to solve the problem in the political declaration. We are open as Parliament from Day One to upgrade this political declaration to make this political declaration more binding, more precise. Also on the issue of the backstop, explaining and saying very clearly that this is an insurance, not more than that. Mr Verhofstadt added that Mrs May assured him there is no question to remove a backstop. Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn has offered Theresa May a way out of the mess.  Labours leader vowed to back her deal -she guarantees a full customs union with the EU. But Mrs May has already said she does not want a customs union, meaning the offer is unlikely to be taken up. And the big offer has enraged some Labour MPs who want Mr Corbyn to back a second referendum instead. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer was forced to intervene after a backlash, insisting the Labour leaders letter did not take the prospect of a public vote off the table.

Nightclub worker Stephen Waterson, , said he would not be told what to do by a three-year-old, Londons Old Bailey was told. It is alleged that Waterson became annoyed at the cries of his partners son, Alfie Lamb, and twice pushed his chair into him. The incident occurred during a journey in his Audi convertible back to his home in Croydon, south London, in February last year. Waterson, son of former government minister Nigel Waterson, has denied Alfies manslaughter, along with his girlfriend Adrian Hoare. Hoare, , is alleged to have failed to prevent the tragedy.  Giving evidence in court, Hoare said her son was tired and moaning after a shopping trip to Sutton, south London, on February , . On the journey home, there were six people in Watersons Audi, including two children in the rear footwell. Hoare, who was in the back seat with Alfie, said the tot was irritable and tired and made it known he was uncomfortable. When Waterson first moved his front seat back, the youngster called out Mummy but was still moving about, jurors heard. Hoare asked him to go forward again, the court was told.  The hairdresser said: When he first moved the chair back Alfie was still moving about and had room so I did not think there was a problem. He was just calling Mummy. It obviously made Alfie uncomfortable with the amount of space he did have. Stephen got annoyed with him. He shouted at Alfie and told him to shut up. It made him jump when Stephen shouted at him and he started to cry more. Alfie had got louder when he got scared at Stephen shouting and obviously Stephen being annoyed was quite loud as well. After he said that he did not have room for his legs, he made another comment along the lines he was not being told what to do by a three-year-old because we asked for the chair to be moved, and he moved his chair back again.  The defendant said she never thought Alfie was in danger or in trouble and assumed when he stopped crying and went quiet that he had fallen asleep. On arriving at Watersons address in Adams Way, Alfie went all floppy, jurors heard. Hoare said: Everybody thought he was playing to start with. He was just all floppy, but hes done it before when he has not wanted to do something. He would muck about and not respond. After paramedics were called, Waterson left the scene, jurors heard. The court has been told that the defendants went on to lie to authorities about what happened.  Hoare, originally from Gravesend, Kent, denies manslaughter, child cruelty and common assault on Emily Williams, who was also in the car. Waterson has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and intimidation of the driver Marcus Lamb. The couple and Williams have pleaded guilty to conspiring to pervert the course of justice by making  statements to police.

Adrian Cook said he tried to contact Amber’s mum, Kelly Peat, following the -year-old’s disappearance. He hadn’t seen her for more than two years after the family moved home without telling him. But when Mr Cook discovered Amber had vanished on social media and called a number on her missing persons poster, he claimed he got hold of stepdad Danny Peat who he said told him: “She is not your f ***ing daughter. She wants nothing to do with you. You are nothing but a sperm donor.”  Amber stormed out of her home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, in May  after being ordered to clean out a cool box. She was found hanged in a hedgerow three days later. An inquest into her death has heard claims the teenagers treatment at home might amount to emotional abuse and that she was subjected to a series of draconian punishments – including being told to wash every pot in the kitchen - for ‘undesirable behaviour’. Mr Cook gave evidence to the Nottingham hearing on its ninth day after deciding to attend in person. It was originally only intended a statement from him would be read. He told coroner Laurinda Bower how he and Kelly met around  and had two children before splitting on Christmas Eve , when he moved out of the family home in Derbyshire.  Mr Cook said he last saw his children in early , when Amber was , and took them for a meal in a pub. He claimed she was ‘happy and cheerful’ – until he said he had to take her home. Asked by Ms Bower why that was the final time he saw them, Mr Cook replied: “My shts were all over the place. “I tried to ring Kelly and said I would be off this week, and Kelly said I could not see them at the drop of a hat. “I would ring and it would be, ‘we are going here’, or ‘we are going there’. “Every time I phoned her it would be ‘inconvenient’. There would be ‘family business’ to see to, or ‘we are taking them here, or there’.  “The last time was a heated discussion. It was getting to the point where you are beaten down by it. I wanted to see the children.” Mr Cook said that during their last conversation, Kelly told him: “You just can’t see them when you want to.” The inquest heard he considered talking to a solicitor, but didn’t feel he ‘had a leg to stand on’. At some point around March , he went to their home – but found it was empty. Mr Cook said: “I went to a friends’ house on the estate, but they said that one morning they woke up and they had upped and gone. I had no idea where they’d gone.”  He added the next contact he had with the Peats was on the day after Amber disappeared. Mr Cook told the hearing: “I found out in Facebook so I tried to contact Kelly with the number off the missing person posters. “I got vile abuse off Danny – ‘she is not your f ** daughter, she wants nothing to do with you, you are nothing but a sperm donor. “I phoned back again and spoke to Danny’s mum. I didn’t get much information. I was in deep shock about it.” He added he didn’t know about any issues surrounding his daughter that the inquest had heard about, including her running away from home previously and problems at school. Mr Cook’s mum Jenner Lancaster – Amber’s grandmother – then gave evidence. She described her granddaughter as a ‘lovely, sweet, lovable child’ who ‘liked to cuddle and play silly girly things like dressing up, and with her make-up bag’. Mrs Lancaster said she saw Amber ‘quite frequently’ when she was young – but when her son and Kelly split up she only saw her ‘two or three’ times before her death.  One of the occasions was Valentines’ Day in , when Danny wanted to cook Kelly a ‘romantic meal’ and the children went to stay with her for the weekend. But Mrs Lancaster said Amber was ‘weepy’ because she had overheard a conversation between Kelly and her mum, Dianne Gillibrand, in which they had said she ‘wouldn’t want them.’ Mrs Lancaster said: “I told them I would always want them. How can you not want two little children like that, that give you so much pleasure  “It struck me as odd.” Mrs Lancaster next saw the young siblings on Mother’s Day , but they couldn’t stop for long because Kelly was waiting in her car outside. She gave them a pair of charm bracelets, and expected to see them again before she went into hospital that April for a knee operation – but never did. She told the hearing: “I got a message from Kelly to say they loved the bracelets, and that was it. “I bought them Easter eggs and sent a message to seethey would be coming for them. And I wanted to get Amber a birthday present because I was going in hospital. But the messagewas, ‘don’t know, not sure’. That was it.” Mrs Lancaster added that she went to the family home in a bid to see them – but found they had moved. When she contacted Kelly to ask for the new address – only to be told: “I am not comfortable with you having it.” She said: “I thought, ‘this is really strange’, but that is the way it was.”  Mrs Lancaster found out Amber had gone missing through her sister, and ‘panicked’. She said she had no concerns about her granddaughter’s behaviour, and what had happened ‘came as a shock’. Referring to the Peats, she said: “They trust you with their kids and then stop you seeing them, and the next thing you know she is missing. “It’s horrible, it really is horrible. “I phoned Kelly’s number and Danny answered, and I said, ‘where is my granddaughter ’ I said I need to speak to Kelly. He said, ‘she does not want anything to do with that side of the family.’ So what do you do ” Pausing to wipe away tears, Mrs Lancaster added: “When shepassed away, I did not even get to see her at the undertakers. They had to contact Kelly. “I did not realise until that point just how cruel she could be. And it is cruel. That is how it is.” The inquest continues.

Paying tribute, Ms Majors sister, Emily Major, , said: You can see from the pictures how beautul and stunning my sister was. She was a loving and caring parent and a brilliant mother to her three-year-old son. She had a really distinctive and infectious laugh. At the inquest, coroner Professor Paul Marks said the evidence showed Ms Majors death was an accident.   Ms Majors father, Mark David Major, said she had been looking forward to spending time on two booked holidays. He said: I think it was just an accident. She was just wanting to get her high. Ellie did not mean to take her own le and under estimated the strength of her tablets.The mum-of-one had been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a type of arthritis effecting her joints, when she was aged  and was prescribed painkillers to deal with the pain.An inquest into her death atHull Coroners Courtheard Ms Major had attempted to end her own le by overdosing on drugs in March , which resulted in her losing custody over her son. But it had taken six months for her to be assessed by mental health experts because she was not a high risk - a decision which her family said had contributed to her poor mental health.   Ms Majors social worker told the hearing that the young mum had been “at the bottom of her list” because she was at a low medium risk. She told the hearing through tears: When I found out about Ellie’s death I was following up an appointment with her. I never accepted it, and that is what has thrown me so much. When I spoke with Ellie, she reassured me that her previous attempt to take her own le was impulsive and she was very remourseful. But Ms Majors heartbroken mother Marie Mitchell, , said it was beyond her she had been deemed a low risk. She said: How they can say there is not an urgent risk for a mum who tried to take her own le is beyond me - and her first assessment only happened six months later. Service manager at the Humber NHS Trust Jo Kent had put together a report and said no lessons had been learnt since Ellie’s tragic death.  Workers at the mental health teams said that Ellie had not attended planned meetings. The family also demanded answers over why Ellie was still being given eight dferent types of medication, despite her using the drugs to take her own le previously. Mr Major said he grew concerned about his daughter when he did not receive a WhatsApp message from her. She was found dead in her home in Hessle on August , . Police Officer John Norcross found “boxes and bags of prescription drugs” across the property. PC Norcross told the hearing: There was no evidence of third party involvement or anything suspicious.  Dr Ian Richmond, consultant histopathologist, said that the medical cause of death was multiple drug toxicity. Concluding the inquest as an open conclusion, coroner Professor Paul Marks said the evidence showed Ms Majors death was an accident. He said: The evidence heard today could make me believe up to the civil standard of proof, that I am persuaded by her fathers communication, this is probably an accident. The family said they would be looking to lodge a complaint with the NHS and take things further. Her heartbroken mother Marie said: It is better than what we were expecting, but we still have a lot of unanswered questions which we couldnt ask because the GP didnt have Ellies notes in front of him.

The boy suffered serious burns to his face and arm at the Home Bargains store in Worcester on July  last year, during a parental custody dispute. His -year-old father, who cannot be identied for legal reasons, is charged with conspiring to unlawfully or maliciously cast or throw sulphuric acid on or at the boy between June  and July , with intent to burn, maim, disfigure or disable the minor, or do grievous bodily harm. A trial jury at Worcester Crown Court has already been shown dramatic CCTV allegedly of the moment of the attack, and heard how the injured child screamed I hurt after being struck.  Giving evidence in his defence for the first time on Thursday, the father was asked: In July last year, did you arrange for acid to be thrown at your son  The father, standing in the witness box wearing a white shirt and jeans and speaking through a Dari interpreter, said: No, never. He told his barrister, Phil Bradley QC, he only found out about the attack when he was arrested at his Wolverhampton home. Asked about his feelings on being detained, he told the jury: I was very shocked. Mr Bradley asked: Had you any idea that little boy was going to be attacked   The father replied no and denied knowing anyone might have been following his son with acid. He also denied telling his we she had humiliated him after the couple split on a previous occasion in , resulting in her leaving the family home with the children. He was then asked about an allegation his we repeated to jurors during her evidence, when she claimed he had spoken to an imam about killing her and the children because she had left him. Askedhe had ever asked such a question, he replied: No, I cannot even think of that. The father, originally from Afghanistan, is on trial alongside Adam Cech, , of Farnham Road, Birmingham Jan Dudi, , of Cranbrook Road, Birmingham Norbert Pulko, , of Sutherland Road, London Martina Badiova, , of Newcombe Road, Handsworth, Birmingham Saied Hussini, , of Wrottesley Road, London and Jabar Paktia, , of Newhampton Road, Wolverhampton.  They all deny the same charge. When the clip from a Home Bargains shop camera was played to jurors last week, the boys father held a tissue to his face. Opening the prosecution case, Jonathan Rees QC said the boys mother had driven to the store with her children at about pm to buy a party gt. CCTV, which has been played in court, showed her being followed by a silver Vauxhall Vectra, allegedly containing Cech, Dudi and Pulko. At .pm she and the children went inside the store, followed shortly after by three men, with shop CCTV apparently showing Cech approaching the victim.  The victim was standing with his sibling near a display of toy footballs when a man in a white T-shirt, identied without dispute in court as Cech, walked past the victim with his arm extended and an object in his hand. As Cech exited the frame, the victim could be seen looking quickly back towards him before running to his mother nearby. Mr Rees told jurors: What you have just seen is that person in a white T-shirt - you can just catch the moment where the arm is extended. That really is the hub of this case. That is the acid attack. It is over in a split second. The boy suffered a cm burn to his left forearm, and a cm burn on his forehead, which needed specialist hospital treatment. The Crown has also claimed that Hussini, Pulko and Badiova were involved in an aborted attempt near a school eight days before the shop attack.  Jurors have also been shown what the prosecution described as some stickers being sent with mots and images, from the victims father to Paktia, later on the evening after the attack, including one which read Nailed It!The first showed a cartoon image of what appeared to be a deer, leaning over and comforting a tearful fox. Mr Rees said: At .pm, hesends Paktia a sticker. One animal comforting a fox which has its head in its hands.  And then, the second is sent, a minute after that first one, again to Paktia. It is a sticker which features a young lady in it with the mot Nailed It!. Jurors have been told by the prosecution that Cech and Pulkos mobile phones had both been manually reset to factory settings before being seized by police. The trial continues.

The moment had been a long time coming for Mr Whaley who travelled from his home in Chalfont St Peter in Buckinghamshire to the facility in Switzerland with we Ann, adopted children Alix and Dominic, and some close friends. But before the -year-old took his last breath surrounded by his loved ones, there was one final thing he needed to do - publish a haunting letter he hoped would be his legacy.He titled it: By the time you read this, I will be dead and addressed it to all Members of Parliament urging them to change the law surrounding assisted suicide .  No family should ever have to endure the torment we have undergone in recent weeks, the retired accountant wrote. But it will be easier to bear knowing that by sharing it we can contribute to future change. Mr Whaley, a grandfather-of-four, was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease, an incurable, terminal illness, in . As the years passed he lost the use of his limbs. His ability to speak, swallow and breath also began to rapidly deteriorate. However, he knew the worst was still to come which is why he chose to die in Switzerland rather than face immense suffering in the end stages of the devastating condition.He admitted to the BBC : This is one of the illnesses you wouldnt wish on your worst enemy.  But not only was Mr Whaley crippled by the disease in his final weeks, he says he suffered immense anguish at the hands of police and social services who were tipped off about Mr Whaleys plans. Mrs Whaley, , found herself being interviewed under caution by Thames Valley Police. And Mr Whaley said the added stress of police involvement had destroyed everything we had done to prepare ourselves. He wrote: I was saying my final goodbyes and preparing myself for the end, the final, biggest bomb dropped and I could no longer keep it together.   This bomb was in fact an anonymous phone call to social services who informed the police of my plans to go to Switzerland. Within hours Ann and I were facing a criminal investigation. The thought that I might not make it to Switzerland, or that,I did, Ann might be facing  years in jail for helping me, was almost too much to bear. Mrs Whaley, , who supported her husbands decision, told the BBC it was the first time in their  years of marriage that she had ever seen her husband cry. He said everything that Ive worked for to protect you has all been blown apart by this anonymous phone call, she said.   I wasnt frightened because I didnt feel like Id done anything wrong. I wasnt ashamed. I was cross. There was a policewoman and a detective sergeant and they were clearly not expecting to find a non-abusive situation because they were very embarrassed about the whole thing. Helping someone commit suicide is punishable by up to  years in prison. Mrs Whaley booked the flights to Switzerland and a hotel because her husband could no longer use his hands. It was so ridiculous to put us through this when he is in the final few days of le, she said. Police have since dropped the case, but the couple want to see the law changed to allow assisted dying in some circumstances.  They believe the law can be written to ensure vulnerable people are still protected from abuse. Mrs Whaley admitted: I just want him to be here, but I know what he has chosen to do is the right thing for him.I wouldnt put an animal through what he would go throughhe went to the end. At least three Britons have faced a police investigation after ing from a loved ones assisted death at a Dignitas clinic, the Times reported, although no-one has been prosecuted. When askedhe is concerned about the consequences his we could face, Mr Whaley, who spent his last night having dinner with his family at a hotel in Zurich, replied: Ann can handle anything. The one thing that has worried me all along is leaving Ann because Ive spent all my le protecting her. Now shell be without me, but I know shell get through it. Mr Whaleys letter to MPs in full: Dear Members of Parliament, By the time you read this, I will be dead. On Thursday th February , I will have taken medication that will end my le, surrounded by my we, Ann, my children, Alix and Dominic, and a couple of my dearest friends at the Dignitas facility in Switzerland. With their love and support I have been able to fulfil my final wish: to be in control of my end, rather than endure the immense suffering motor neurone disease had in store for me. I want to impress upon you the anguish me and my family have experienced, not because of this awful illness , but because of the law against assisted dying in this country. The blanket ban on assisted dying has not only forced me to spend thousands of pounds and endure months of logistical hurdles in order to secure a peaceful and dignied death overseas, but it has meant that my final weeks of le have been blighted by visits from social services and police. Since my diagnosis of MND, an incurable, terminal illness, in , I felt as though bombs have been dropping on me. I gradually lost the use of all four limbs. My ability to speak, swallow and breathe began rapidly deteriorating. I knew my death was inevitable and unavoidable, but I remained strong for my family. I am  years old and have lived a full le. I did not fear death, but I did fear the journey. I simply wanted to cut this suffering short by a few months. When I eventually got the ‘green light’ from Dignitas, a weight lted I was able to get on with living without the constant mental anguish over my death. But then, as I was saying my final goodbyes and preparing myself for the end, the final, biggest bomb dropped and I could no longer keep it together. This bomb was in fact an anonymous phone call to social services who informed the police of my plans to go to Switzerland. Within hours Ann and I were facing a criminal investigation. The thought that I might not make it to Switzerland, or that,I did, Ann might be facing  years in jail for helping me, was almost too much to bear. In  years of marriage, Ann had not seen me cry. The day we were contacted by the police, I sobbed. The law in this country robbed me of control over my death. It forced me to seek solace in Switzerland. Then it sought to punish those attempting to help me get there. The hypocrisy and cruelty of this is astounding. Though it is perfectly legal for me make arrangements and travel to Dignitas by myself, the minute anyone  ‘assists’ me in any way – which is essential, due to my condition – they are liable for prosecution. I had the chance, just over a week before my death, to speak to some MPs and Peers about my experience and my adamant wish that the law should be changed. The overwhelming reaction in the room was one of agreement however, I am aware that despite huge public support for an assisted dying law, most members of parliament currently oppose it. I spoke to one MP who had voted against the last assisted dying Bill in . The law being proposed was limited to terminally ill, mentally competent adults in their final months, with strict inbuilt safeguards to protect the vulnerable and anyone  who has not made a clear decision of their own volition. When I pressed her on why she felt people like me should be denied a say over our own death and be forced to suffer, she was unable to articulate an answer. I want MPs to know that change is urgently needed and that it is achievable – over  million people in several American and Australian states and across Canada are covered by assisted dying laws which allow choice to dying people and protection to others. No family should ever have to endure the torment we have undergone in recent weeks, but it will be easier to bear knowing that by sharing it we can contribute to future change. I sincerely hope that you will truly listen to our story and see the suffering you are inflicting by upholding the status quo.

Hollie Baker ran off laughing after she zapped acquaintance Lee Pearson with the illegal stun gun, leaving him writhing on the ground in agony. Lee, , was stopped in the street by Baker, , who came up from behind him and blasted him in the back with the shock weapon. Lee had known Baker for about a year as they lived in the same area of Maidstone, Kent.   He told Maidstone Crown Court that one of the ways his Aspergers syndrome presents itself is that Lee unconsciously stands uncomfortably close to people hes chatting with, and fixes them with his gaze. He said: I wasnt standing close to her. I was talking to her about my Aspergers syndrome. The next thing I knew she tasered me on the back. I was terried. I ran down the road and called the police.

Nine-year-old Khushpreet Kaur was left screaming in agony in the freak accident that tore off large parts of her scalp. The youngsters head was torn apart by a tractors crop spraying machine in rural India .She was sitting on top of her uncles tractor, when her dress got caught, dragging her helplessly towards the machinery. Her dress became tangled up in the spinning sprayer, which led to her hair getting caught and wound around its rotating parts. Her hair was pulled clean from her head.   The horric ordeal happened on November  last year when Khushpreet was riding on top of her uncles tractor in Dharampura village in Punjab, India. He was watering a field of orange orchards when he discovered his niece covered in blood and missing half her scalp. She was rushed to hospital km away in Bathinda, where surgeons performed an eight hour long operation to reattach her forehead and scalp.   Aspiring school teacher, Khushpreet, spent  days recovering in intensive care at the Cosmo Superspeciality Hospital following the operation. She has now fully recovered and her hair is beginning to grow back. Lead cosmetic surgeon, Dr Raman Goyal, says he had to cancel other operations to prioritise Khushpreets urgent medical emergency.   He said: Khushpreets complete scalp and the skin of her forehead had peeled off in the accident. As soon as she was brought in we decided to conduct micro vascular repair of the scalp and reattach the same. The complex surgery lasted for about eight hours. He added that this type of scalp re-plant was one of the rare plastic surgeries to be conducted in the country.

Her sweet Giovanna had always had a small pot belly, but watching her train, she could see her stomach was clearly jutting out. And later, when feeling the schoolgirls protruding stomach, she was shocked to find what appeared to be a five-month baby bump. I fretted, imagining the worst, Ange recalled. With her daughters stomach rock hard, she began asking herself terrying questions, like whether the teen could have been assaulted. But it would later turn out that Giovanna wasnt expecting. Instead, she had silent killer oian cancer - with the mystery bump actually a football-sized tumour on her oy.And in July , despite gruelling chemotherapy, Giovanna peacefully passed away, surrounded by her heartbroken family. The courageous teen had only recently turned . Our daughter is the bravest, strongest, most beautul person I ever knew, Ange, from Merbein, Australia, toldtoday. And I am so proud and honoured that she chose me to be her mum. In a message to other parents, she added: Always talk with your children about their health and being aware of changes in their body.  Have the dialogue open and teach them that they can advocate for their health. Education is key in our children learning more about their bodies as well as silent illnesses that can arise. Bubbly Giovanna, known affectionately as G, had been taking part in netball training when her coach approached her mum. She asked her, Is Giovanna pregnant , leaving her furious.In a beautul letter to her daughter, published on Kidspot , Ange recalls: What the hell  She’s only a kid! I fumed inwardly.But that night, the mum gently asked her daughter whether she could feel her stomach - and discovered the apparent baby bump. Putting my hands on your stomach, it felt like a five-month baby bump and hard as a rock, she writes in the letter.  The following day, Giovanna was taken to the doctors, where she did a pregnancy test before being rushed for an ultrasound. The scan revealed her enormous growth. And later, after undergoing surgery to remove her -kilo tumour, the brave teenager was diagnosed with oian cancer. They removed her oy along with a kg tumour, Ange told us. Giovanna recovered in hospital for the next five days. By this time disbelief had worn off and we were all upbeat about going home, and of course Giovanna was over the moon with her now new figure and flat tummy. [But on] May , , we were rushed down to Melbourne to be told Giovanna had oian cancer. The schoolgirl, who had undergone the operation at Victorias Royal Childrens Hospital, subsequently underwent chemotherapy.  She had her first round of treatment on her th birthday. While her main concern was the thought of losing her hair, her mum feared that she may not be able to have children in the future. Little did we know this was not our main concern, Ange said. She added: All she wanted for her birthday was a party with all her friends, so two weeks after her chemo  of her best friends joined her in celebrating her th birthday. She said afterwards that it was the best night of her le. I am so glad and thankful that we did this, it is even more special now as it was to be her last birthday. Giovanna, who had also been suffering from tiredness before her diagnosis, was rushed back to hospital at the end of May .  She was in agonising pain, with her stomach growing once again. And this time, it swelled to the size of a nine-month baby bump. I even had to buy you a pair of size- pyjama pants, Ange, who also has a son, Nando, writes in her touching letter to her daughter. After spending a week at Royal Childrens Hospital, Giovanna was transferred to the Royal Womens Hospital in Parkville, Melbourne. Despite medics best efforts, her organs began shutting down and she was sedated to ease her pain, as her family stayed beside her. And at .pm on July , the schoolgirl lost her courageous battle, as her distraught mum sobbed: Go darling, fly with the angels. Her final, selfless wish was for her family to raise money to fund Ronald McDonald Houses, which provide a home away from home for seriously ill children and their loved ones.   Today, Ange and her husband Fred are living every persons worst nightmare, suffering from a dull ache that is constantly present.But in honour of their beloved daughter, they have set up Giovannas Gt , a charity which raises awareness and money for oian cancer research and Ronald McDonald Houses.The couple, who are determined to make sure no-one  has to walk in their shoes, fund a room at the Ronald McDonald House in Parkville in memory of Giovanna. And they also raise much-needed funds for teenagers with cancer who at times are the forgotten ones when it comes to gts and items of need.   They are desperate to spare other families the same pain they are going through. Oian cancer, the silent killer, is not so well known as its cousin, breast cancer, yet can be far more dangerous, Ange said. Oian cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women, but its symptoms can be dficult to recognise.According to the NHS , they include a swollen stomach, feeling constantly bloated, stomach or pelvic discomfort, feeling full quickly when eating, and needing to urinate more often than normal.

That happens with late goals but we still have to take confidence because it still was a good performance.“I came in two weeks ago and we had five new boys on the deadline.“They’ve only trained once so it was always going to be hard but in periods of the game you could see we can all play together and how it can come off.“Hopefully, we can show more of that in the upcoming games.“It’s always disappointing to concede a last-minute goal but I think the boys worked their socks off. The performance might not have been as good as against Motherwell and Hearts but every one of us certainly put everything in.“Unfortunately, a strike like that happens and you can’t do anything about it.”Despite only signing for the Dark Blues on January , Dales has already featured five times for the club and is set for his sixth turn-out in tonight’s clash at home to high-flying Kilmarnock.It’s been a non-stop start to le at Dens Park for the -year-old who is enjoying le already in the Scottish top flight and is hoping to experience his first victory in dark blue in just over  hours’ time.He added: “I think I’ve settled in quite well.“It’s definitely dferent up here, it’s a lot quicker, up and down all the time but I think that suits me.“That’s my game, to be dynamic, so I think it probably suits me more up here than down in League One.“I’ve only been here a couple of weeks and I’ve already played four-and-a-half games in two weeks.“Some of the others have played five so it has been pretty thick and fast butwe can put another good performance on again I think we can get the three points.“It’s a great opportunity to do that as long as we work as hard as we did on Saturday. If all the lads put in % like that I don’t see why we can’t get the three points.”Despite coming in from mid-table League One side Scunthorpe to join Dundee’s push to avoid relegation from the Premiership, Dales says he’s up for the challenge.“Some people prefer to go into a promotion-chasing team but, for me, there’s nothing wrong with being in a relegation battle.“I’m up for that and I think every single player in the changing-room is definitely up for it.“With the quality we have and,we can keep showing that for most of the game, there’s no reason why we can’t get to where we should be.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c593edc5c5222.30407689.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds ian harkes is making his dundonian grandad very happy","story":"He had never been to the city before signing for Dundee United and, despite being born down south, Ian Harkes was so young when his family headed back to America he has no memory of his year or two in Britain.However, family ties mean moving to Dundee has been something of a homecoming for the -year-old American.As was well-documented when he signed up last month, grandad James is a Dundonian and was delighted when Ian told him he was joining boyhood heroes United.That made his impressive home debut against Morton at the weekend a special moment not just for Ian but his family back in the States and, in particular, James, who was born a stone’s throw away in Fleming Gardens.For Ian, though, just as special as those family ties is the fact he’s now playing his football in a city and country where football isn’t just a sport, it’s a way of le.“It was good to be in for my home debut at Tannadice and I thought my energy was good,” he said.“I spoke to my grandad a couple of weeks ago and he was over the moon at me signing and I’ll be speaking to him again soon because I’m sure he was delighted about me playing at Tannadice.“The whole family caught the game I think and they were pleased. I actually don’t have any relatives here in Dundee because they all moved to America but I’m sure they will be over soon to watch me in person.”And the former DC United man admits being in an environment where the population live and breathe football is a special feeling.His grandad’s love of United and the fact dad John, a former USA skipper, spent a big chunk of his career in England, means that’s not come as a surprise.“Over here everyone talks about football all the time and it’s the culture. It’s everywhere, which I love, and it’s all over the city.“There are so many competing sports back in the US that are big but football is getting bigger and at the final this year in Atlanta you saw , people there and that is great to see. The game is going to keep growing there and you will see more and more players coming through but here it’s on a dferent level.“I knew what it was like over here, I got it from my dad from when he was here. My mum and dad talked about it a lot, how everyone is immersed in the sport.“I get in taxis here and they are talking about it and all the people are. I love that.”For Ian, though, just being able to experience le in a football-mad country is not going to be enough.He’s come to United to progress his career and that means helping get them back to the Premiership and making a name for himself at that level.With the squad Robbie Neilson has put together, that’s a goal he’s convinced he will achieve.“There’s a lot of new guys in the squad and I thought you saw us start off well against Morton,” he added.“You also saw glimpses in the second half where we had to finish off the game and get that third goal and we didn’t.“However, I think in the first half the guys were moving the ball around well and getting into good positions.“Pete Pawlett was coming inside for us and Pav Safranko was stretching them. That got us the space to play and I think we got a bit away from that in the second half but it will come.“If we keep going and show our class we will finish off games a bit better.“I think, like the manager has said, there are a lot of good players who have good experience so when they get in, they just gel.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c5ac61f76f544.56248025.jpg ","title":"free cash folk throughout dundee perthshire and fife in line for cold weather payment are you eligible","story":"People throughout Dundee are in line to receive cash after the recent bout of cold weather.The Government#s Cold Weather Payment scheme dishes out £ to people living in an area where the average temperature has been C or below for seven consecutive days.Every person living in the DD postcodes endured these conditions between January  and February , it has been confirmed.Folk in Perthshire and Fe are also in line to receive a windfall due to the cold weather.Click here to seeyou are eligible."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c5ac44ce1b223.17849600.jpg ","title":"jealous dundee man pinned ex against wall after she was dropped off by another man","story":"A jealous ex-boyfriend pinned a woman against a door after she was dropped off by another man.William Petrie, of Wentworth Place, saw red after seeing Sarah Docherty leave her friend’s car near her parents’ home.Dundee Sherf Court heard that Ms Docherty fell through a front door as a result of Petrie’s assault.The pair had previously been in a relationship for five years but separated within the last  months.At around pm on Saturday, Ms Docherty arrived at her parents’ house on Ladywell Avenue after being dropped off by a male friend.Petrie had driven to the street at the same time and, according to fiscal depute Kirsten Letford, “took umbridge” at his ex-partner being dropped off by another man.She said: “As a result, an argument ensued and she went towards the front door of the property on Ladywell Avenue and the accused followed her.“She expected the door to be unlocked but it was locked and the accused caught up with her and spun her around so she was facing him.“He then placed both of his hands on her neck and pinned her against the door while shouting towards her.”Ms Docherty’s mother was inside at the time and, after hearing the commotion, she unlocked the door – causing Ms Docherty to fall backwards into the house,” said Ms Letford.She managed to get inside and locked the door but Petrie continued to shout outside as well as ringing the doorbell demanding to be let in.Police were contacted and after being cautioned and charged, Petrie said: “I know I had my hands around her throat.

That could change in Saturday’s Scottish Cup visit to St Mirren and at the very least he will provide experienced cover for Benjamin Siegrist.Charlie SeamanIt was a dficult start for the Bournemouth kid as he made his debut in the defeat at Ayr United just hours after flying north to begin his loan. The -year-old, however, did reasonably well at Somerset Park and looked good as he made his home debut in Saturday’s win over Morton.Mark ReynoldsThe vastly-experienced Aberdeen defender showed his ability and know-how as he strolled through his debut against the Ton, despite injury meaning that was his first competitive outing since last May. Reynolds was handed the captain’s armband and showed leadership qualities that could prove vital in the coming months.Mark ConnollyThe arrival from Crawley Town is another centre-half and Saturday saw him show instant signs of being able to form a solid partnership with Reynolds. The Irishman is a no-nonsense defender who looks perfect for the physical requirements of the Championship.Calum ButcherBack for a second spell at United having previously played at Tannadice under Jackie McNamara, the midfielder was brought in to add bite in that area of the park. He lasted an hour at the weekend and in that time won his tackles and had a big influence on those around him in the middle of the park.Ian HarkesThe -year-old American was something of a surprise arrival but with his energetic box-to-box running has shown why Robbie Neilson wanted him. The former DC United team-mate of Wayne Rooney covered a lot of ground and, as he showed in the Scottish Cup win at Montrose, also has a goal in him.Morgaro GomisAnother who is ing to United, in his case for a third spell in tangerine. Gomis blotted his copy book by picking up a red card in that defeat at Ayr. Now , the  Scottish Cup winner is unlikely to start every game but will provide good cover in central midfield.Peter PawlettThe manager spent most of last month working to secure the services of the former Aberdeen man who played for him at MK Dons. Pawlett wasted no time showing why with a superb debut against Morton that saw him grab his first United goal. His pace, use of the ball and movement off it means he will be a very big player.Cammy SmithThe third of the arrivals who have played for United before. Smith has fitted in well since joining up from St Mirren. He goes about his work in quietly but his knowledge of how to win promotion from this ision makes him an asset.Aidan NesbittAnother who played for Neilson at MK Dons. The former Celtic kid has signed until the end of the season and so far only one of his five appearances have been as a starter. At , the attacker could be one for the future –he can add goals to the nice touches seen so far.Osman SowAnother ex-MK Don and the Swedish striker also played for Neilson during a successful spell at Hearts. The -year-old has had a lack of game time buthe can get his match fitness back quickly there is no question he has the ability to get goals in this ision."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"customers-overpaying-for-unused-mobile-data-7-ways-to-avoid-it","story":"MOST mobile customers on SIM-only deals are overpaying for unused data, Citizens Advice has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"alex-salmond-holyrood-committee-convened-by-linda-fabiani-must-show-no-bias","story":"MSPs have voted to establish a Holyrood committee to investigate the Scottish Governments handling of complaints against Alex Salmond."},{"url":null,"title":"anniesland-emergency-services-on-the-scene-at-muirkirk-drive","story":"POLICE Scotland has confirmed officers are at the scene of an incident in Anniesland."},{"url":null,"title":"brendan-rodgers-confirms-scott-bain-has-celtic-gloves-for-now","story":"Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers has confirmed that Scott Bain has the number one short at the Parkhead side for now.

In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

Now the proposition has got a whole lot dferent. Pet Heaven, a crematorium for family animals, has just opened in Ayr. And businessman Forbes Robertson believes it is the answer for many families who want to give their four legged - or two-legged in the case of birds - friends a splendid send-off. No expense has been spared in an -month project at the former commercial garage site in West Sanquhar Road. Area MP Bill Grant performed the official opening ceremony last week. The lavishly decorated gilded interior includes a parlour where families can pay their last respects. Entrepreneur Forbes, who has business interests throughout the area, revealed up to  people can attend the pet funeral services . Mourners can watch as their pet recedes behind the final curtain at the close of the service, similar to what would happen in a human ceremony at Masonhill. As yet Pet Heaven cannot handle horses, but the biggest of dogs to cats, hamsters and birds. There is a tea and coffee service as well as any choice of music desired and a book of remembrance in the reception area.  Much of the interior decoration has been gathered by Forbes, a keen antique hunter and auction room collector. The company will offer a collection service as well as provide a selection of remembrance urns for ashes. It seems no expense is spared by some dog lovers in the UK and recently a couple spent pound on a full funeral including a horse drawn glass hearse. Forbes said: “People sometimes care more about their animals than humans. “A farmer who contacted me askedhis dog goes before him, the animal would be cremated here and I will store the ashes. “He told me his lawyer would be in touch as he wanted buried with his dog. “Pets are loyal, they don’t steal from you and are there first thing in the morning and last thing at night.” MP Bill Grant said Pet Heaven was a signicant investment for the area. He said: “I am sure this will be welcomed by pet owners from all over the southwest, pet owners who have lost their best friend. “To have a dignied departure for that pet who has been their friend - in some cases for  years - is a great service. “The set-up Mr Robertson has here is wonderful and I think he can be proud of it. “That last journey for pets will be full of dignity and respect from Pet Heaven and its staff. “Indeed my family had a wee dog Blackie for  years and I don’t mind admitting, then a senior fire officer, that I cried unashamedly for an hour at the loss of our companion”.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrPetsSanquharAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"piping hot performance ayr stars","story":"NewsPiping hot performance from Ayr starsAyr Pipe Band Society took to the stage to support the world-renowned bagpipe band Red Hot Chilli Pipers.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  FEB NewsAyr Pipe Band Society gear up to support Red Hot Chilli Pipers at Ayr Town Hall \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPiping stars joined together to wow crowds at a top show in Ayr’s Town Hall.

most money was declared Candlemas King or Queen and they ruled for six weeks.They had the power to make one whole afternoon a week a playtime and to excuse anyone they wished from any form of

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

That is exactly what she is doing. For the last two years she has put Scotlandrsquos constitutional issues to the side and pushed for Scotland and the UK to remain within the customs union and single market. All and any analysis I have read has given that outcome as being in the best economic interests of the UK and Scotland, but Ms Sturgeon, the Scottish Government and Scotlandrsquos Parliament have all been dismissed with contempt.The May Government is only interested in the Tory party and the DUP. The EU has proved extremely flexible in dealing with Mmember territories in or out of the EU, so it was possible Scotland and Northern Ireland could have had a dferent status to England Wales but was never asked. Indeed it has been reported that London insisted to the EU that Scotland be denied sharing in any dferentiation on offer to others.Mr Redfern advocates for what he calls the ldquoMay compromise: trouble is that Theresa May changes the parameters of her deal on a daily basis. Donrsquot believe me ndash ask her own Tory MPs. It is the Tories who have led us to this clf edge, and it will be the Tories who tip us into the abyss. Scotland voted to stay in the EU but has zero status or leverage within the UK ldquoUnion. Ireland is respected and her interests are being protected in the EU Union. The dference is stark and should be an example to any Scot with an ounce of gumption.GR Weir, Mill Street, Ochiltree.ROBIN Gilmourdraws a somewhat simplistic comparison between Irelands long struggle for freedom from British rule and the UKs vote to leave the European Union.He is correct to state that the Republic of Ireland, over hundreds of years, fought against domination by Britain and eventually won its independence. However, Britains partition of Ireland, designed to keep the bulk of the Unionist population and heavy industry under the UK flag, sowed the seeds for future conflict in the north of Ireland.Our present vexatious issue with the Irish protocol has only arisen because the UKs decision to depart from the EU leaves Northern Ireland as, obviously, thanks to the partition of , the only part of the UK that shares a border with an EU country.The Irish Government and the EU are trying to work together with Theresa May and her Government to avoid future loss of le and conflict in Northern Ireland by ensuring that there is no hard border, now, and in the future.The only obstruction to Britain arriving at a solution at present appears to be from those who see the people on the island of Ireland as an irrelevance and a hindrance to a clean break with Brussels,despite  per cent of people in Northern Ireland voting to remain.Mr Gilmours exasperation displays an age-old condescending British attitude towards the Irish that I had hoped had evaporated into the mists of history. As he himself says, Ireland is an independent sovereign nation on a par with Britain.

Many of us would agree that Network Rail needs to be in the control of Scotland so that we can have a truly joined-up approach to these issues,\" said Mr Harvie.\"But we cannot wait for that.

as its predecessor. As part of the build, the project team used the opportunity to improve facilities in the village by redeveloping a derelict tennis court and constructing an enclosed children’s play park as well as additional parking for use by the school and local community.The school’s social staircase is already becoming a well-used architectural feature alongside its many other bright and airy flexible learning spaces, including the glass fronted library and learning area upstairs.Its teaching wings benefit from cleverly designed acoustics, modern set up and technology offerings in all  classrooms, and are on two levels, with lightwells connecting them.Specially commissioned artwork is also an important feature of the new school.Local artists worked with pupils to design and create a number of pieces, including a large Oak tree in the dining area symbolizing growth with leaves painted by every child.  Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said: “A great team effort has led to the delivery of an extremely high quality building on time and on budget, and we’re thankful to everyone who has played their part in that. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Erasums students question what will happen after Brexit\"  What is the future for Erasmus students after Brexit  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“It stands testament to what a community can achieve by working together, right from those dark early days after the fire when local people rallied round to offer soup and sandwiches to staff, to the lovely reception pupils received from the community in Kintore.”Chair of Education and Children’s Services Committee, Councillor Gillian Owen said: “It’s not only wonderful to see the pupils at Kinellar enjoying their new school but also to reflect on what a fantastic learning experience this project has given them.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution.

If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority.

It was due to start its final phase of construction this year but it was axed from the councilrsquos capital programme in last yearrsquos budget.Then in March, funding for transport improvements in Dingwall was found to enable some housing development to take place prior to the commencement of the KLR.A transport study and modelling work considered the impact of ious levels of development in the town and improvements will include work at the Bridgend Avenue Junction and Docharty Road Junction as well as traffic signal works at Mart Road Junction.

This project needs to be reinstated.Fellow ward councillor Angela Maclean insisted the deal was good news.

These moves are hugely intensive and provide a short-term boost for local workers and the economy. Such projects also develop the expertise and credibility of Scotland’s already impressive pool of financial services talent. : Nicola Sturgeon: Real and growing risk of no-deal BrexitHowever, that fact remains that much high-value work generated by exporting financial services to the EU is draining out of the Scottish economy permanently.On the other hand, there are new opportunities emerging as a direct result of the Brexit effect – for example firms are bringing some foreign operations back to Britain. Whilst the inward surge is not expected to match what is being lost, we are seeing a trend of UK and foreign firms relocating parts of their business to the UK to ensure they can continue to support their UK customer base. This includes many UK insurers who had previously set up offshore subsidiaries.The driver for larger UK firms moving operations to the EU is to satisfy their European customers, who are seeking assurances that there will be no disruption to their services in the event that no withdrawal deal is reached.However, some customers have raised concerns about whether they will get the same levels of consumer protection as offered in the UK – such as the protection of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.We are advising a range of organisations, including a number of high-growth, financial technology businesses, who are planning their international growth strategy with Brexit in mind. We are seeing particularly high levels of activity in the payments industry. Many expanding fintech businesses in Scotland have an ambitious global outlook.: Brexit: Queen to be evacuated in event of no-deal, reports claimIt would be much simpler for them to grow abroadthe EU wasn’t to suddenly become a ‘foreign’ jurisdiction. On the other hand, many of these firms already have processes in place to manage a truly international business. For those companies, the potential barriers to exporting financial services to EU are relatively simple to plan for.International trade in financial services is particularly restricted by the requirement of firms to be authorised to undertake regulated activities. This is why Brexit is a serious issue for the financial sector to contend with. Currently we are part of a common regulatory regime, so any firm authorised to provide financial services in one EU member state can effectively get permission to conduct business in any other member state, using a mechanism known as ‘passporting’. When we are no longer in the EU, UK firms will lose their rights to passport their permissions to the EU. UK firms will be subject to the same restrictions as other firms from where across the globe.The UK will be eligible to apply for equivalence in a limited number of regulated activities, but this process is not automatic. It requires the approval of the European Commission, which could take considerable time and be subject to political obstacles. If an equivalence is approved for the UK, there would be a requirement to maintain close alignment to the EU financial services regulations. The Commission has the discretion to withdraw their approval at any time, which would provide little certainty for UK firms.On the flipside, any EU firm wanting to trade here will have to satisfy the UK’s own rules. Even though no deal has been agreed at the moment, the UK Government has thus far given assurances that regardless of what happens we’ll continue to give EU firms the opportunity to continue trading whilst applying for UK permissions up to March . They must noty the UK regulators in advance of Brexit to get the temporary permissions, but this gives more certainty to EU firms trading here than the other way around as it stands.If we are looking for positives where there are some short-term benefits of a weaker pound, which helps keep inward investment into the UK on the radar as an appealing prospect, but there is a bigger foreign exchange risk for the future should our economy and currency value begin to erge signicantly from mainland Europe.We have been helping our clients to review their businesses in order to better understand how Brexit will affect them. In some cases, depending on their set-up, it turns out after a thorough analysis that there are few specic risks.However, the process has been useful as a prompt to look at their operations in detail to see where there could get more general business efficiencies and opportunities. That may be the one silver lining to emerge from the Brexit process, whether there are any more remains to be seen.Stuart Murdoch is a solicitor advocate and partner at Burness Paull LLP©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4869283.1549558359!/image/image.jpg","title":"why nicola sturgeon was wrong to push independence in america pamela nash","story":"Nicola Sturgeon should travel overseas to promote Scotland # but not the cause of independence, writes Pamela Nash.Scotland ‘The Brand’ is a global success story. Our world-renowned food and drink, and our manufacturing excellence, are hugely successful exports that help grow our economy.The Scottish Government is right to promote Scotland around the world, and that means that ministers must also – from time to time – travel abroad to do so. Similar trade delegations travel from the other nations and regions of the UK to promote their own local companies.Yes, it costs public money for flights and accommodation, but everyone can recognise that the resulting trade deals can, in turn, massively boost our public finances.Today, at First Minister’s Questions, SNP Deputy First Minister John Swinney stood in for Nicola Sturgeon because she is on a trip to North America.The USA is Scotland’s top export destination country with an estimated £. billion of exports from Scotland in , so this is clearly an important market for Scottish companies.Ms Sturgeon’s itinerary includes “trade and culture engagements in Washington DC, New York, New Jersey, Ottawa and Toronto” during the five-day visit.So far, so good.: Nicola Sturgeon plays down prospect of early Scottish independence voteBut the First Minister – on a trip entirely funded from the public purse to represent the whole of Scotland – also delivered a speech at Georgetown University.It was this event which attracted the most media attention, and the SNP carried her full speech on its party website.In that speech, Ms Sturgeon repeatedly highlighted her support for independence.She also talked about breaking up the UK on PBS’s flagship NewsHour current affairs TV programme.It’s clear that the First Minister used this trip not only to promote Scotland, but to promote her party’s own narrow-minded and isive pursuit of independence.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/15_9_21-Barcelona-by-Xavier-Mercade-5-Copy.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

Guest speaker, Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary, Department of Finance, will also be on hand to provide an insight into wider Programme for Government objectives.Murray Bell, President of Causeway Chamber of Commerce, the largest independent business network in the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough, discusses some of the priorities and the strength in a unied approach.“For  years the Chamber has been helping businesses of all sizes to grow their network, knowledge, influence and reach. Sitting at the heart of the local business community, the Chamber has a large and active membership from sole traders to multinational companies across all sectors totalling more than , employees. “Our relationships with others have helped us to achieve goals beyond those we could ever achieve alone. Across our network, we connect businesses locally, nationally and internationally, with other businesses, with decision-makers and with opportunities. As a respected, recognised voice for business, our opinions are regularly sought by policymakers and politicians and through our networks we have helped businesses of every size, in every sector, to thrive.“The Causeway Coast and Glens area finds itself in exciting times, with plenty of opportunity ahead, from the organic growth of tourism, to the arrival of the Golf in . We also have Northern Ireland’s first Enterprise Zone located within our region and we need to continue to promote and connect the right people to make the most of this opportunity. “To prosper we need to focus on Skills, Infrastructure and Growth. Skills shortage is consistently raised as one of the biggest issues facing our members. There are job vacancies across our towns and villages, and employers cannot fill these because of the shortage of the appropriate skills in the local economy. In many other sectors, we need to promote enterprise and apprenticeship models for schools, colleges, and universities so that students and leavers can build up their knowledge of business, better preparing them for work or to set up their own business, and we need our businesses to be ready to take on and train new people.”Murray adds: “Our Causeway Coast and Glens area, according to recent figures, is the second highest council area in terms of renewable energy production, and we need to build on this towards energy parity and then beyond to energy export. However, we suffer from poor transport and energy infrastructure and we are raising this regularly and know that our local representatives are doing the same. “We need better transport links across the Borough and we need high-quality road and faster rail infrastructure that connects Coleraine to Belfast and Derry-Londonderry, allowing people and goods to travel here and move around.”Explaining the growing importance of technology-based businesses Chamber member, Gary McClarty, Chief Executive of Coleraine based MCL InsureTech says:“Over the last ten years MCL InsureTech has become one of Ireland’s leading online insurance companies. We are passionate about everything online and we are constantly embracing new ways of working to give customers the best possible online experience. We have the technological know-how and expertise to create innovative online loyalty services that will enhance the lives of customers who choose us as their online car insurance partner. “We also market test our IT solutions in a real-time environment, enabling us to continuously improve the end result for both the consumer and business user. Our unique online insurance proposition has already enabled us to capture around € million of the motor insurance market in the Republic which equates to nearly one in every twenty vehicles. We intend to replicate this success in the Northern Ireland market and it is crucial that we can recruit skilled iniduals to help us achieve our objectives.” As part of a major expansion plan in Northern Ireland MCL InsureTech is to create  new jobs in the next  months, with a further  new jobs envisaged over the next three to five years. MCL InsureTech operates three dferent insurance brands ItsWomen.ie, BoxyMo.ie and plus.ie, as well as an IT solutions company DotSys Ltd and a media buying business B Connected Media.Staff numbers at the organisation have more than tripled over the last decade, up from  to .Hospitality and tourism is also another growth sector and ‘A Causeway Welcome’ is a new initiative being developed by Causeway Chamber to support members. One of the forthcoming developments planning to create a signicant number of jobs is the £ Million Merrow Hotel and Spa, providing  rooms, a luxury spa with sea views, a leisure club with a m pool, a glass sauna and infinity pool, a steam room, a gym and studio, a demonstration restaurant, a bar bistro restaurant, a signature cocktail bar, a conference space, meeting rooms and nine chalets serviced by the hotel.

Posting parcels to EU countries after Brexit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Local Chamber member, Vivienne Gilholm, discusses the economic benefits of the project: “A successful outcome for the team would be to create the North Coast’s first luxury seafront hotel and spa. A number of local experts collaborated on the design to ensure the end result was a hotel that was sympathetic to its surroundings. With the number of tourists to the North Coast on the increase, we wish to provide accommodation and leisure facilities to meet demand. It is hoped that groundworks will start in , creating up to  jobs locally.“With two world class golf courses on its doorstep, the Merrow has the potential to become an ideal location for golfing enthusiasts. Portstewart has an excellent links course and is frequently described as one of Northern Ireland’s hidden gems, while Royal Portrush, which will host the  Open Championship, is only a few miles away”.Mark Donnelly from Merrow Hotel and Spa explains the signicance of using a local architect to design the proposed development: “The concept for the design of the hotel was to propose a low-lying building, predominantly three storey, set within its landscape that reached out to the coast and the NW circuit, wrapped around sun-filled courtyard spaces and that could become a focal or signature building for the area. The sea views of Inishowen, North Donegal, and the Scottish islands of Islay and Jura are also an important influence in the design. The objective was to create a building that is of its time and its place, without being ostentatious.” To find out more the Chamber’s priorities and forthcoming plans, spaces are still available for the President’s Business Lunch.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

And back in the hungry s when every day was a grind to put the most basic grub on the table and keep a roof over your head, it was women like the lady opposite who you relied on to get you to your work on time.Our pictures show one of the last of the ‘knocker-uppers’ who rose well before the crack of dawn every day in le to go round the doors to give people their morning alarm call.Known as ‘The Lady With The Map’, Mary Millar plied her trade in Kells and Connor.A knocker-up was a job in Britain and Ireland that started during and lasted well into the Industrial Revolution, when alarm clocks were neither cheap nor reliable.Most had given up the role by the begnning of the s but Mary was still performing her morning task up until the outbreak of World War .  The knocker-up used a baton or short, heavy stick to knock on the clients doors or a long and light stick, often made of bamboo, to reach windows on higher floors. At least one of them used a pea-shooter!In , the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week. The knocker-up would not leave a clients window until they were sure that the client had been awoken.A knocker upper would also use a snuffer outer as a tool to rouse the sleeping. This implement was used to put out gas lamps which were lit at dusk and then needed to be extinguished at dawn.There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns. Generally the job was done by elderly men and women but sometimes police constables supplemented their pay by performing the task during early morning patrols.The pictures, re-discovered by areporter on a research task at the Local Studies Department of Ballymena Library appeared in the Belfast Newsletter in January of .

At only four-days-old Dáithí travelled to London where he underwent open heart surgery. Six days after that he underwent his second open heart operation.Máirtín described the stay as a “hard week” for his family and told the Andersonstown News that although Dáithí’s hearthasn’t declined, there had been slight damage done to his kidneys due to the high dosage of medicine the Ballymurphy toddler has to take.“It was a hard week for Dáithí, it was a hard week for us as well,” explained Máirtín. “There were constant needles, test after test for Dáithí but we got through it. The staff were amazing and the cardiologist seemed happy with Dáithí’s heartbut noticed some kidney damage.“Dáithí takes medicine for his heart, to help him go to the toilet he takes aspirin, around  doses of medicine in total a week. The hospital will be keeping an eye on it. Dáithi’s heartis okay at the minute and he is stable.“I know I speak for Seph and I when I say it was tough for us. When we first went over last year we have been educating ourselves ever since around organ donation and it’s got a lot more real. We were speaking to the surgeon who is going to be taking Dáithi’s heart out and eventually putting in a new one hopefully, it’s a lot more real,” he saidSince the family’s ‘Is Deontóír Mé Yes I Donate’ campaign began back in July, launched by Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey, there has been an increase of four per cent in the number ofpeople in the north who have opted into the organ donation register.Máirtín stressed how transplant is not a cure, but a last resort when all other options have been exhausted.“Seph and I came back from Newcastle saying we had to up the campaign, we have to keep raising awareness. When we were over we had to sign consent forms for the heart surgery for when Dáithí receives his gt, for the surgery to go ahead. You are basically siging a consent form with a list of risks and the first thing that it states is ‘death’ in capital letters and that’s jumping out of the page.“I did a radio interview this week and we were asked ‘so you are basically waiting for someone to die’ so that Dáithí can receive his gt – I said my son is dying, that’s the reality of it. We are desperate to help save his le and truly believe that awareness is key.”“Dáithí had his tube out for three months there and people thought he was fixed because he looks so well, people don’t always think he is sick.”An avid Paw Patrol and Liverpool FC fan, Máirtín and Seph spoke of how their son will continue to wait on the routine list. “He is stable enough to be at home,” explained Seph. “We asked the medical team over in Newcastle what are his chances of getting a heart on the routine list and there was little to none. It’s not impossible but it doesn’t happen that often. There are quite a few children around Dáithí’s weight and age that are unfortunately on the urgent list. We want to be at this stage because it means we are getting more time.”“You don’t want him to get worse but he is going to get worse,” added Máirtín. “While organ donation as a whole is up, hearts for children are down the last two years and that list is going up. As I said transplant is not a cure, transplant give you time. Everybody is dferent the first transplant baby in the UK is now in her ’s. The anxiety that Seph and I have will probably never go away. The last two years have been some of the best and worst times of our lives. We love Dáithí so much and will do anything to get as much time with him as possible.“We have put down hurdles, the first was getting to Newcastle, the second was getting Dáithí assessed, the third was getting him accepted onto the organ list and the next one is getting him a new heart. There will be lots after that but we’ve been taken it one wee step at a time. We would rather be on that rocky road than no road at all,” he said.A family health morning will take place on Saturday February  from -pm as part of Heart Awarnesss month at Glór na Móna.To register to become an organ donor visit: www.organdonation.nhs.uk register-to-donate register-your-details "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"catherine mcevoy to be named musician of the year","story":"FOR anyone who is familiar with Catherine McEvoy’s music it will come as no surprise to learn that she is to receive the Musician of the Year accolade at the upcoming TG Gradam Ceoil  in Belfast’s Waterfront Hall. As one of the leading concert flautists in Irish traditional music, recording success, TV and radio appearances and a considerable teaching contribution has marked her distinguished career. While Catherine is no stranger to critical acclaim, she says that she was “completely shocked” by the announcement of the award, which comes at a time in her le when she least expected it.Over the last  years Catherine has balanced her own music career alongside a teaching career at St Joseph’s School for Children with Visual Impairment and ChildVision in Dublin. By providing lessons and music therapies to students with multiple disabilities and visual impairment, she gives children a  for their talents and helps equip them with skills to improve their quality of le. The positive impact of Catherine’s work is undeniable but, admittedly, it allows her little time for her own music. Despite being a professional Catherine says she deals with her hectic schedule by treating her own music as a hobby.“I wouldn’t have loads of time for my own music, but I was never a full-time musician,” she explains.“Music was always a hobby for me. I would do some teaching at home, and I would do the Willie Clancy Summer School, and I would do some stuff in the States too. The funny thing about the trips away is that they’re almost like a holiday. “When you’re a professional musician you are under a certain amount of pressure all the time, but I’m lucky in the sense that I’m not because I still play my music in the way I want to play it – it’s something that I’ve always done and I love doing it. It’s still a hobby for me even though it takes up most of my le. I’d love to do a lot more playing for myself than I am, but sometimes work can get in the way.”In her family le, Catherine is also surrounded by music. Her husband Tom also plays the flute, while her three grown-up children, Jane, Ruairi and Fergus are accomplished musicians in their own right, but surprisingly, having grown up in Birmingham, Catherine says she herself hadn’t heard Irish traditional music until she was -years-old. However, it was in those musically formative years in the city that followed that she picked up the distinctive traditional music style of her parents’ native Roscommon, which she would become renowned for in the years to come.“My dad was more into football and my mum was a good ballad singer, she would’ve sang at parties and that,” she says.“I remember listening to Elvis and Clf Richards – we had those sort of records in the house when we were very very young, but not particularly traditional music. “It was only later when I was around eleven that I heard traditional music. I thought ‘oh, I like it’. Then my brother was away in boarding school learning classical fiddle and then he got into The Dubliners and started buying their records. That’s when the whole thing took off. “There was a prolic music scene in Birmingham, as there was in London, but it doesn’t get such a high profile. A lot of the big musicians gravitated towards London, but there was still a lot of great musicians in Birmingham, many of them from Roscommon, and there was lot of great musicians passing through. “Funnily enough I heard an interview with Finbar Furey recently where he was talking about playing in folk club in Birmingham run by a man called Mick Hipkiss – the Skillet Pop Club, and we actually used to play there. I remember seeing Finbar play there, and Christy Moore. I also remember the night when Mick Hipkiss announced this new group that had just been formed and were getting on the road called Planxty – that was back in the early s.”She continued: “A lot of County Roscommon players would travel to Birmingham. One of the first lady flute players I saw play was a woman called Peggy McGrath from County Roscommon and I was really taken with her style – that really spurred me on as well.“The Roscommon style, or the Sligo-Roscommon style, is a rhythmical, flowing sort of style as opposed to what they would call the Northern style,” she explains.“It’s slightly smoother and quite up-tempo. It’s something that I inherited. I wasn’t that I consciously decided to play in that style, it’s just because that was the flute playing that I heard. I’m self-taught and what you hear is what you learn.”Although Catherine says she inherited the Sligo-Roscommon style, she has made it her own indelible skill and fluency. Her recognition as the TG Gradam Ceoil  Musician of the Year undoubtedly encompasses a le-time of achievement, but having picked up a serious injury in her hand just over two years ago, she says it comes following a particularly low part of her career. While her musical ability has suffered as result of her injury, in some ways, the award could not have come at a better time.“Two years ago I had aspontaneous rupture in my right hand in part of my tendon, so I’m very lucky that I can still play,” Catherine says.“It took a lot to get over that I initially thought I wouldn’t be able to play again. I’ve actually had to change my hold on the flute slightly. Obviously the older you get the harder it is to recover, but it has taken a lot of mental anguish to get back to level of playing that I would be happy with. I’m probably only back to about  per cent – I’ll never be  per cent, which is sad in away because I had this idea of retiring and going off into the sunset playing for the rest of my le. I had just gotten over it, and then they go and give me a Gradam Ceoil.”She continued: “It was the biggest shock I ever got in my le. It was massive boost, especially coming from a very low part of my le two or three years ago and sort of clawing my way back. “There are probably loads of other people out there who deserve it, but it’s a great thing and I’m really honoured. I’m delighted and to get an award for something that you’ve been doing for most of your le, something that you get pleasure out of doing, is a great bonus.”She adds: “It’ll be wonderful. It does come with a certain amount of pressure because it’s live TV. I’m the type of person who doesn’t really know how to handle the limelight, but I suppose a lot of Irish people are like that. But it is great, and I’ve had so much good will, which sometimes you don’t realise because you live in a bubble where you think people aren’t thinking about you and then you are showered with all of this good will. That’s nice, and the traditional music community are great.” Gradam recipients, who represent the crème de la crème of traditional music and song, will be joined in live performances on stage by their own special musical guests, including Irish fiddler Paddy Glackin, Michael McCague and multi-instrumentalist Sinéad Egan, to name but a few. A range of VIP guest presenters will also take to the stage last year, actor Stephen Rea and President Michael D. Higgins were amongst the VIP guests at the event.Tickets for the February th TG Gradam Ceoil Awards , priced from £., are available from www.waterfront or +  ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bmg-advert-banner-classified-v01.png","title":"ulster u21 club football tournament","story":"Carryduff -St Brigid#s -From David Mohan in CregganDANIEL Guinness was the toast of Carryduff on Sunday as his late point sent his side through to the final of the Ulster U Club Football Tournament at Creggan at the expense of South Belfast neighbours St Brigid#s.This unique local derby between the champions of Antrim and Down lived up to the pre-match hype as the teams served up a thrilling game with some fine scores and plenty of drama with the result in doubt right up until the last kick of the ball when Rory Brolly#s late effort from distance sailed wide as he tried to find an equaliser for the Malone club.In the end, Carryduff probably just about deserved their win as they were a little better in front of the posts with Ronan Beatty notching six points and having a hand in others to take the man-of-the-match award, while Owen McCabe was also in top form for the Down side.St Brigid#s had big games from Patrick Finnegan and Peter Webb, but they just found their scores a little harder to come by, although they certainly couldn#t be faulted for effort as they stuck to the task and almost forced extra-time at the end.Carryduff were first on the board from a Rory Anderson free after three minutes, but St Brigid#s enjoyed a fine spell with Webb kicking a magnicent score in response off his left boot, while Peter Henvey, Rory Brolly and James Smith added points in quick succession to move the Antrim champions three clear after just eight minutes.They would have to wait another  minutes to add to their tally as Carryduff settled into the game and they were on terms soon after when Josh Connery sold a couple of dummies to make a little space and he drilled a fantastic low shot into the net.John McGough followed with a pointed  and Carryduff almost had a second goal straight away, but Pearse Laverty#s shot flashed across the face of goal and wide.Ronan Beatty opened his account from a free on  minutes to make it - to -, while St Brigid#s ended a barren spell with Webb kicking another beauty.The teams went score-for-score for the remainder of the half with Beatty and Connery to the fore for Carryduff, while Webb and Smith raised flags for St Brigid#s as the Down side went in at the break leading - to -.A Laverty free two minutes after the restart extended the gap to three for Carryduff two minutes after the break, but St Brigid#s were level on  minutes when Patrick Finnegan was trailed back inside the area as he was about to pull the trigger and a penalty was awarded. Up stepped Peter Henvey and his shot was well-struck high into the net to tie the game at -.Carryduff made the perfect response as from the restart, they moved straight upfield with Beatty getting on the ball, finding Ciaran Sherry who broke through and squared for Darragh Connolly who rose to palm into the net and restore his side#s three-point lead.Beatty and Owen McCabe added points as it appeared Carryduff were set to pull away, but St Brigid#s refused to break as John Blaney and Rory Brolly kicked scores to get them back to within three.Beatty and Finnegan traded points while Beatty added another from play to make it a four-point game with seven to play, but St Brigid#s were far from done.Five minutes from time, substitute Paul Bradley gathered Peter King#s long ball and waited for movement inside. He spotted James Smith in space and played a high ball that Smith rose to meet and brilliantly palm to the corner of the net.Again, Carryduff went upfield and found the net when Beatty put Connolly in on the right, but while his shot was destined for the net, substitute Eoin Rooney decided to make sure of it by getting his foot to it. However, Rooney was well inside the small square before the ball and the effort was correctly ruled out for a square ball.St Brigid#s took full advantage as they swept upfield and Smith thumped over a great point to level with three to play.Once more, Carryduff were able to respond. This time, Guinness created space  meters out and his shot curled just inside the post with the referee # standing right behind the shot # overruling the umpire who waved it wide.St Brigid#s still had time to save themselves, but they couldn#t engineer a score as Carryduff broke away and almost sealed their win, but Rooney#s shot crashed off the crossbar to give the Antrim champions one last chance.

It does not take the option of a public vote off the table. pic TbkvqcZ— Keir StarmerFebruary , Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer insisted the move by Mr Corbyn did not take the option of a so-called People’s Vote off the table.Downing Street, however, said ministers were looking at the proposals “with interest” – although there were still “very considerable points of dference” between them.In his letter to Mrs May, the Labour leader set out five demands:–  A permanent customs union to deliver frictionless trade and help avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland– Close alignment with the single market, including shared institutions and obligations– Alignment on rights and protections so that UK standards keep pace with those across Europe as a minimum– Participation in EU agencies and funding programmes,–  Unambiguous agreements on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European Arrest Warrant and vital shared databases.On a visit to Worcester, Mr Corbyn told reporters: “Half of our trade is with Europe. A lot of our manufacturing industries are very frightened, very worried at the moment that on March  there’ll be a clf edge.“There cannot be a clf edge. We will do everything we can in Parliament to prevent this clf edge exit.”But Mr Smith, who stood against Mr Corbyn in , said he was considering his future in the party.“I think it’s something that I and lots of other people are considering now”Labour MP @OwenSmith_MP tells @EmmaBarnett he’s considering whether to quit the Labour party over their #Brexit stance.#EmmaBarnettShow pic FaWpBvnh— BBC Radio  LiveFebruary , “I think it’s something that I and lots of other people are considering right now,” he told BBC Radio  Live.“At the moment I may be asked by the Labour Party to row in behind a policy decision that they know, and the Government knows, is going to make the people I represent poorer and – more fundamentally actually – is at odds with the internationalist, social democratic values I believe in.”I hate to think what all those young voters who flocked to the party for the first time in  will make of this. Vote Labour, get a Tory Brexit.

They will feel they have been sold down the river.”Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner defended the sht in policy away from the six tests Labour originally set for a Brexit deal, saying the offer was made “in a spirit of co-operation and compromise”.“It’s not about tests now,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme. “What we are doing is saying we believe that these are the options that are available that would actually secure a majority in the House of Commons.”Sir Keir said the letter “sets out in robust terms that the Prime Minister must abandon her Brexit red lines”.“It does not take the option of a public vote off the table.”Matthew Pennycook, a member of Sir Keir’s frontbench shadow Brexit team, saidMrs May did not accept Labour’s terms “we must move to support a public vote”.There were “no other credible options left” to prevent a no-deal Brexit.We’ve now set out in detail the changes needed to secure @UKLabour support for a deal.

Her position on the customs union hasn’t changed.”Mrs May’s effective deputy prime minister, David Lidington, said the Labour plan for a customs union with a say in EU trade deals was “wishful thinking”.In Brussels, a European Commission spokesman declined to discuss Mr Corbyn’s proposals, saying only: “Our interlocutor is Her Majesty’s Government and the Prime Minister.”On Wednesday European Commission president Donald Tusk highlighted Mr Corbyn’s “pro-Brexit stance” and said “there is no political force and no effective leadership for Remain”."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland should get to vote on brexit backstop every five years businessman brendan duddy jnr","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Prime Ministers official spokesman told reporters in Westminster: \"The conditions for a border poll are set out in the Belfast Agreement. It remains the Northern Ireland Secretarys view that the majority of the people of Northern Ireland continue to support the current political settlement and that the circumstances requiring a border poll are not satisfied.\"Ms McDonald said Theresa May did not commit to saying in what circumstances an Irish unity poll might be called. The  Belfast Agreement states that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland may call such a referendumat any time it appears likely that the majority of voters in Northern Ireland would wish to leave the United Kingdom and enter into a united Ireland. The exchange between the Prime Minister and Sinn Fein leader came during a series of meetings with political parties at Stormont House in Belfast. Ms McDonald said that a majority here voted for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union, and that by the region being taken out of the EU with the rest of the UK, the principle of consent - a key principle of the Belfast Agreement - has been damaged. \"Nobody in Ireland has consented to Brexit, the people of the north of Ireland voted to remain,\" she said. \"The Good Friday Agreement, the central premise of it as regards to constitutional arrangements, is the concept of consent. We believe that in attempting to coerce the north of Ireland out of the European Union against the democratically expressed wishes of the people, that the concept of consent has been damaged. \"We also know from polling data north and south that public sentiment is of a view that in the event of a crash Brexit, that peoples preference would be for Irish unity. \"The only way that anyone can act in a democratic fashion is to respect consent, to respect the democratic wishes of the people of the north of Ireland and to use the Good Friday Agreement, its provisions, to guide us in the time ahead. \"Sothere is a Tory crash, and Mrs May has conceded as much on the floor of the House of Commons, in that event, not alone will there be pressure for a referendum on Irish unity, there will be absolute democratic imperative to call such a referendum.\"When pressed over how Mrs May had responded to this during their meeting, Ms McDonald said that neither the Prime Minister or Secretary of State Karen Bradley committed to saying when oran Irish unity poll would be called. She said: \"But that is the secondary consideration, the primary issue here is the concept of consent which is hardwired into the Good Friday Agreement, the fact that the people of the north of Ireland have not consented to Brexit, the fact that business, farmers, academia, community sector, trade unions and political system almost unanimously regard Brexit as damaging and negative, almost unanimously regard the backstop as the absolutely bare minimum and the bottom line. \"The exception to that consensus is the DUP. The DUP cannot rule the roost on these matters, actually the people need to be in the driving seat, just as they voted against Brexit. In the event of a crash, I think the democratically correct thing to do, the compliant thing to do as regards the Good Friday Agreement, is toto the people again, and in a structured way, to allow for the debate for the conversation for the transition and to put the question on Irish unity. \"Mrs May is a unionist, she takes a dferent view.\""},{"url":null,"title":"unionists vote down bid to celebrate pride 2019 with town","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, unionist councillors voted down the motion, which would also have resulted in a council presence at the annual Belfast Pride Parade in August. Members of the DUP and Ulster Unionists rejected the plan and said they would not be taking lectures on equality from Sinn Fein. Last August, Sinn Fein spearheaded an attempt to fly rainbow flags on the councils premises to show support to LGBTQ+ citizens during Pride.Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon was set to make history by becoming the first council in Northern Ireland to fly the Pride flag above its three civic buildings.But the DUP invoked the call-in mechanism, which allows decisions to be reconsideredat least % of councillors request it.The DUP said strict procedures on flying flags and emblems hadnt been followed properly.The council then sought legal advice, which both the DUP and Sinn Fein claimed justied their stance. The row meant Pride Day last August passed without the flags in place. People taking part in the Belfast Pride parade set off from Custom House Square in central Belfast. Michael Cooper PA WireSinn Fein council group leader Darren McNally told the Ulster Gazette newspaper it was disappointing but not surprising that both unionist parties had voted against lighting up the civic buildings. He said: \"We have a erse community and the onus is on us to ensure we not only represent minority groups such as our LGBT community but that we make them feel valued, included, welcome and safe. \"Lighting up the civic buildings on Pride Day and an official presence at the parade is a forward-moving gesture - small but signicant - which would send out a clear message that ABC council are here for our LGBT community at a time when they are subject to hate attacks and left feeling isolated. \"In amending our original motion of the flying of the Pride flag, we were recognising that some parties are on a journey with regards to this particular issue. Other unionist councillors have supported similar motions in other councils.\"However, UUP councillor Jim Speers hit out at what he called the \"mischievous\" motion. He said: \"Sinn Feins actions go counter to the good working relationships we need at ABC Council. \"They are the last party that should be giving lectures on the need for equality. For a party which was linked to an organisation which terrorised this community for over  years to be talking about equality is disgusting.\"The DUPs Gareth Wilson accused Sinn Fein of \"blatant electioneering\". He added: \"Given the ious and well publicised anti-DUP messages associated with the event in question, our party grouping decided unanimously to decline support for this latest Sinn Fein motion.\" "},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37792645.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Jim_Wells.jpg","title":"dup meeting on partys brexit stance did not discuss impact on northern ireland says jim wells","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said the mechanics of how the UK departed - including for a solution to the Irish border - were not discussed. Nor was a presentation on the strengths or weaknesses of leaving or remaining done.\"There didnt need to be because there was such a huge body of experience of people around that table that knew exactly the problems the EU was causing to our economy,\" he said.\"Once we established the principle of leaving Europe the modalities would work out later... we were just concentrating on the getting out from under the yoke of the EU.\"\"Frankly we could see little positive in remaining.\"Mr Wells - who has been ostracised by the DUP having had the party whip removed for speaking out against its leadership also said that while there was currently \"uncertainty\" around the UKs departure he was confident in \"five or six years time we will look back and say we were right\".The DUP said the sanctions against Mr Wells remained in place and he was speaking in a personal view and not representing the party in any form.\"It is unclear what meeting Mr Wells is speaking about,\" a DUP spokeswoman added, \"The Party Officers and DUP Executive Members set the policy of the party.”Sinn Fein said it was more evidence of the DUP chasing a \"Brexit fantasy\".We made right decision and each day we get more confident.FacebookTwitterVeteran DUP man Wells made the revelations on the BBC Stephen Nolan show. He said he was at the DUP policy meeting - along with all the other MLAs and MPs - which took the decision to back leave for the  poll.He was asked what was discussed, as there was no debate on how leaving the EU would affect the border, businesses or farmers.The South Down MLA said the meeting concentrated on the principle of what side to take and there had been an \"entirely negative\" experience among the party - which has held seats in the European parliament for decades - saying many saw the EU as \"senseless bureaucracy, interference, meddling and control\".It was put to him that given the partys experience in the RHI scandal, would it not have been better to examine all the data and anaylsis in detail and it would have been healthier to consider the merits in remaining.He added: \"We didnt have the depth of knowledge on the RHI scheme that they had on the EU.\"Mr Wells said there  was not a single voice of dissent. He was askedformer Finance Minister Simon Hamilton had spoken up. Mr Hamilton has continually refused to answer how he voted in the referendum.Mr Wells said he had never seen the party as united on one issue as they are on Brexit and there was unanimity in backing leave. The former health minister also said he \"struggled\" to meet any unionists who advocated remain having knocked thousands of doors during the last election campaign. Although he did concede there would be a \"small number\" of DUP members on the remain side.\"Im talking about the unionist community. Areas like Kilkeel because of the fishing industry I was genuinely shocked by the force of resentment to the EU.\"He said many farmers were \"fed up\" with EU bureaucracy and the \"nay-sayers of the Farmers Union\" did not speak for those in South Down. He said the burden of rules and regulations from the EU was costing farmers a fortunate, citing the nitrates directive which, he explained, meant farmers had to invest in slurry tanks for winter time storage as opposed to spreading the material.He said it was a very expensive rule for farmers to adhere to but admitted he did not knowthe directive should be scrapped orit was beneficial to restrict the spread of nitrates in soil.Whats surprising you is that a party would have such an anonymous view on such an important subject.FacebookTwitterThe DUP politician of  years was asked thatduring the meeting any numbers were discussed or data shared on how a leave vote would impact the local economy.He said within the DUP the \"universal view\" based on decades of experience was leaving the EU would \"ultimately benefit all of the economy of the UK and Northern Ireland\".\"In the same way we have never had a statistical analysis of remaining as part of the Union, the DUP at its core we are a unionist party,\" he continued.\"Its not aswe were looking to join the EU, we had been in it in  years. We had direct statistical background information as to the impact it was currently having... and the decision was unanimous.\"And there has not been a raised eyebrow since despite all the facts and information we have been exposed to since .. we made the right decision.\"We feel vindicated and we see the attitude of the EU which has been so belligerent in negotiations we were right to try to get out of the institutions as quickly as possible.\"Apart from UKIP there is no more united party on this issue. And that has been the heart of the party since . nobody who voted for us in the last  years would be in any doubt that the DUP would vote enthusiastically for leaving the EU.\"No one has said we made the wrong decision. We are not having a guilt phase here, we are not worried or concerned. We made the right decision and each day we get more confident.\"In response the DUP said: \"In June , the Party informed all local media editors that the Party whip had been removed from Jim Wells. That remains the case. The operational note also stated: “Any comments made by Mr Wells during broadcast or print press interviews are his personal opinions and should not be quoted by your organisation as representing the views of the Party.”The statement added: \"It is unclear what meeting Mr Wells is speaking about.  The Party Officers and DUP Executive Members set the policy of the party.”"},{"url":null,"title":"spaceflight company shows off new rocket with 3d","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

projects that were agreed in its current four-year corporate plan which ends in , working to improve the local authorityrsquos recycling rates, both for blue and brown bin collections, reducing the amount of waste going to landfill by %.Mr Hannaway said the council was also delighted to open the new poundm Down Leisure Centre which he described as a ldquosignature project that will make a real contribution to improving citizensrsquo health and wellbeing.ldquoWe are even more ambitious for the coming year, with the agreement on funding for the Belfast Region City Deal, we have plans for a new conference and theatre facility in Newry City, the delivery of the Southern Relief Road and a -year programme of economic growth, the chief executive continued.ldquoThe reopening of the Warrenpoint Municipal Park in August and the opening of the Carlingford Lough Greenway from Newry to Victoria Lock in July demonstrate our councilrsquos commitment to improving our arearsquos attractions and environment.Mr Hannaway said that in the coming year Newry and its Cathedral Corridor would see pound, for improvements, festive lighting and events, to building on what has already been achieved in these locations.His focus also turned to Brexit, explaining that as the March  deadline for leaving edges ever closer, the councilrsquos relationships with government departments, the EU, cross border bodies and institutions across Ireland and Britain will become even more important as it seeks to improve the district.ldquoThese partnerships will remain a priority for the coming year as we deliver initiatives, programmes and services for all the people living, working and investing in our district, he continued.ldquoSome of the projects that will be progressed during the   year include further revitalisation of Warrenpoint, with pound, for town improvements, including shop fronts, new signage and a promotional and marketing campaign.ldquoThe council has also secured approval for the Ballynahinch bypass, a plan that will greatly improve access throughout the area and relieve the traffic congestion in the town centre.Mr Hannaway said plans for the southern relief road in Newry will be progressed after the preferred route was announced and was confident that developing a strategic link road between the A Dublin Road and the A Warrenpoint Road mdash a project that the council is working on with Stormont officials ndash will contribute to increasing the economy of the whole region.He said improving public services and the way they were implemented was another important goal for the council in the new financial year, revealing that five ambitious performance improvement objectives had been identied.They include encouraging healthy lestyles, improving economic growth and promoting the district as a premier tourist destination, delivering urban and rural regeneration initiatives, creating a cleaner, greener district, and encouraging and empowering local communities to work with the Council to deliver on its programmes.ldquoOver the coming months, the council will be working with local groups to ensure that their views on how best to implement these important goals, he confirmed.ldquoOver the coming year, the historic town of Downpatrick will benefit from a new public realm improvement scheme as part of the Masterplan which will be delivered in partnership with the Department for Communities and the Department for Infrastructure.Mr Hannaway said the district continued to benefit from EU funding, with pound.m being provided to South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which promotes economic growth and job creation in coastal and inland communities.Under the PEACE IV programme pound.m had been allocated to the council to deliver the Local Authority Action PlanmdashBeyond Tolerance in the three key areas of children and young people, shared spaces and services, and building positive relationships.Projects funded under

of the table to nine points when they condemned Killough to the also rans category at The Links, Strangford on Saturday.Killough, who have been forced go play their home games anywhere they can as the Mill Field undergoes further repairs, could easily have collected three points with a resolute second half display, but Ballynagross closed up shop after taking - lead at the end of the first half.Both sides settled quickly with the excellent playing surface encouraging players to keep the ball on the floor. It was Ballynagross, who didnrsquot seem to miss the suspended Matthew Rooney and Declan Dowie too much, that drew first blood in the fth minute.The dashing Eoin Rooney, who was making his first team debut following a recent move from Downpatrick FC, took full advantage of a failed offside call from Killough, sped past Stevie Laverty and beat new lsquokeeper Peter Kelly with a clinical finish.Killough retaliated immediately with Michael Burns, Gareth George and Tony McIhone prodding patiently from the middle of the park and when an opening came, Declan Looney, a team-mate of Eoin Rooney at Downpatrick not that long ago, put the burners on and rled a sweet equaliser past Conor McCullough, a former Killough lsquokeeper, from just inside the box.As expected from a derby clash, no quarter was asked or given and it took a few yellow cards to bring the combatants under control before Daniel Taggart popped up in the box to restore the visitorsrsquo lead with a poacherrsquos finish.Killough tried to get back on level terms with Freddie OrsquoConnor raiding down the flank and Ross Armstrong working overtime in a bid to create something of note. However, a Ballynagross back four of Conor Marron, John Shields, Aaron Beattie and Gary Carberry were in dominant form and they steadfastly refused to give way.Karl Gelstonrsquos side was more than happy to hit Killough on the break and midway through the first half, assassin Donal McCavera gave them a - lead as Killough were caught chasing the game.Killough had to throw caution to the wind and pulled a goal back just before the break when the dangerous McIlhoneexploded into le when he drilled in a beauty to give his side every chance of getting a result.The second half, although as equally as combative, never reached the dizzy heights of the first  minutes with two well-matched sides cancelling each other out in a midfield war of attrition.Chances were few and far between with the respective defences on top. Killough again did the chasing, but there was just no way past Carberry and Beattie and lsquokeeper McCullough did all that was asked of him.The longer the game went on, the deeper Ballynagross defended, but in the final analysis, Killough just didnrsquot have the necessary firepower to break them down.Killough: Peter Kelly, Colm Kearney, Stevie Laverty, Jason Clarke, Kevin Groves, Tony McIlhone, Michael Burns, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Declan Looney, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George.

It literally became a tidal wave of women going, lsquoYes Me Too, Yes Me Too, Yes Me Toorsquo.ldquoSexual assault is everywhere.It has been normalised. It has been accepted. Until we are shining a proper light on this, we need this to happen.ldquoIt has always been that way. Where did the phrase the casting coach come from  It is as old as the hills. It is accepted language. Because it is accepted language, do we have to accept that some women are going to have to be violated in order to get ahead in the industry ldquoI think its is abhorrent and I think that the way that women are portrayed on screen and how they are treated in the industry is rightly changing.However, McGrady, who is a former student of Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, defended the storyline behind The Fall which shows Jamie Dornan playing Phil Spector, a serial killer of young women.ldquoI thought it was an excellent examination at to what would compel a man to violence against women, she said.The youngest of five children, McGrady also talks about feeling ldquodeeply emotional about the Mourne Mountains.She also touches on her need as a young girl to leave Castlewellan once she had left school ldquofor some adventure anywhere and how she has experienced mental health problems in the past with feelings of anxiety and depression.McGrady, who is now married and living in London, also speaks of the ups and downs of her acting career and how after she performed Macbeth with Sir Patrick Stewart in the West End and on Broadway in New York, she ed to London to work in a club.bull Eamonn Mallie mdash Face to Facehellipwith Niamh McGrady airs on UTV on Tuesday at .pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Centenary celebrations for Hollymount Pipe Band anniversary  ","story":"THERErsquoS a saying around these parts by those who know mdash lsquotherersquos two things you canrsquot get away from, farming and pipe bandsrsquo.Born just after the ending of the Great War in  and reformed after World War Two in , Hollymount Pipe Band is marking its centenary this year.It was the first pipe band formed in the Lecale district and sadly, it is the only one remaining out of eight.While the faces have changed over the years, therersquos one thing that hasnrsquot and thatrsquos the deep-rooted family connections between its members over the decades.Despite the advert of streamed TV box-sets, the internet and smart phone that increasingly take up much of our spare time, family ties between the generations remain strong here.In , there were six father-son combinations playing in the band which practices at Hollymount Orange Hall on the Woodgrange Road just outside Downpatrick.Today, within its -strong ranks, aged from three years to , are four father-child relationships with lead drummer Ronnie Steele going for the record with three of his four young daughters in the band.Sammy Strain is the bandrsquos elder statesman. He has a proud direct lineage to the band when it first started out  years ago. His great-uncle, James Strain of Woodgrange, was the bandrsquos first pipe major.He also has pipes dating back to the early days of the band, a much-prized piece of heritage along with the framed photographs of former pipe band members and lodge members which line the walls of the Orange Hall.James Strain was taught by the bandrsquos first piping instructor, William Maxwell from Newcastle, who used to travel by train to Tullymurry on the Ballydugan Road and then arrive by bicycle or horse and cart to the hall.Sammy, who joined the band when he was seven, says, as do other members, that his introduction into the pipe band world was a natural extension of his family le.ldquoIt was actually my cousin who taught me the pipes even though my father Sam was pipe major at the time, he said.ldquoI joined in  and played my first Twelfth in Newcastle in  when I was nine. At that time I was playing whatrsquos called a three-quarter set of pipes.ldquoI canrsquot remember being askedI wanted to join but as my great-grandfather was one of the first members, it was just in the family. It was just handed down, it was taken for granted, more or less, that you were going to learn the pipes.ldquoWhen we started out, there really was nothing  so the band was number one. Itrsquos dficult now to keep a band going with so many other things for the young ones to be doing, so how we managed to keep a band going  years, I do not know.From head to toe, it can cost from between pound to pound, to kit out an adult pipe band member in full unorm and around pound for child members.The unorm has always represented a major investment mdash in addition to practice and competition timemdash for any member.In his history of the band on its th anniversary, Sammy recounted the lower end of a quotation given for a new unorm in  coming in at  pounds  shillings, which is equivalent to around pound today.The retired farmer has been with the band during the worst and the best of times.ldquoWe went through a lean period in the late Eighties and we werenrsquot contesting then. We started contesting in  and then again about five or six years ago, he said.ldquoThe best time of the band I can recall was in  when I retired as pipe major. My cousin, Francey Strain, took the band over and as we had a lot of young ones then, those were the best years up until  where we went to the World Pipe Band Championships in Cowal and we were upgraded three times in that time.The best of times for Hollymount was when they came runners-up in their grade B at the World Championships on their first entry into the competition.Ronnie Steele recalls: ldquoWe were very nearly not going but decided at the last minute so it was a real rush to try and book the boat and to find somewhere for us all to stay.Hollymount achieved their biggest achievement to date on one of the blackest days in Northern Ireland history mdash the day of the Omagh bombing on August ,.While the band continued throughout the  years of the Troubles, it emerged unscathed, according to Ronnie, who adds: ldquoThrough all the Troubles we had never any bother down here we never missed anything out.Another strong family connection belongs to pipe major Sam Gill ndash whose maternal uncle is Sammy Strain. His two sons, Jackand seven year-old Charlie, are in the band. When the  year-old isnrsquot at the band or at work as a mechanic, he continues to perfect his skill as a former world ploughing champion and the winner of the NI title for  years.ldquoMy father, Raymond, played in the band as did my twin brother, David, who now plays for Drumlough Pipe Band.ldquoWhen I joined at the age of eight, it was just a matter in those days that after my father came home from work and got a bit of dinner, he would have say, rsquoRight, I take you up to the bandrsquo.ldquoSammy Strain taught me the notes on a blackboard whereas now you have the likes of Ronniersquos daughter, Christie, who records me on her phone playing and she practice.Ronnie shares his love of the band with daughters Christie , Ashleyand three year-old Megan.

We have more quality control on our beef and that is what makes it high grade. This leaves us in a very dficult position because we cannot produce our beef for any less than we already do.ldquoOur fear is that, in the event of a lsquono dealrsquo and there isnrsquot enough UK beef to satisfy demand, they will look at bringing in beef from outside of the UK. If itrsquos brought in at a cheaper price it could very well leave us in a tight spot.Mr Rice, whose family has been in farming for generations, continued: ldquoBeef and lamb have been subsidised by the EU indirectly in the form of Single Farm Payments. Dairy, pork and chicken are already at world prices and can already compete. They will not see such a big fluctuation whereas we will be more exposed.ldquoIf Prime Minister Teresa May were to step in and take over the subsidies, the outlook looks favourable in the short term.ldquoBut when a boat load of beef comes in from Brazil then almost certainly subsidies will be reduced and wersquoll be paid to maintain the landscape. In other words wersquoll be reduced to gardeners.Describing Brexit as the ldquobiggest peacetime emergency in almost a century, Ballynahinch farmer Barry Higgins said the uncertainty of the situation did not do farmers any favours.ldquoWe feel itrsquos more of a back lash than a back stop, he remarked, adding that he hoped no farmers would be forced out of business.Dessie Canavan, from Kilcoo, said farmers were being ldquodragged into Brexit against their will.ldquoIt is unfair for us to compete against the likes of Brazil and Argentina, he remarked. ldquoDepending on the size of our farm, sometimes we are forced out into part-time jobs to subsidise our income. And thatrsquos before Brexit comes into force. There is much to be concerned about.A spokesman for Downpatrick Co Operative Marketing Ltd said its role was to respect the views of all its shareholders and customers, who are farmers.He added: ldquoOur business relies solely on the trading of livestock both locally and outside Northern Ireland and we are therefore concerned about the impact Brexit will have on our daily business and the local faming community we serve.ldquoAs part of a democratic society we respect the peoplersquos vote to leave the EU, but we are also aware the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain.ldquoWe now have a situation with two main options mdash either crash out or negotiate a deal to leave. Our main fear with the crash out option is that it exposes us all to a greater risk of casualties rather than survivors.ldquoOver the past  months Teresa May has been trying tirelessly to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU that represents and respects all the people within the UK.The spokesman said: ldquoAll we ask is the same respect is given to any deal which identies and supports the uniqueness of trading and faming in Northern Ireland. Businesses and farmers are very good at adapting to change in whatever form it comes but at present, with no clear decision on Brexit, the ongoing development of any business has been affected.The Ulster Farmersrsquo Union is also concerned at the prospect of a lsquono dealrsquo Brexit UFU president Ivor Ferguson added: ldquoWe respect the referendum result and that the UK will leave the EU. However, the uncertainty is very damaging.ldquoWith March  less than  days away decisions need to be taken urgently and a deal agreed. Leaving the EU without a deal would be catastrophic for Northern Irelandrsquos farming families and their businesses.ldquoNo deal means high tarfs on our exports creating an effective trade embargo and the possibility of lower standard imports flooding the UK market.ldquoThese practical issues will have an immediate and profound impact on farmers, causing major disruptions to the supply chain, crippling the industry and rendering our farmers uncompetitive..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 6%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch headmaster hit out at the education authorities this week for the lack of permanent accommodation at his school where two thirds of the pupils are in wooden huts.Mr Harry Bent said St Colmanrsquos High School had been promised a major extension, but was unlikely to get it ldquoas long as comprehensive education is the policy of the Government.Speaking at the schoolrsquos annual prize day, Mr Bent said it angered him that the provision of accommodation had not kept pace with the growing numbers and successes of pupils.ldquoIn St Colmanrsquos nine temporary classrooms accommodate  pupils out of a total of , he said. ldquoThis means that almost two thirds of our pupils are in temporary accommodation which was first erected as a temporary measure ten years ago.Mr Bent stressed temporary classrooms may solve a financial problem for the Government, but there was so substitute for normal school accommodation.ldquoAt least  of the  subjects on the secondary curriculum are practical subjects, such as domestic science.

The only exception would be when sensitive information is being discussed, he said. ldquoNo reasoning was given as to why the CIL visit should have been in private.Councillor Dermot Curran said the event should have been held in the ldquofull glare of the public and asked why more meetings were now being arranged mdash at the ratepayersrsquo expense mdash when one open to all councillors, the press and the public would have been sufficient.Slieve Croob councillor John Rice also expressed concern that only elected representatives were able to hear from the Commissioners.ldquoThis meeting was about a lighthouse and it was ridiculous that the public, in particular those campaigning to retain the beam, were not permitted to listen to the debate, he added.Cllr Cadogan Enright, whose proposal that reporters and the public should have been admitted was defeated, believes there was no reason to exclude them. He claimed the attitude of ldquohiding what was going on in council was becoming too common and needed to be stopped.ldquoTransparency in council is the best way to win public trust, he declared. ldquoThe Commissioners said they are not proposing to take away the existing apparatus except for the mercury bath. They propose putting a new rotating LED beam on the top of the lighthouse to demonstrate that they were listening to local people and plan to bring this all to consultation later in the year.Cllr Enright said the Commissioners confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Council could bring forward a partnership with a local preservation group in a manner similar to what happened at Loop Head lighthouse in Co Clare.A council spokesman said: ldquoThis workshop was a preliminary information session for councillors and prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation is planned, he said.The spokesman added: ldquoCouncillors present also agreed to invite officers from the Commissioner of Irish Lights to a joint DEA Forum meeting to ensure information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Magical Mooney conjures up late%2C late winner  ","story":"DOWN were forced to rely on an eleventh hour intervention from Caolan Mooney to get over the line at Connolly Park, Sligo, on Sunday.The Rostrevor governor swooped in added time to turn a - to - deficit into a winning scenario with a sensational last-gasp goal to give Paddy Tallyrsquos charges their first win of the campaign.It all looked so bleak for the visitors for most of the game as Sligo dominated the exchanges, but Down hung on grimly and Mooney saved the day four minutes into added time.Sligo started in a hurry and points from Pat Hughes and Liam Gaughan gave the hosts a - to - lead after five minutes.Hughes slammed in a quick goal to increase Sligorsquos lead to five points before Paul Devlin registered Downrsquos first score with a converted free in the eighth minute.Further unanswered points from Pat Havern and Ryan and Jerome Johnston brought Down to within a point of the home side midway through the first half.

It is also hoped to provide a storage and work area and space for the community to use.Cllr Curran said many people were eager to read the conclusions of the government departmentrsquos review, particularly in the context of a post-Brexit scenario.He added: ldquoAt this point in time all those within the fishing sector in particular are looking at the ongoing discussions around Brexit and wondering what any final decision will have on an already heavily regulated industry.Meanwhile, Ardglass Golf Club is the venue for a special event next Wednesday, February , when funding opportunities under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund support programme will be outlined during an information session which runs between am and .pm.The funding initiative is designed to support a broad range of projects that focus on promoting economic growth through job creation and social inclusion in coastal and inland communities which depend on fishing and aquaculture.This includes the ersication of activities within fisheries and into other sectors of the maritime economy with the pound.m funding cake being administered by the South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which comprises representatives from the public, private and voluntary sectors within the Newry, Mourne and Down and Ards and North Down council areas.The projects eligible for financial support must must demonstrate how they will impact on fishing dependent communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Spa’s James and Kirsty dance to success  ","story":"YOUNG farmers from all over Co Down descended upon a Belfast hotel recently for this yearrsquos star-studded grand final of Strictly Young Farmers.More usually associated with Simmentals and Shorthorns the Strictly contestants showed they were equally at home with a good salsa or a samba on stage at the Crown Plaza Hotel in a bid to win the much revered glitter ball.The event sponsored by Barclays, saw Young Farmersrsquo clubs from all over Co Down welcome a crowd of over , made up of sponsors, family and friends, to support this yearrsquos dancers.The enthusiastic audience were dazzled with a vast array of steps and styles including the cha cha cha, jive, charleston, paso doble and American smooth.In preparation for the big night the committed couples underwent a strict regime every Monday evening since last November.Following much swinging, sweat and a lot of fake tan the couples were well able to showcase their talent at the annual event to raise funds for Alzheimerrsquos Society and local Young Farmersrsquo clubs.The event was hosted by past YFCU president Roberta Simmons, of Rathfriland YFC, past YFCU vice-president Harry Crosby, of Spa YFC, and current YFCU vice-president Andrew Patton, from Newtownards YFC.Assisting with the eveningrsquos entertainment were judges Karen Patterson from the BBC and past Young Farmer, James Trotman, Agri Manager for Barclays, Janet Plunkett, Fundraising Manager for Alzheimerrsquos Society in Northern Ireland, and Zita McNaugher, current YFCU deputy president.Competing couples George Porter and Laura Sproule, Matthew Ney and Rebecca Nelson, Chris Reid and Sarah Robinson, Harry Walker and Emma Connolly, James Gilpin and Emma McAnea, Ward Patterson and Sarah Reid, Richard Kennedy and Jessica Lee, Harry Hamilton and Louise McAnea, Graham Annett and Sarah Graham wowed the crowd with their twinkle toes.However, it was James McCauley and Kirsty Burrows, from Spa YFC, who danced their way to the top with their energetic charleston to be crowned Strictly winners .The organising committee, led by Co Down YFC chairperson Linzi Stewart and secretary Kristina McKeag, thanked everyone who helped make the night such a success, particularly sponsors, hosts, judges, family and friends and last but not least the dancers, who were the stars of the show..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17404257.fantastic-night-at-our-celebration-of-sport/resources/images/9391172.jpg","title":"outstanding quality at second calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

But also we recognise that it has been politicised in many ways, and we think that discussion needs to be depoliticised for the benefit and the good of the whole of our land.“I think we need to be sensitive, particularlygetting an Irish language act was too costly and bureaucratic and we need to measure that against hospital beds and all those aspects. So from that point of view, I think we need a little bit of common sense in the discussion.”He went on to add: “I think we just need to be careful within the breadth of what that encompasses.“Certainly we’ve to value the Irish language in a way that those who do think it’s important [are able to] recognise that and can see that.“But I think there have to be constraints and there has to be a bit of common sense in just how much it actually costs, and that I suppose is the other angle other people come at it from.”Lord Trimble raises £k in two days in legal action over backstopBrexit: DUP will vote against any backstop, says Sammy Wilson Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

Brexiteers may claim that like other lsquoProject Fearrsquo predictions the anticipated damage to house prices has not been felt but I suspect they will be a bit more muted in a years time.If the Government negotiates a deal with the EU before March nothing will change until December , .The overriding answer seems to be that there is too much uncertainty at the moment soyou feel it is the right time to move, do it.Read more: Should I renew my EHIC card or will Brexit make it invalid But what about mortgages In  the Bank of Englandrsquos Monetary Policy committee increased rates to . per cent in August, so could Brexit impact on this David Hollingworth, mortgage expert at London  Country said: ldquoThe direction of travel for rates has been a gradual increase but like any forecast for , itrsquos impossible to avoid the question of Brexit and how that might influence rate movements.ldquoIf the exit is a disorderly one there could be further weakening in the pound, resulting in upward pressure on inflation.ldquoHigher inflation would typically be countered by higher interest rates but itrsquos also possible that the Bank will look through that and could even cut ratesit feels that the economy is in need of support, just as it did following the referendum in .ldquoThe mortgage market remains very competitive, so borrowers have the chance to take action and remove any guesswork by fixing their rate at a competitive level.The HomeOwners Alliance champions the interests of Britains homeowners and aspiring homeowners, providing unbiased and practical advice as well as services you can trust whether you are buying, selling or owning your home.

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Still no breakthrough in sight. Talks will continue. pic vnCVybcjmdash Donald TuskFebruary , Mrs May took Mr Tusk to task for his comment on Wednesday that a ldquospecial place in hell was reserved for those who promoted Brexit with no plan to deliver it.She told the council president his remark was ldquonot helpful and caused widespread dismay in the United Kingdom.The PMrsquos meetings with Mr Juncker, Mr Tusk, Mr Barnier and senior representatives of the European Parliament took place as Jeremy Corbyn offered Labourrsquos help to secure a Norway-style Brexit.In an initiative which sparked howls of outrage among Labour Remainers, Mr Corbyn wrote to Mrs May setting out five demands, including joining a customs union,that would need to be met for his party to back the Government.Meanwhile, Bank of England governor Mark Carney issued a stark warning of the mounting risk of a recession in the event of the ldquonegative shock of a no-deal Brexit.With  days to go to the scheduled date of Brexit, Mr Carney said uncertainty about the outcome of negotiations was ldquoweighing more heavily on business activity, as he slashed growth forecasts to their weakest for  years.In talks with the PM, Mr Juncker underlined that the Withdrawal Agreement thrashed out last November would not be redrawn, but held open the possibility of adding ldquomore ambitious wording to a document setting out plans for the future relationship.And European Parliamentpresident Antonio Tajani said: ldquoWe are open to being more ambitious on our future relations, including looking at the Irish situation againthe UKrsquos red lines change.The Parliamentrsquos Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt raised concerns among eurosceptics in the UK by saying that Mrs May had assured him that ldquothere will be a backstop in any final deal.Open discussion w  @theresa_may. Backstop non negotiable. Well never abandon Ireland. I welcome @jeremycorbyn letter making a cross-party approach for the first time possible. From the hell were in today, there is at last hope of a heavenly solution evenit wont be Paradise pic yEzINJQdbmdash Guy VerhofstadtFebruary , The controversial backstop, which offers an insurance policy to avoid a hard Irish border after Brexit, is the biggest obstacle to securing parliamentary backing for Mrs Mayrsquos deal. MPs last week backed an amendment calling for it to be ldquoreplaced with alternative arrangements.A joint statement issued after talks between Mrs May and Mr Juncker said:ldquoDespite the challenges, the two leaders agreed that their teams should hold talks as to whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK Parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European Council.Mrs May set out MPsrsquo demands for a ldquolegally binding change to the terms of the backstop, while Mr Juncker ldquounderlined that the EU will not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement.Theresa May is greeted by European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker as she arrives in Brussels for crunch Brexit talks ndash her first visit since her deal was defeated by the Commons pic jonVWuKJXmdash Harriet LineFebruary , But he ldquoexpressed his openness to add wording to the Political Declaration to be ldquomore ambitious in terms of content and speed when it comes to the future relationship.The PM later said:ldquoI have set out very clearly the position from Parliament that we must have legally binding changes to the Withdrawal Agreement in order to deal with Parliamentrsquos concerns over the backstop.ldquoWhat I see and hear from leaders is a desire for us to work together to ensure that we can deliver the UK leaving the European Union with a deal.ldquoMy work is to deliver Brexit, to deliver it on time and I am going to be negotiating hard in the coming days to do just that.Im clear that I am going to deliver Brexit, Im going to deliver it on time, thats what Im going to do for the British public ndash Ill be negotiating hard in the coming days to do just that. pic kaMJYtYQmdash Theresa MayFebruary , Mrs May was offered a chink of light by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who again ruled out reopening the Withdrawal Agreement, but said she believed ldquosolutions could be found.Speaking during a visit to Slovakia, Mrs Merkel said: ldquoI think we can find solutions without reopening the Withdrawal Agreement. That is not on the agenda for us.\"In diplomatic statements, the description ldquorobust often indicates a heated row.European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinassaid that the word was ldquosomething that both sides agreed was an accurate way to describe the tonality of the meeting.As Mrs May arrived in Brussels a protester waving a placard reading ldquoDonrsquot crash out leaped in front of the PMrsquos convoy as it arrived at the Commissionrsquos Berlaymont HQ but was quickly whisked away.The possibility of a ldquodisruptive Brexit is causing economic uncertainty in the EU, commission vice-president ValdisDombrovskis said, as Brussels revealed its latest economic forecast.The EU economy is expected to grow .% in , with the UKrsquos forecast at .% ndash although this is a ldquopurely technical assumption based on a status quo relationship with Brussels.Mr Dombrovskis said: ldquoThe possibility of a disruptive Brexit creates additional uncertainty.Meanwhile, the Dailyreported that Mrs May is seeking to delay another Commons ldquomeaningful vote on the Governmentrsquos Brexit stance until the end of February ndash just a month before the UK is scheduled to quit the EU on March ..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: May vows to deliver Brexit on time after agreeing to new round of talks article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Talks will continue. pic vnCVybcjmdash Donald TuskFebruary , Mrs May took Mr Tusk to task for his comment on Wednesday that a ldquospecial place in hell was reserved for those who promoted Brexit with no plan to deliver it.She told the council president his remark was ldquonot helpful and caused widespread dismay in the United Kingdom.The PMrsquos meetings with Mr Juncker, Mr Tusk, Mr Barnier and senior representatives of the European Parliament took place as Jeremy Corbyn offered Labourrsquos help to secure a Norway-style Brexit.In an initiative which sparked howls of outrage among Labour Remainers, Mr Corbyn wrote to Mrs May setting out five demands, including joining a customs union,that would need to be met for his party to back the Government.Meanwhile, Bank of England governor Mark Carney issued a stark warning of the mounting risk of a recession in the event of the ldquonegative shock of a no-deal Brexit.With  days to go to the scheduled date of Brexit, Mr Carney said uncertainty about the outcome of negotiations was ldquoweighing more heavily on business activity, as he slashed growth forecasts to their weakest for  years.In talks with the PM, Mr Juncker underlined that the Withdrawal Agreement thrashed out last November would not be redrawn, but held open the possibility of adding ldquomore ambitious wording to a document setting out plans for the future relationship.And European Parliamentpresident Antonio Tajani said: ldquoWe are open to being more ambitious on our future relations, including looking at the Irish situation againthe UKrsquos red lines change.The Parliamentrsquos Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt raised concerns among eurosceptics in the UK by saying that Mrs May had assured him that ldquothere will be a backstop in any final deal.Open discussion w  @theresa_may. Backstop non negotiable. Well never abandon Ireland. I welcome @jeremycorbyn letter making a cross-party approach for the first time possible. From the hell were in today, there is at last hope of a heavenly solution evenit wont be Paradise pic yEzINJQdbmdash Guy VerhofstadtFebruary , The controversial backstop, which offers an insurance policy to avoid a hard Irish border after Brexit, is the biggest obstacle to securing parliamentary backing for Mrs Mayrsquos deal. MPs last week backed an amendment calling for it to be ldquoreplaced with alternative arrangements.A joint statement issued after talks between Mrs May and Mr Juncker said:ldquoDespite the challenges, the two leaders agreed that their teams should hold talks as to whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK Parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European Council.Mrs May set out MPsrsquo demands for a ldquolegally binding change to the terms of the backstop, while Mr Juncker ldquounderlined that the EU will not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement.Theresa May is greeted by European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker as she arrives in Brussels for crunch Brexit talks ndash her first visit since her deal was defeated by the Commons pic jonVWuKJXmdash Harriet LineFebruary , But he ldquoexpressed his openness to add wording to the Political Declaration to be ldquomore ambitious in terms of content and speed when it comes to the future relationship.The PM later said:ldquoI have set out very clearly the position from Parliament that we must have legally binding changes to the Withdrawal Agreement in order to deal with Parliamentrsquos concerns over the backstop.ldquoWhat I see and hear from leaders is a desire for us to work together to ensure that we can deliver the UK leaving the European Union with a deal.ldquoMy work is to deliver Brexit, to deliver it on time and I am going to be negotiating hard in the coming days to do just that.Im clear that I am going to deliver Brexit, Im going to deliver it on time, thats what Im going to do for the British public ndash Ill be negotiating hard in the coming days to do just that. pic kaMJYtYQmdash Theresa MayFebruary , Mrs May was offered a chink of light by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who again ruled out reopening the Withdrawal Agreement, but said she believed ldquosolutions could be found.Speaking during a visit to Slovakia, Mrs Merkel said: ldquoI think we can find solutions without reopening the Withdrawal Agreement. That is not on the agenda for us.\"In diplomatic statements, the description ldquorobust often indicates a heated row.European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinassaid that the word was ldquosomething that both sides agreed was an accurate way to describe the tonality of the meeting.As Mrs May arrived in Brussels a protester waving a placard reading ldquoDonrsquot crash out leaped in front of the PMrsquos convoy as it arrived at the Commissionrsquos Berlaymont HQ but was quickly whisked away.The possibility of a ldquodisruptive Brexit is causing economic uncertainty in the EU, commission vice-president ValdisDombrovskis said, as Brussels revealed its latest economic forecast.The EU economy is expected to grow .% in , with the UKrsquos forecast at .% ndash although this is a ldquopurely technical assumption based on a status quo relationship with Brussels.Mr Dombrovskis said: ldquoThe possibility of a disruptive Brexit creates additional uncertainty.Meanwhile, the Dailyreported that Mrs May is seeking to delay another Commons ldquomeaningful vote on the Governmentrsquos Brexit stance until the end of February ndash just a month before the UK is scheduled to quit the EU on March ..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: May vows to deliver Brexit on time after agreeing to new round of talks article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

We are not where we need to be on self-harm and suicide, and we need to do more to protect the most vulnerable in our community.ldquoI have a responsibility to get this right. We will get better and we are committed to finding and removing this content at scale, and working with experts and the wider industry to find ways to support people when theyrsquore most in need.On Thursday afternoon the sitersquos boss met the Health Secretary along with representatives from Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Pinterest, TechUK, Samaritans, Internet Association UK, and Google, to discuss content on suicide and self-harm.Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock After the meeting, Mr Hancock said: ldquoThis is an important change, therersquos lots more things that we need to see, like transparency over how much damaging material there is and also I want to see when people search for material about suicide and self harm, that they are directed better to help, to the Samaritans, to the NSPCC.ldquoWersquove seen today progress, the discussions were productive, and the willingness to try and solve this problem.ldquoWersquove got to be led by what the clinicians, what the experts say needs to be taken down and whatrsquos the appropriate way to do that.ldquoWhat all the companies that I met today committed to was that they want to solve this problem, and they want to work with us about it.ldquoWersquore pushing for a duty of care to the users of social media particularly to children and that duty is something wersquore are looking to in a white paper that will be published by the government.ldquoWhat really matters is when children are on these sites they are safe, the progress we made today is good, but therersquos a lot more work to do.ldquoI care deeply about getting this right and I feel the concern that any parent feels in this day in age with children using social media and that children are safe.Molly Russell died in  aged .Her family found material relating to depression and suicide when they looked at her Instagram account after her death.Molly Russell, , who took her own le in November  Mr Hancock added: ldquoWhat happened to Molly Russell is every parentrsquos modern nightmare.ldquoI am glad Instagram have committed to me that they will now take down graphic self-harm and suicide content. Irsquoll keep working working to make the internet safe for all.ldquoThis is best delivered in partnership, because itrsquos the social media companies who understand their own s, we made some progress today in terms of taking down some of the most egregious, harmful material that promotes suicide and self harm.ldquoBut therersquos more to do in terms of being clear what materials up there and making sure that the behaviour of the site follows the best medical evidence.The NSPCC said the rule changes marked ldquoan important step, but that social networks were still not doing enough to tackle self-harm.Charity chief executive Peter Wanless said: ldquoIt should never have taken the death of Molly Russell for Instagram to act.ldquoOver the last decade social networks have proven over and over that they wonrsquot do enough to design essential protections into their services against online harms including grooming and abuse.ldquoWe cannot wait until the next tragedy strikes.Ian Russell, Mollyrsquos father, said: ldquoI welcome the commitment made today by Adam Mosseri to ban all graphic self-harm content from Instagram.ldquoI also welcome their plans to change their search mechanisms in relation to self-harm and suicide related content and to increase the help and support it provides to its users.ldquoIt is encouraging to see that decisive steps are now being taken to try to protect children from disturbing content on Instagram and I hope that the company acts swtly to implement these plans and make good on their commitments.ldquoIt is now time for other social media s to take action to recognise the responsibility they too have to their usersthe internet is to become a safe place for young and vulnerable people.ndash The Samaritans operate a round-the-clock freephone service  days a year for people who want to talk in confidence.

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"uncertainty interconnectors and the future of ni energy post brexit","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business With a potential ‘no deal’ around the corner on Brexit, what will that mean for the future of Northern Ireland’s energy policy – especially on renewables, the I-SEM all-island market and power generation  John Simpson takes a closer look On the last working day before Christmas , the System Operator for Northern Irelandpublished draft proposals of how the electricity systems and grids on this island may operate in -. Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
