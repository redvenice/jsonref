A total of 22 per cent were regular massgoers, while about 20 per cent had belief with practice and 46 per cent has belief with minimal practice. Some 13 per cent had no belief or practice.The research found that 72 per cent of parents had sent their child to their school of their choice, while 24 per cent their child to the only school available in the area. A total of 4 per cent said they did not get their first preference for the school of their choice.Mass-goersThose who sent their child to their school of choice were more likely to be mass-goers.For example, while 82 per cent of those who go to mass once a month secured their first-choice school, this fell to 59 per cent among parents who never to to mass.When it came to factors that influence school choice, factors such as location (83 per cent said it was important) , academic reputation (81 per cent) and discipline (75 per cent) are the most important.The next most important factor was being able to make the sacraments at school (57 per cent), following by being a co-education school (54 per cent) and extra-curricular sport (57 per cent). A smaller number proportion rated having a Catholic ethos as important (44 per cent) or having some element of religious practice (42 per cent).The poll also indicated there was majority support among parents (78 per cent) for the Catholic Church to have some role in continuing to shape and influence the ethos of schools. A total of 9 per cent of parents reported that the Church should have a “much more active role” and 33 per cent thought the Church should have “some role” in the ethos of their local school “equal to that of other community members, such as parents, principals and teachers”. The research was commissioned by the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association, the Catholic Education Partnership, and the Association of Management of Catholic Secondary Schools.The Government has pledged to improve parental choice by meeting a target of delivering 400 multi-denominational primary schools by 2030.However, new figures show there are 164 multi-denominational schools compared with 2,750 Catholic primary schools.The Irish Human Rights Commission’s (IHREC) has asked the United Nations to directly ask the State to account for its “slow progress on the estment of patronage from Catholic schools”.It said there is a need for equity of access, parental choice and human rights principles to be respected in education policy."},{"url":null,"title":"not for the first time i wonder if this is how he speaks to his parents","story":"The Secret Teacher: ‘As a teacher my word has never been gospel, but students came closer to hanging on every one three decades ago than they do today.’ Illustration: iStock“I wasn’t here,” Séamus barked back when I asked him for the homework due that day.Not for the first time I wondered if this is how he speaks to his parents. And if he expects to be able to speak to a future boss in this tone when asked for work due by a specific deadline.Even if we strive to empower today’s adolescents, even perhaps to treat them as equals, there is a hierarchical difference between a student and a teacher and it needs to be reflected in interactions between them.Artificial intelligence and technological advances threaten lots of aspects of the human labour force. Covid may have dramatically changed education and accelerated progress in many respects, but it has not given rise to anything which suggests that the human teacher is now an endangered species.What we facilitate has less and less to do with learning to learn or to work, and more and more to do with learning to live and interact with others.Human contact facilitates the growth and learning of young people in ways that simply cannot be replicated digitally or robotically. When young people use their devices to look something up, the very fact that this resource is so readily available conditions them away from memorising.The whole concept of the search button at one’s fingertips negates the need to remember. We teachers play an invaluable role as daily reminders of the need to maintain brain elasticity as well as digital agility.As a teacher my word has never been gospel, but students came a lot closer to hanging on every one three decades ago than they do today. From a knowledge perspective, students simply don’t need us as much as they used to. And so we human teachers must work at maintaining our indispensability. The less essential our store of knowledge becomes to the pupils, the more crucial it is to drive the human connection.Relationships with young people may have changed and evolved dramatically but everyone in Irish classrooms still remain fundamentally human.E-learning and self-directed learning are already fully viable options, but they are far from the norm in compulsory education. Schools remained closed for months during 2020 and learning content was both captured and delivered digitally in whole new ways. Youngsters are comfortable in the tech and digital worlds. Too comfortable, if the speed at which they reach for their phones is any indication.Where they are less comfortable is in the area of social behaviour. Some young people challenge me in ways that I know they see as empowered, the way Séamus did when I asked for his work. They forget (or perhaps they have never known!) that there is a level of politeness from which nobody gets an exemption.For me personally this is not about how young people “speak to adults”, even if for many grown-ups this is still very much a thing. If young people want and expect us to treat them as equals, this involves them ensuring that their brand of empowerment is more that of a fully fledged adult than of an embarrassing wannabe adult.Many of the most recent examples of this that I have encountered have been in the tone of voice used to address me. Defensive responses delivered in the absence of any trace of attack from me.Schools are making particular efforts to upload work now to accommodate those forcibly absent due to Covid. Given that we generally upload work for classes rather than iniduals there is a reasonable expectation on our part that absence from school (for any reason) does not amount to missing out on work or offer an opportunity to avoid submitting a task.Nonetheless, “I wasn’t here” remains the mantra, almost without exception delivered in a wary so “why are you even asking me” tone. Exchanges such as these are among the most exhausting things about teaching. What everyone outside the profession fails to realise is that Séamus is only one of the 250 students I teach each week. And that because I teach 11 different class groups across 32 periods weekly I cannot actually hope to remember off the top of my head who exactly was absent when. (And could the robot? I find myself wondering.)And so the real lesson on offer here for Séamus is how to conduct himself in such interactions. It is an invitation to look at the broader context and recognise that perhaps I’m asking in error and need to have that pointed out to me, politely. He may learn to avoid being defensive where there is no need to be, and in this case to recognise that the work has been made available and that my request for it is, in fact, perfectly reasonable.These lessons will serve him well when he has a paid role and a human boss – an inidual with reasonable expectations that their employees have the appropriate social and soft skills to function effectively in a human workplace community.We too easily reserve the opportunity to learn such things for CSPE, SPHE and, more recently, the overall umbrella of the Wellbeing hours in schools. To compartmentalise in that way is to dangerously underestimate our value as real-life, human teachers. We play a fundamental role in young people’s formative years at a time when the technological takeover advances rapidly. What we teachers do when we are at our best demonstrates the very limits of technology.And long may that last.Without us in their lives, what would Séamus and his mates be like when they join the workforce?"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Tom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside number 10 defectors club","story":"There are two words to describe what it feels like to cross the floor of the House of Commons according to defector Shaun Woodward: “Relief – and that it’s ghastly.”A little over two decades before Bury South MP Christian Wakeford jumped ship from the Conservative Party to Labour last week, Mr Woodward made the same journey, a process he found both more painful than he could have imagined and, in hindsight, always inevitable. Woodward quit after the Tory leadership under William (now Lord) Hague opposed plans to repeal Section 28, the rule prohibiting the “promotion” of homosexuality in public arenas including schools. Wakeford, a 37-year-old former insurance broker, who was elected as Conservative MP for Derby South in 2019, made his dramatic departure declaring Boris Johnson and his party incapable of providing leadership in the wake of the furore over parties at No 10.Whatever the motivation, nearly all those in the small defectors’ club of MPs say they have no regrets about breaking the ultimate political taboo.Westminster might love the drama of an MP crossing the floor, but what is the human impact on the “traitors” who abandon their tribe – and on the morale of those left behind? Can they ever find a home among politicians and activists who once saw them as the enemy, or are they always viewed with suspicion? Wakeford himself has said the decision to abandon Johnson’s party for that of Sir Keir Starmer was the most difficult of his life. Clearly shaken by the experience, he admitted to sleepless nights and stumbled over his new leader’s name in his first public event as a Labour MP, momentarily giving the impression he was now serving “Keir Llama”. For Woodward too, the decision was a traumatic one – “seismic,” he says - with his departure accelerated, as, allegedly, with Wakeford, by the Whips’ Office attempting to blackmail him into toeing the line.  “I just thought – this is horrible this is not why I came into politics. So I reached out to friends in the Labour Party and said: ‘I don’t think I am going to stay in the Conservative Party.’”“I am very conscious of the people I hurt. But I didn’t go because I would be well received, I went because I couldn’t possibly stay.”Baroness Nicholson, who as Emma Nicholson crossed the floor from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats in 1995, agrees: “I suddenly flipped,” she told Radio 4’s Today programme this week. “I was getting sick and tired of John Major’s vacillation on the European issue. I could suddenly take it no longer.“The worst thing about changing political parties is that you hurt people, and you hurt people who you love dearly, admire, respected, even fought with, but you hurt them very much indeed, and to live with that hurt is really, really difficult.”Like Woodward, who was dismayed by what he saw as the abandonment by Hague of One Nation Toryism, former Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Berger considers that her party left her, rather than the other way round. In 2019 she co-founded The Independent Group in response to what she viewed as a failure to act against anti-Semitism under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership this later became a new political party, Change UK, before Berger eventually joined the Liberal Democrats.“It was horrific to leave my political home of 20 years,” she reflects, “but in my mind it didn’t in any way represent the values that led me to it in the first place, so I could no longer be a part of it.“I absolutely made the right decision and I don’t have any regrets and I would do it again.” Jumping ship used to be a far more common affair – Winston Churchill decamped from the Conservatives to the Liberal Party in 1904, not returning to the fold for two decades. But even then “ratting” was a high stakes game. When a group of Labour MPs resigned the whip to join Oswald Mosley’s fascist New Party in 1931, two quit after a day to become independents.In recent years, defecting has proven something of a kamikaze mission of the 23 MPs who crossed the floor in the last 30 years, all but four lost their seats at the next election, Berger among them. Of the four who survived, two – including Woodward – had been offered safer seats than those they had won under a different party’s banner.The only two to have triumphed again at the ballot box are Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who quit the Conservatives for the UK Independent Party in 2014 crucially, both took the decision to resign as MPs and stand again in a by-election (Reckless, however, lost at the next general election).Carswell says the decision to fight a by-election was partly tactical, to put maximum pressure on then-prime minister David Cameron to hold a referendum on the question of Britain’s membership of the European Union, but also a matter of principle. Carswell’s defection was greeted relatively positively by both the voters and his party activists in his constituency of Clacton, with many in his local association following him to Ukip. To his surprise, most of his former Conservative colleagues in Parliament also remained on friendly terms.“I think they had respect for the fact that I had submitted myself to a by-election,” he says. “Had I not done that, they would have seen it as a case of getting elected under their colours then abandoning them.”That’s not to say that Carswell didn’t find the process emotional.“Anyone who is leaving one party for another is going to find difficulties. The only way to neutralise that is to resign and call a by-election.”Woodward, however, disagrees. “If you think that every time somebody crosses the floor there should be a by-election then Parliament should change the law. It shouldn’t be a reaction to one inidual’s actions. At the moment we still put the name of the candidate on the ballot paper – not the party.”Saying that, Woodward admits he felt far more comfortable in the Labour Party once he fought a general election in his new seat of St Helens. This, he says, helped him to get away from the disapproval of his former activists in his former constituency of true blue Whitney.Of Wakeford he says: “Actually, I think if he stood for a by-election, he’d probably win.” Additional reporting by Eleanor Steafel Rosa Prince is editor of The House magazineMore from NewsCommons whips don’t deserve their bad pressDentists handed pay rise to open early and work weekendsNortherners more likely to develop hearing lossGo easier on exam students because of omicron disruption, says teaching unionDon’t curse your double chin and pot belly – you may have ‘lucky genes’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"15m people wrongly told shield covid 19 expert suggests","story":"With Plan B coronavirus restrictions coming to an end on Wednesday, the clinically vulnerable may be understandably nervous about emerging back into society.Although the shielding programme officially ended on September 15 last year, many have continued to exercise caution, and government guidance still encourages mask wearing and social distancing at home, and among family and friends.But The  understands that four fifths of people did not need to shield in the first place, while many of whom were in the most danger were left exposed to the virus. Dr Tony Williams, an occupational physician from the consultancy Working Fit, developed the Covid-Age tool which estimates vulnerability to the virus based on inidual risk factors, and is now officially recommended by the Scottish government.He estimates that 1.5 million people were wrongly asked to shield under the original English guidelines, while about 1.5 million who should have been shielding were never warned. For example, the largest group on the shielding list were patients taking immunosuppressant medication, but their risk of death was just 20 per cent higher than for a healthy male - and far lower than many groups who were not asked to shield.Similarly, severely obese people have a higher risk than those with severe asthma, yet asthmatics were shielded while the obese weren’t. Diabetes has consistently been found to be a  major risk factor for Covid, and was mentioned in nearly one quarter of deaths between October and December last year.  Yet diabetics were only added to the shielding list last February, a year after the pandemic began, and only if they had other risk factors, such as being old, obese or belonging to an at-risk ethnic group. Dr Williams said: “We realised quite quickly that people on the shielding list were not dying, while others that weren’t on it were severely at risk.“One of the key errors was thinking immune-suppressed people were at risk. This is a virus that triggers a deadly cytokine storm, and we’ve now learned that giving people drugs to suppress the immune system has saved thousands of lives. So it’s illogical for these people to be shielding. “A million and a half people have been misled. Another million and a half who should have been shielding were never warned.“Now is an important time to get this message across, with people coming back to work. People who are not at risk need that reassurance.”Because age is the biggest risk factor for Covid, the Covid-Age tool works by crunching risk factors and then giving an equivalent age. For example, an obese 58-year-old with high blood pressure would have a Covid age risk of a 92 year old and should have been shielding, yet would have fallen through the cracks under the original guidelines. Conversely, a 30-year-old with rheumatoid arthritis would have a Covid age of 32, yet would have been asked to shield, and may still be concerned about returning to work. In February 2021, the Government introduced the QCovid tool in an attempt to learn from new data emerging about those at risk. The change added 1.7 million people to the shielding list, but the tool was largely used to prioritise immunisation, and failed to remove people who were at little extra risk. The  understands that when researchers ran the original shielding list through the QCovid algorithm, 80 per cent of people did not need to be on it.Mr Williams added: “Between 1.5 and 1.8 million were unnecessarily shielding, around the same number who should have shielded but were never warned. Many of this latter group will have died.  Politics has really messed this up.” As the government strives to get people back to work and boost the struggling economy, it is more crucial than ever to identify those who are no longer considered vulnerable, as well as finding those who might be unknowingly placing themselves in increased danger. To find out your Covid-Age visit - https:alama.org.ukcovid-19-medical-risk-assessmentMore from NewsCommons whips don’t deserve their bad pressDentists handed pay rise to open early and work weekendsNortherners more likely to develop hearing lossGo easier on exam students because of omicron disruption, says teaching unionDon’t curse your double chin and pot belly – you may have ‘lucky genes’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"banks preventing customers withdrawing less 300 branch counters","story":"Banks have been preventing customers from withdrawing less than £300 from inside branches and telling them to use cashpoints instead, it has emerged.A number of high street banks have increased the number of self-service branches, whilst Barclays says that it “encourage” its customers to use cash machines for smaller withdrawals and simple tasks.Whilst other banks said that they do not have minimum withdrawal amounts, HSBC now operates a third of all its branches as self-service only.

She told perpetually excited delegates: “I am determined that Scotland will have the ability to reconsider the question of independence and to do so before the UK leaves the EU – if that is necessary to protect our country\u0027s interests.“So, I can confirm today that the Independence Referendum Bill will be published for consultation next week.”This was followed by the sound of tumbleweed blowing eerily across the Scottish political landscape.Until March 2017, that is, when the Scottish Parliament voted for another referendum, giving Sturgeon and her ministers all the authority they said they required to seek the approval of the people for independence. Then there was silence for a while, and a few frustrated SNP activists started to wonder if the Scottish Government was being entirely straight with them. Then, just before the pandemic hit, in January 2020, Holyrood voted again for a referendum, days before Britain (including Scotland) left the European Union.And yesterday, Sturgeon took to the airwaves to dust off her old soundbites from 2016, 2017 and 2020, despite the fact that the UK government, whose approval is required for any such referendum to go ahead, has not budged a millimetre from its opposition to it.From her own narrow political perspective, Sturgeon is right to raise the prospect of another referendum. In fact, she has no choice but to do so. An SNP administration in Edinburgh that acquiesces to the democratically expressed will of the Scottish people, a government that followed through on its initial promise to respect the result of the 2014 referendum, is a government that would be fiercely opposed by the SNP itself. Nationalists did not sign up to membership of the party in order to fail miserably on school standards, or to build hospitals that pose a mortal threat to their patients, to lead a farcical procurement process to build new ferries or to fail to deliver on a promise to set up a publicly-owned energy company, at a cost of billions of pounds of lost revenue. I mean, that might have been part of it, but their primary goal has always been independence, nothing less.Sturgeon knows and accepts the political and constitutional reality that, faced with continued obstinacy in London, she cannot deliver on the one thing her activists truly want. No doubt she regrets this, but it is fascinating to note that whenever an SNP spokesperson is challenged on this fundamental point, they use a form of the same words each time: “It would be unacceptable if the Westminster government refused to concede to the democratic will of the Scottish people.”This is ironic, since the SNP’s insistence on a second referendum is fundamentally a denial of Scots’ right to have the 2014 referendum result respected. But as noted above, Sturgeon cannot do anything other than to pretend that a referendum is on its way. Were she to utter the truth, she would be guaranteed to lose control of her party and her activists, who do not share her legal or political analysis of the limits of Holyrood’s powers.So the question is not whether there will be another official referendum in the near future there won’t be. The more urgent question is: for how much longer will the SNP give Nicola Sturgeon the benefit of the doubt?She and her ministers have promised the end of the next year as the point by which another vote will have been held. When that date rolls around, Sturgeon will either have to come up with a persuasive explanation as to why people need to be just a little more patient, or she will have to be honest about the Scottish Government’s legal inability to legislate for a referendum.Given that her party actually supported the Scotland Act when it was making its way through parliament in 1998, it is hardly credible that they are unaware of the measures contained within it. Yet still they want to — in fact they need to — pretend otherwise.So here’s the bottom line: if it’s up to Holyrood and not Westminster to decide on another referendum, why didn’t it go ahead with one in 2016, 2017, 2018 or 2019? Most of us know the answer. Sturgeon knows the answer. When will she be straight with the Scottish public?More from NewsCommons whips don’t deserve their bad pressDentists handed pay rise to open early and work weekendsNortherners more likely to develop hearing lossGo easier on exam students because of omicron disruption, says teaching unionDon’t curse your double chin and pot belly – you may have ‘lucky genes’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"national insurance rise becoming increasingly indefensible","story":"Cabinet ministers have been out and about presenting a united front in defence of the planned rise in National Insurance contributions. Dominic Raab, the Deputy Prime Minister, said: “I would much rather we didn’t have to do it but given the pandemic and the walloping of the public finances, we do.” The Prime Minister had “grasped the nettle”.Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, had a similar message. The £12 billion in revenues were essential to fund the NHS and then an overhaul of social care. It was a “big decision” that the Prime Minister had got right, he said.Except that Boris Johnson does not appear to share the commitment of his Cabinet colleagues to this policy. Asked yesterday to guarantee that the tax rise would proceed, he declined to do so. It is emblematic of the incoherence at the top of the Government that senior ministers are being sent out to argue for a policy that seems to be in a state of flux. One reason why Mr Johnson is losing support among his colleagues is because so many have been dispatched by No 10 to defend an approach that has later been jettisoned, occasionally on the same day.If the tax rise is being reconsidered then that is welcome. The revenues are to be spent on an unreformed NHS and it is fanciful to believe they will seamlessly be switched to social care in three years’ time. Opposition to the increase is growing on the backbenches, though it should be noted that only five Tories voted against it when it was put to the Commons in September. More have joined their ranks, realising it will compound an expected cost of living shock in the spring. Mr Johnson is right to take notice.More from NewsCommons whips don’t deserve their bad pressDentists handed pay rise to open early and work weekendsNortherners more likely to develop hearing lossGo easier on exam students because of omicron disruption, says teaching unionDon’t curse your double chin and pot belly – you may have ‘lucky genes’Tired game shows are the weakest link and BBC ‘must axe them to survive’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rishi sunak must take responsibility","story":"Rishi Sunak must take responsibility for the fraud which has happened on his watchShadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden speaks after a Treasury minister dramatically quit Boris Johnsons governmentthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video lord-agnew-walks-out-lords-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:SXgYzz,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But the reasons he gave for his resignation matter to you and your family’s budget. Because it involves £. billion of taxpayers’ money, lost by the government to fraud. Frittered away – and now in the hands of criminals and gangs. Asked by Labour about the amount of money lost to fraud in the Government’s Covid schemes, Lord Agnew couldn’t justy that loss any longer. He no longer defended the lack of checks to prevent fraud to the public purse.  Of course there was pressure to get help to people and businesses quickly. But it shouldn’t be beyond the wit of government – the stewards of taxpayers’ hard earned cash – to get money where it needs to without losing billions to criminals. Instead Lord Agnew rounded on the Government’s handling of the affair describing it as “woefully inadequate” and “inexcusable” and characterised by a combination of “arrogance and indolence”. He blasted the loans given to companies with no record of trading and the duplicate loans given to companies. This matters because a government guarantee means taxpayers like you will be lumped with the costs.But it also matters because there is a growing cost of living crisis. One that is only going to get worse when the Conservativesapos tax hikes hit in April. We’ve been told these tax rises are needed to pay for health and social care. Yet the Government’s own Minister said yesterday that tackling this fraud was worth p off income taxthe Government could rouse itself to do it. Coming on top of billions spent on crony contracts, this enormous waste destroys any claim the Conservatives have to careful stewardship of the public finances. Value for money still matters. And it matters more when the Chancellor tells the public you have to pay more taxes to meet the bills. Bills that Labour has a plan to keep low, with our plan to save households £ as energy prices soar. Lord Agnew’s resignation is another reminder that the Chancellor must take responsibility for the level of waste and fraud which has happened on his watch. And he shouldn’t continue to hide while asking the British people to pay the price.

Sir Graham Brady, chair of the all-important  Committee made up of Tory backbenchers, has not yet received the magical  letters that would trigger a vote of no confidence. Political pundits believe many Tories are now awaiting the results of the Gray investigation before deciding whether or not to pull that trigger. Johnsonaposs alleged contempt for the rules put in place to help prevent the spread of coronavirus over the past two years has caused anger throughout the nation.In response to the frustration - which stems from millions of Brits making huge sacrices, including not being able to be with elderly loved ones - an investigation has been launched into the string of gatherings. At the helm of investigation sits Sue Gray, the most powerful person youaposve never heard of.Who is Sue Gray   Senior civil servant Sue Gray served as Director General of Propriety and Ethics in the Cabinet Office between  and .Before this, she worked in the departments of Transport, Health and Work and Pensions. After these roles, she took a career break in the late s to run a pub in Northern Ireland before joining the Cabinet Office in the s.She now holds the role of the Second Permanent Secretary to the Cabinet Office, a role charged with leading on the Union and the Constitution.When is the Sue Gray report into Downing Street party allegations due   The report is now expected to be finalised this week- the exact date remains to be confirmed. The is some chatter the reports could come as early as Tuesday, although later in the week is more likely. The report was originally due to be completed last week but was extended as fresh evidence emerged. PM Johnson confirmed the report is expected this week during his embattled PMQs on January . The reason no one has any hard and fast answers about the reportaposs release date stems from the additional revelations cropping up about more parties alleged to have taken place. What does the Sue Gray investigation cover   The primary purpose of Grayaposs report is, according to the Cabinet Office, to: Establish swtly a general understanding of the nature of the gatherings, including attendance, the setting and the purpose, with reference to adherence to the guidance in place at the time.The scope of the report initially set out to cover the Downing Street Christmas parties on November  and December , but the number of dates under the microscope has now been extended to include two parties that took place on the night before Prince Philipaposs funeral on April . According to the terms of reference set out for the investigation: Where there are credible allegations relating to other gatherings, these may be investigated.They also state that: If required, the investigations will establish whether inidual disciplinary action is warranted. The terms set out that investigators will have access to documents and will be able to speak to staff throughout its course. Grayaposs investigation will now include an interview with Johnsonaposs former aide Dominic Cummins over the claims he made that that the PM lied to Parliament.On Monday January  it emerged that Cummins refused to speak to Sue Gray in person for fear his former boss would try to discredit him, answering only in writing. Speaking to his Substack page subscribers, he said his old boss would invent nonsense and has instead given an account in writing, although he did claim there would be more damaging stories to come about Johnson. It has also emerged that, according to the , Downing Street police officers have provided testimonies to the report, with one source telling the paper they were extremely damning and are set to be an important part of Grayaposs report.Is the Sue Gray investigation independent  One key concern remains, however, about the independence of the investigation. This is because despite being at the heart of Grayaposs explorations, Boris Johnson is also the person who gets to decidethe next stage of the investigation can actually go ahead.He can also choose when to make the findings public. After Grayaposs report, Johnson will have the final say as to whether the Prime Minister’s advisor on ministerial interests, Lord Geidt, can actually start an investigation into any breaches of ministerial code. Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, said: “The PM has set the terms of Sue Gray’s probe and he has chosen to exclude the conduct of ministers from it, creating a neat loophole for himself.“Any judgement on the conduct of Boris Johnson goes to... Boris Johnson.  “A farcical circular process from a Prime Minister that will escape responsibility in any way he can. However, concerns have also been raised about whether the report will be published in full.Speaking on BBC Radio aposs Today Programme, the education secretary Nadhim Zahawi said: So the terms of reference for Sue Gray’s report is that the findings of her report will be made public, and the prime minister has pledged he will come to parliament to then make a statement and be scrutinised by colleagues on the findings of that report.” But when askedthis specically meant that only the findings of the report and not the whole thing would be published, he said: “The findings of Sue Gray’s report will be made public – that is the terms of reference. I think that will ensure public confidence. She can follow the evidence wherever it takes her, and she’s doing exactly that.” Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab was asked the same question by the BBC on January . He said: Quite the way, the process for it, will be for the prime minister to decide. But … there will be full transparency. He has said he will come back to the Commons and make a statement, so there will be full scrutiny.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonPoliticsDowning Street partyDowning Street Christmas Party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The terrible tales we tell today of people struggling to make ends meet are before April’s rocketing fuel bills start accelerate beyond recent rises, tightening the financial screw on people already struggling to stretch incomes to cover higher living costs. The year of the squeeze, , will force more folk to choose between eating and heating as poverty kills men and women in one of the earth’s richest countries. It doesn’t have to be this way. It’s a choice by the Conservative Government. And it’s a scandal that must be challenged, forcing the Tories into another U-turn – this time suspending VAT on energy bills, giving extra help to low earners and cancelling a hefty National Insurance tax rise.  Dignied, heroic Jack Mortimer and the others deserve our support. Out the bigots The sickening bigotry, prejudice and racism within the Conservative Party exposed by MP and sacked Minister Nusrat Ghani’s explosive claim her Muslim religion was why she was sacked from Boris Johnson’s Government is utterly repellent. Deep nauseating schisms exposed in the Tories by the unacceptable discrimination, Health and Education Secretaries Sajid Javid and Nadhim Zahawi speaking in support of Ghani while Downing Street and loyal backbencher Michael Fabricant add insults to injury, mustn’t be ignored.  This ugly scandal cannot be dealt with by the Conservative Party or Parliament. The Equality and Human Rights Commission must launch a formal inquiry into evidence that bigotry against Muslims is unlawfully polluting the governing party. Human writes Being able to read, write and count – what are confusingly known as the three Rs- are essential to live an enjoyable, interesting and rewarding le so the number of pupils going to secondary school struggling to understand even simple words and sentences is dispiriting. Improving the nation’s literacy so no child falls behind is a noble endeavour deserving more than lip service from politicians otherwise plunging disadvantaged families deeper into hardship.

Ex-health minister Steve Brine made £-an-hour giving aposstrategic adviceapos to drug firm Sigma without first checking with the Advisory Body on Business Appointments .And last February, Mr Brine arranged a meeting between Sigma and then-Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi. Two months later, the firm was awarded a £, government contract to supply Covid- tests to pharmacies.Mr Brine claimed to have consulted revolving door watchdog about all of his outside jobs.  But an investigation by the Sunday Mirror discovered he had not consulted them over a £, role giving strategic advice to Sigma pharmaceuticals until after he took the job - an apparent breach of the ministerial code. But both the firm and Mr Brine deny he acted as a lobbyist, and insist he played no role in the deal. But ACOBA chair Lord Pickles, said there was a reasonable concern that his contact with Mr Zahawi was only made available to Sigma as a direct result of Mr Brineaposs time as a minister at the Department for Health and Social Care  He added: I do not consider it was in-keeping with the letter or the spirit of the governmentaposs rules for former ministers for a former minister at DHSC to contact a minister with responsibilities for health on behalf of a pharmaceutical company which pays him.Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said: From the revolving door to crony contracts, the scandals just keep mounting for a Conservative Party mired in sleaze from the Prime Minister down. Even the governmentaposs in house committee is increasingly concerned about the behaviour of former Tory ministers and has called on them to act.Labour will ban ministers for at least five years after they leave office and create a genuinely independent watchdog to enforce the rules, ending the days that Tory politicians could profit from privileged access, information and taxpayersapos money. Enough is enough.In a letter to Cabinet Office minister Steve Brine about the case, Lord Pickles added: I am growing increasingly concerned that not all former Ministers of the Crown are sufficiently clear on the ious standards of behaviour, rules and legislation that are incumbent on them. He added: It is now a matter for you to decide what appropriate action to take. Acoba has no power to impose punishments on ministers or former ministers who break the rules. Former Ministers have to consult ACOBA before taking any job within two years of leaving government. The Sunday Mirror revealed last month that Mr Brine had only contacted the body after he had started working for Sigma. The Ministerial Code states: “Former Ministers must ensure that no new appointments are announced, or taken up, before the Committee has been able to provide its advice.” And ACOBA’s guidance for former ministers states: “A retrospective application is one where an appointment or employment has been taken up or announced before the Committee has provided its full and final advice. “This is a breach of the government’s Rules.” There’s no suggestion of any wrongdoing on the part of Sigma. Lord Pickles handed Mr Brineaposs case to the Cabinet Office to decide what -any - punishment he should receive. In a letter to Lord Pickles, Mr Brine said his failure to consult ACOBA before starting the job was an error and apologised for poor admin on my part. He admitted personally arranging for Mr Zahawi to attend the meeting with Sigma, but denied he was using his contacts to influence Government policy or secure business for the firm. Mr Brine quietly quit the job with Sigma in November, after the Prime Minister vowed to ban MPs from exploiting their positions with consultancy jobs. He has since resigned from two further consultancy jobs - each worth £, a year.

Plan B measures, meanwhile, expire on January , after Prime Minister Boris Johnsonaposs government already removed restrictions on the wearing of masks in the classroom and ended work-from-home guidance.The end of Plan B has no bearing on rules for self-isolating, though, which has also seen a big change in recent weeks.The period recently saw a cut in the hope that this would address a shortage in NHS staff and teachers.So what are the current rules regarding self-isolation  What are the current rules for self-isolating   People should already begin isolating once they feel they have one of the three following symptoms:a high temperature a new, continuous cough a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste People are recommended to isolatethey have other symptoms as the Omicron iant can appear in people in ious ways. The important thing is to take a test as soon as possible after possible symptoms appear.People are only free from isolation after five full days, so day six after testing, and can only leave quarantinethey test negative on a daily lateral flow test twice consecutively. If you live in the same household as someone with Covid-, you must self-isolate unless you meet one of the following criteria: You are fully vaccinatedYou are under the age of  You are taking part in an approved vaccine trial You are exempt for medical reasonsWhen do self-isolation rules change   The current self-isolation rules in England are now in place until March . The PM has indicated that the government does not expect self-isolation rules to continue past this point. If the data allows for it, the government will also look at scrapping the rules before the deadline.  In the House of Commons, Johnson said: The self-isolation regulations expire on March , at which point I very much expect not to renew them. Indeed were the data to allow, I would like to seek a vote in this House to bring that date forwards. In advance of that, we will set out our long-term strategy for living with Covid-. What to doyou test positive for Covid  According to the NHS, you only need to confirm a positive LFT with a PCR :youaposre applying for a Test and Trace Support Paymentyouaposre eligible for new Covid- treatments youaposre asked to do so as part of research you have a positive rapid lateral flow test on or before day  of arriving in England from outside the UK You can report your positive LFT on the government website, here. Once a person tests positive through a lateral flow test, they must begin isolating for five full days. If you are in the same household as someone, you can reduce the spread of the virus by keeping away from them, keeping shared spaces well-ventilated, surfaces clean and your hands regularly washed.

It has been awarded an official Certicate of Airworthiness by the Slovak Transport Authority in tests compatible with the European Aviation Safety Agency, meaning it can be flown in EU nations.And there are plans to make it a regular sight in the skies for London to Paris trips, allowing a pilot and passenger to roll off the runway and on to the road. Developed by Slovakian company Klein Vision, it took eight skilled specialists more than , hours to convert design drawings for AirCar into reality. The car-o-plane has completed  hours of flight tests with  takeoffs and landings to be cleared by authorities.  It will now go into production with a launch expected in a year’s time, although there is no price tag yet for the dual-mode vehicle. Sensational footage shows it soaring through the air and then landing and hitting the road looking like a souped-up sports car with a massive spoiler at the back.  The two seater AirCar has a single propellor, uses a BMW engine and can reach a height of ,ft and speeds of mph. Inventor and test pilot Professor Stefan Klein said: “AirCar certication opens the door for mass production of very efficient flying cars.  “It is official and the final confirmation of our ability to change mid-distance travel forever.” Project co-founder Anton Zajac added: “AirCar expands those frontiers, by taking us into the next dimension, where road meets sky. We do have plans to fly to London from Paris in the near future.”  The Slovak Transport Authority said the road-to-air vehicle had been rigorously tested with safety at the heart of the checks. Its director Rene Molnar said: “The transportation safety is our highest priority. “It defines a new category of a sports car and a reliable aircraft. Its certication was both a challenging and fascinating task.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON European UnionBMWCars\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I was part of the Re:Act Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. The NHS was under the cosh at the time and I was part of the RE:ACT Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. I helped build the Nightingale hospitals in Wales and also worked with the local council in Hereford to distribute PPE. Now I’m at the pop-up vaccination centre in Hereford. There are two of us here who are ex-military – the other guy is an ex-submariner so we’ve got a broad range of skills. There’s not a lot that comes across our path that bamboozles us.The first time I volunteered was on a day off from work. We were tasked with letting people know about the vaccination centre, but of course we didn’t want to browbeat them so we let people come to us. Initially people thought we were giving out lateral flow tests – we’d say, No, we’re here for boosters or your first or second vaccination. It was quiet for the first hour, but word obviously spread around Hereford and by the end of the day I’d say we’d vaccinated about  people, from schoolkids upwards. I think . per cent of people were happy to have a vaccination. I thought: Evenyou get five people vaccinated, that’s five people who won’t suffer.” Yes, you might catch it, but you’re much less likely to end up in hospital. When people ask meI think it works, I feel like I can provide the back story for them.We’ve now even had people come in for their first jabs. I asked one, What changed your mind  He said,Omicron, because it’s more infectious’. I just said, “Well done.”So while I don’t strong-arm people, I do tell them, “I think you should get vaccinated. ‘We all need the booster so that le can get back to normal’  I joined the Royal Air Force in  and my last posting was out in Cyprus, but I always wanted to transition to a career in the NHS. Back in October  I joined the East of England Covid- mass vaccination programme and my first role was to provide support in the planning and delivery of large-scale centres, hospital hubs and community pharmacies. Now I’m working as the children’s project manager, leading and coordinating plans. This involves collating, analysing and improving plans, reporting to the programme director and the national team, using my past experiences to collaborate, advise and implement processes.  I’m good at seeing a problem and thinking outside the box to solve it. I can get parachuted into a project within the Covid- programme and am able to run with it. Every day is dferent, but that doesn’t faze me. I’m very adaptable and flexible – and I’ll give  per cent to achieving the common goal. Working with other people from the Forces means there’s a great sense of camaraderie. We share the same service ethos. If there’s a deadline, we’ll just knuckle down and get the job done. This is not a - job. Even though I might have to get up at .am to jump on a work call, I have no problem with that. I was motivated to join the Covid- programme by my sense of duty, and I’m really proud to be part of it. I have a passion for helping people and making sure things are completed to the highest standard. This gives me a real sense of achievement. I like being able to make a dference. The public response to getting boosted has been great, but there is still a long way to go. I believe the Get Boosted Now campaign is so important because we need to protect ourselves, the vulnerable and the future generations. We also need to get everyone boosted so we can get le back to normal as soon as possible. ‘One of my ex-soldiers gave me the Covid- jab’  I was  when I joined the Navy as a medic. It was the year after the Falklands War and I thought I’d like to get involved in something for the service of the country – to do what’s necessary when the time comes. As a Navy medic I was trained to deal with trauma from the very basic things up to the most drastic ones you could think of, like gunshots and traumatic amputations. After  years, I left in  to join the Army, then in  I moved to the NHS. During the pandemic I was initially asked to oversee the distribution of PPE. There were shortages across the board, and having worked overseas with the Royal Marines, my logistics knowledge came to the fore. I could make sure community midwives and health visitors had what they needed. In some cases this entailed doing the deliveries myself in the van!  For me, the pleasure in the role was being able to provide medical staff with the assurance that they would have the equipment they needed. I felt I was making a real dference. When the time came to get my Covid- jab, it was one of my former soldiers who gave me it. That was very impressive because when I met him he was , wide-eyed and fresh out of the box. When I next met him he was teaching the volunteers and St John’s Ambulance staff how to administer the vaccine. I was full of admiration for him. He’d stepped up as a young man and was teaching much more mature iniduals. But I wasn’t surprised – that’s what we expected our troops to do: step into the breach, wherever the breach happens to be. You can’t praise the veterans highly enough for getting involved in the vaccine campaign. They will serve their community in whatever circumstances, whether it’s dficult or easy. You’ve got a group of people who drop everything as soon as they’re asked, regardless of what their family commitment might be, and go and do the job. I don’t think there is a better resource for the country to draw upon.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON British ArmyRoyal Air ForceNHSRoyal MarinesFalklands WarNigel JonesJake WadeHelen RobertsHospitalsSoldiersArmed forcesTeenagersThe FalklandsMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"covid rules masks passes planb","story":"Covid rules end this week – exact dates for masks, Covid Pass and what will changeThe government plans to lt a substantial portion of its Covid measures this week as the UK prepares for the virus to become endemic, meaning the virus may still be present but isnt a concern and isnt expected to be disruptivethis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video sajid-javid-says-uk-should-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:UbwnVx,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Others, however, will be less enthusiastic about the upcoming changes - with many of the countryaposs vulnerable still forced to shield from the virus. But what does the governmentaposs exit strategy from Plan B actually include, and when will the ious rule changes be coming into effect  Thursday, January   Two key changes are planned to come into place this Thursday. Face masks indoors People have had to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings - including public transport - since the introduction of Plan B in December, but as of Thursday this will no longer be a legal requirement. All kinds of indoor facilities have required the wearing of masks inside, from cinemas and theatres to indoor sports facilities and shops. The government does however still recommend people wear face coverings in crowded places, especially when filled with strangers. NHS Covid passes Indoor venues of more than  people like nightclubs and other late-night venues - as well as outdoor events for more than , people - have all needed an NHS Covid pass to be shown upon entry. The same has gone for any event with over , attendees.As of Thursday this is no longer going to be a legal requirement, although venues can use their own discretion and request entrants show a passthat is their preferred policy. The introduction of the law in the first place was controversial, with a -strong Tory revolt taking place at the time, leading to substantial pressure ever since for the Prime Minister to do away with the measure. Rules already changed Work from home guidance, which has dominated the working lives of many since well before Christmas, was lted last week. This was brought to an end when the official government advice for people living in England to work from home wherever possible was officially lted, with Johnson encouraging people to get in touch with their employers to discuss the next steps for ing to workplaces and offices. Ahead of the general end to mandatory mask-wearing, last Thursday also saw an end to school children needing to wear masks in classrooms with them having worn them since coming back to school after Christmas. Some rules remain The latest announcement last week saw no change to rules around travel to the UK, with people still needing to take a test within  hours of theirto the UK. There is also no change to the legal requirement to isolate for at least five daysyou test positive for the virus. The minimum time people needed to isolate has recently been shortened drastically, with people no longer needing to stay home for the full  daystheytwo negative lateral flow tests on two consecutive days after the fth day of isolation.

She now fears Jordan knows her phone number and address after using Currys like Tinder. Jessica, from Newsome, West Yorks., said:I thought he was helpful but after I got the message I thought it was a bit creepy he went out of his way to help me. He askedI live here on my own and I thought that was a weird thing to ask. I told him aposno, with my son, but heaposs at his dadapossapos. It was strange. I didnapost think too much of it but when I saw the text message, it creeped me out because heaposs been in my house and knows where I live. Heaposs now got my number and knows I live on my own as well. When I got the text, straight away I thought nobody  knew Iaposd had the fridge delivered so it had to be him sending the message. Itaposs worrying because thereaposs a possibility he could come back. But Jordan has since complained he was set up by Kacey and that the messages have destroyed his relationship.  Jordan said: Iaposve got a bird. My relationshipaposs been destroyed over this. Iaposve lost everything overnight. Iaposve been set up. Iaposve gone to this young girlaposs house in Bradford and obviously, sheaposs wanted it. Sheaposs been flaunting it. We put two items in her house and she askedwe were down for installation and I said no, then she askedI could come back after work and install it, but I said aposno, not reallyapos. I got in the van and I told my mate what she said, and he told me to message her this and that. So I started messaging her and we made up the name [Jordan]. She definitely wanted me to get in touch. She wanted it. She was begging for it. How did she expect me to come back after workI didnapost have the number to contact her  My girlfriendaposs seen it and obviously itaposs not good. I said it was a laugh with the lads in the van, but sheaposs not forgiven me yet. If she wasnapost flaunting it like that, I wouldnapost need to [text her].  Ryan, , made headlines last week after his texts posing as Kacey went viral. Jordan bragged about earning £, in the messages and claimed he could be Kaceyaposs apossugar daddyapos. Ryan then revealed himself and complained to Currys. Kacey, from Bradford, West Yorks., said: Ryanaposs dadaposs a plumber and heaposs renovated the house from as old as it can be to brand new, so I wouldnapost need him to do it. I canapost believe it. Heaposs disgusting, that guy. I canapost believe heaposs got the cheek to sit and say that. Maybe this is what heaposs said to his girlfriend to win her back. I feel sorry for her. I literally had a beige jumper on and leggings, so I couldnapost have been more dressedIaposd have tried. Heaposs obviously a creep. I couldnapost care less what he says. The fact heaposs gone into another girlaposs house and done the same thing, that just says it all. When asked about his texts to Jessica, Jordan said: I worked with someone dferent then. It was me messaging but it was a laugh. We were just messing about in the van as lads do. Nobodyaposs saying that itaposs alright. It is what it is. I wouldnapost do it again. I wasnapost trying to make them uncomfortable. Currys have confirmed Jordan was working for a delivery partner contracted to drop off their products and theyaposve sought to reassure customers drivers will face the sackthey breach their conduct rules. A Currys spokesperson said: We were very concerned to learn of the experiences of Ms Wheeler and Ms Hickling. Weaposre directly in contact with them and our immediate priority is to ensure their concerns are addressed. We recognise the privilege and responsibility that comes with delivering to our customersapos homes and we expect all delivery crews, including our delivery partners, to treat our customers with the utmost respect. We launched an immediate investigation into the matter and can confirm the inidual involved is no longer delivering for Currys or working for our delivery partner.

Ronnie Kermanaposs parents were warned they might lose their son after doctors confirmed he had suffered a stroke. Mum Louise immediately knew something was wrong when she found the tot unconscious in his crib in February . She would usually be greeted by the sight of Ronnie, who has a twin brother named Robert, standing at the edge of his bed waiting to be picked up.But this time, he was laying on his back with the left-side of his body aposall floppyapos, reports Hull Live.Louise and dad Phil rushed him to Hull Royal Infirmary and a CT scan revealed a black mark on the -month-old toddleraposs brain. The couple were then urged to take Ronnie to Leeds General Infirmary for treatment.  Ronnie was diagnosed with an Optic Pathway Glioman and Neurofibromatosis Type , which caused Ronnie to become completely blind. He has also since been diagnosed with Moyamoya disease which is caused by a blocked artery in the brain. The brave tot underwent several brain surgeries for the cancerous tumour inside his brain in  and . After a promising response at first, things took a sharp turn when Ronnie became allergic to his chemotherapy and his parents were told to prepare for end of le care. Phil said: When the doctors spoke about palliative care, I just couldnapost believe it. I was really shocked because Ronnie had been doing so well and we were told the tumour on his brain had shrunk. But the tumour had grown a little bit and they said there was nothing  they could do. I just said to the doctor aposyouaposve got to do something, youaposve got to help him and save his leapos. Doctors then put Ronnie on a daily chemotherapy treatment called Trametinib which he can take orally. He is the youngest patient to have been administered the treatment. Phil said the treatment has been absolutely fantastic and Ronnie is now approaching his sixth birthday. He added: I couldnapost ask for anything more really. He is just a little superstar, we never thought it would be this way. He can even aposbum shuffleapos from the living room to the kitchen. Even though he canapost see, he knows where he is and where he needs to be. Itaposs fantastic. Ronnie has also benefited greatly from sensory play using sensory boards and playing in the water. He has grown fond of swimming and attends weekly swimming lessons. Phil added: Heaposs a cheeky little boy now and he is quite independent. He knows what he wants and likes. He enjoys music, everything from nursery rhymes to rock music like AC DC. Despite his astronomical progress, medical complications are not uncommon and hospital visits are still a regular occurrence for Ronnie. The youngster will visit Hull Royal Infirmary next week to have his feeding tube replaced and treat his tooth decay, which is a side effect of his chemotherapy. To help him lead a better quality of le, David Freer decided to fundraise £ for any additional sensory equipment that Ronnie would need.David, who volunteers at Le for a Kid, will be doing the Jane Tomlinson Hull K run in June along with his dog Lewis, who is an NHS therapy dog, to raise the money for Ronnie.Phil said: I have known of David because he comes with Lewis at the Hull Royal Infirmary, so Ronnie has previously met David. Itaposs really amazing what people can do from the goodness of their heart. I canapost thank him enough.Contributions to Davidaposs fundraiser for Ronnie can be made on his JustGiving page.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CancerHealthMiracle babiesBabiesStroketumourTwins\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He lost his hearing after suffering an ear infection but has learned to respond to hand signals. Staffordshire bull terrier Rocco, seven, was initially handed into rescuers in  but was quickly rehomed with new owners. However when one of the owners died and the other became seriously unwell he ed to the Llys Nini Animal Centre in Penllergaer, near Swansea. Centre worker Sally Humphries said: His new owners were really lovely and Rocco took to them straight away.  I remember laughing at the fact he didnapost want to come and say goodbye to me when I dropped him off. He stayed by their side like heaposd known them all his le. When Rocco ed, staff learned that he was completely deaf, so they started teaching him sign language.  Sally said: He reads our hand signals and body language as a way of telling what weaposre asking for. For example, thumbs up means good boy. Most dogs are more in tune with our body language than our constant chitter chatter so itaposs not that tricky for a deaf dog to learn. Itaposs all about consistency and making sure you choose a simple sign for each behaviour that you are trying to teach, so itaposs as clear as possible for them to understand.Rocco is a wonderful example of just how resilient animals can be and proof that you can definitely teach an old dog new tricks.Staff hope the new skill will help Rocco find a forever home soon.

It was during the Nineties and he was a governor at a nearby school. We arranged to meet to discuss a story. My paper didn’t have picture bylines at the time but I knew who he was. We arranged to meet at a town hall but as I approached him a look of horror swept over his face. I stuck out a hand to introduce myself.“Hi, I’m Darren, good to meet you.” I said. “Oh,” he replied. “You don’t sound black on the phone ”The meeting didn’t last long.  I remembered it while listening to the preposterous Tory MP Michael Fabricant over the weekend. He was speaking after ex-minister Nusrat Ghani claimed she was told by party Whips that she was sacked in  because her ‘Muslimness’ made colleagues uncomfortable. Chief Whip Mark Spencer has rejected the claim as “completely ” and “defamatory”. Fabricant took to radio station LBC, saying: “I think the whole thing actually stinks. She’s hardly someone who is obviously a Muslim.”  Where to start  To dismiss blond wig-on-a-stick Fabricant as a ludicrous character Harry Enfield or Ricky Gervais would have been proud of actually allows the Lichfield MP off the hook. You can make up your own mind as to the legitimacy of Ms Ghani’s claim. It wouldn’t surprise anyone, however, that it has erupted within a party whose leader compared Muslim women to letterboxes and bank robbers. Or that Downing Street has confirmed Ms Ghani complained to Prime Minister Boris Johnson directly – two years ago.  Johnson, she claimed, urged the former junior minister to use the formal complaint process which, with this regime, is probably a bit like going to the policeyou have an issue with a colleague within the mafia. Don’t be fooled into thinking the inquiry called by Johnson on Monday morning is anything other than a welcome opportunity to keep the upcoming Partygate report from Sue Grayoff the front pages. If Johnson really does take the issue seriously, why didn’t he bang his fist on his desk and order the inquiry back then, when Ms Ghani told him  In any case the inquiry won’t be independent - even though civil servants are supposed to be. It will be conducted by the Cabinet Office – the people who work for the PM. Don’t be surprised when it turns up a nothing-to-see-here whitewash. The stag do that has been Johnson’s premiershiphas shown us a party stuck in the past. A nationalistic, flag-waving regime, replete with Benny Hill-type chancers pining for the days of the Empire and a time when you could say anything you wanted, regardless of any offence caused.

Last year the star, who plays Hugh MacClare in the period drama, filmed undercover in a farm where , chicks were being reared in a hangar. He said: “The moment the door was opened, the stench and the heat were overwhelming. The chicks were clearly in a state of terrible discomfort. “They had only been there two days and the floor was littered with dead bodies. “I felt so sorry for these little creatures. Everything about it was disgusting and I just felt that no cheap food was worth this.” Becoming a vegan in  Peter has thrown his weight behind the campaign, being led by pressure group Humane Being.  Their application for a judicial review of Defra’s support for factory farming is being heard in the High Court today. In court papers seen by the Mirror, Humane Being accuse Defra, headed by Environment Secretary George Eustice, of jeopardising public health by allowing “continued unsafe farming practices”. They cite scientists’ claims of links between pandemic diseases and factory farming. And they say Defra is flouting human rights laws by failing to protect the public against its dangers. Today’s hearing will decide whether Humane Being’s allegations can be heard in full before a High Court judge. Jane Tredgett, Humane Being founder, said: “Factory Farms pose a signicant risk for the outbreak of increasingly deadly zoonotic diseases like bird or swine flu, with the potential to kill millions of people around the world.” Peter added: “It’s not surprising that diseases are transmitted from these facilities. Animals are living in such close proximity that they become stressed, and their immune system collapses. “Corporations have decided factory farming is a great way of making money – at the expense of any compassion for the poor animal. “Profit is the motive, driven by the lie it’s producing good, cheap food for the masses. We have to actually own up to the fact that, here in the UK, we’re an animal-loving country in name only.  “So few people are prepared to go the extra mile in terms of care and compassion for animals. One of the steps is to say, we don’t need factory farming [or] animal products at every meal.” Defra said it does not comment on legal proceedings. However, a spokesman said: “We continue to promote the production of healthier, higher welfare farm animals. “All farms should implement strong biosecurity measures and report suspected disease immediately.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Peter EganDownton AbbeySwine fluHuman rightsImmune systemFluAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

David McCreadie believes a process called dredging is behind the deadly illness which has had a devastating effect on wildle in recent months. Hundreds of pet pooches have reportedly been struck down after walks on beaches along Yorkshireaposs coast over the past few weeks. Meanwhile dead crabs and rotting lobsters have been littering the coastline between Marske and Saltburn in North Yorkshire, while piles of crustaceans have been spotted in Seaton Carew and Seaham in County Durham. Mr McCreadie said he saw a vessel dredging off Teesmouth near the North Yorkshire coast in late September.The former senior lecturer in marine biology and oceanography believes this process has released historic toxins from the bottom of the sea, reports Yorkshire Live.It comes after a fisherman reported that there are no crabs or fish for miles off Yorkshireaposs coast and that he has to survive off just £ a month.  Investigators have ruled out dredging as the cause behind these events but Mr McCreadie claims a two-week operation unearthed historic toxins off Teesmouth and the dredged material was dumped three or four miles off the coast. He has called for more samples to be taken by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairsand for Government labs to test specically for cyanide and deadly dioxins. The expert, also a member of the British Divers Marine Le Rescue, has been keeping an eye on reports of dogs falling ill after walking on the beaches which some believe is linked to the piles of dead sea creatures washed up on the shores. Mr McCreadie said he is . per cent certain that the dredging operation unearthed toxins left behind from a century of dumping in the Tees river. In November , the Environment Agency rejected chemical pollution as a likely cause and investigators have said dredging, sewage and undersea cabling activity is not to blame either. More than , potential chemical contaminants have been screened and inspectors said no anomalies that could lead to an event of that scale have been found. Defra is now leading the investigation and said samples of dredged material had to meet high standards before it could be disposed of at sea. A spokesperson said Environment Agency tests on crabs and lobsters also ruled out chemical pollution.

And the bond with his dad Prince Charles is one that has especially felt the strain of late. Last year, in his bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey, Harry accused his dad of cutting him off financially and not taking his calls. In addition, Harry has also appeared on the Apple TV series The Me You Canapost See, where he spoke about the royalsapos total neglect and the Armchair Expert podcast, where he lashed out at Charlesaposs parenting. And just last month, one report claimed relations between the pair were at aposrock bottomapos and that they were barely speaking. However, with the turn of the year, there have been claims of several olive branches, which appear to show that their icy relationship may be starting to thaw... Fatheraposs pride One of the first signs that Harry and Charlesapos relationship could be improving was just days into the New Year. It came in an essay that Charles wrote for Newsweek, where he issued a call for urgent action to save the environment.In the piece, he praised both Prince William and Harry for their work in raising awareness of the issue.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.Months earlier, at her speech at the Cop climate change summit in Glasgow in November, the Queen name-checked both Charles and William for their work in saving the environment, but there was no mention of Harry. However, in the essay, Charles spoke about how he was proud of both William and Harry for having recognised the threat of climate change. He said: Most recently, my elder son, William, launched the prestigious Earthshot Prize to incentivise change and help repair our planet over the next ten years by identying and investing in the technologies that can make a dference. And my younger son, Harry, has passionately highlighted the impact of climate change, especially in relation to Africa, and committed his charity to being net-zero. Enjoyable video calls Shortly after the Newsweek essay was released, the Mirror revealed that Charles had held several “good-natured and enjoyable” video calls with Harry. Sources close to Charles said that despite reports of the two not speaking, Charles and Harry have been on “a journey of rediscovery” in terms of their relationship. One said: “The Prince of Wales has spoken to his son frequently in recent months. He loves him very much, as he does both his children, and he looks forward to them being able to spend time together in the near future.” Missing grandchildren And not only does it appear that Charles is missing his son and daughter-in-law Meghan, he is also desperate to see their children.Charles hasnapost seen two-year-old Archie since the family moved to Calornia and he is yet to meet his seven-month-old granddaughter Lilibet. One source said: “The Prince of Wales has been saddened that he hasn’t had the opportunity to spend time with his grandchildren, which he really does miss. “He is a fantastic grandfather and loves playing the role immensely and it’s certainly fair to say he feels there is something missing from his le without the ability to get to know Harry’s children. Invitation to stay Meanwhile, another olive branch Charles has extended to his youngest son is an invitation to stay with him when he and his family next visit the UK. The offer of bringing the family together for the first time since Harry and Meghan decided to quit their royal roles and set up home in Calornia was made by the heir in the lead up to Christmas, it is understood. But Charles’s good-natured plan, in an attempt to heal the rt between him and his son, has been thrown into doubt after Harry suggested awould come at “too great a personal risk” due to his security situation.  Harry claims he is “unable tohome” after a decision following his exit from the royal family stripped him of his right to personal security provided by the Met Police. He has since decided to sue the British government by applying for a judicial review against the decision, which could see him face the Home Office at the court.Meanwhile, a report today suggests Charlesapos invitation comes amid fears over what Harryaposs memoir, due out this year, will say about Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.Those fears are said to revolve around Harryaposs recollections of Camillaaposs entry into the Royal Family and how her romance with his father damaged him from a young age. Secret talksHowever, itaposs also said that Harry himself reached out to his dad with the pair having secret talks to heal their rt before the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee celebrations. A royal insider told the Sun : “There has been a definite thaw in relations between Harry and Charles. They are on much better terms and have been having friendly chats and video calls.“It has been suggested to Harry he may live to regret any lingering family bitterness, and he has taken that on board. “There is a feeling he is coming back more into the fold and wants to be closer to his family.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince HarryPrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It spoke of the Queen and Prince Philipaposs fury after Andrew was pictured with topless women and touring red-light districts on a holiday in Phuket, Thailand. The Sunday People at the time revealed the Duke of Yorkaposs new friends were nicknamed the NyLon Gang because they went between New York and London with no expense spared.  Among the people in the gang was Ghislaine Maxwell, who it was said took Prince Andrew to nightclubs and parties.An insider told the Sunday People back in : Andrew has been told in no uncertain terms that he must cut loose from this gang with all their drug links before it drags the reputation of the Royals into the mire. His behaviour is not that expected of the Duke of York and he has been told it must end right now. Andrew is laying himself open to exploitation and scandal and is becoming an appalling liability. What sort of example does he set to the rest of the world  Reports have said Prince Andrew went on tours of red-light sex clubs with billionaire paedo Jeffrey Epstein and holidayed with pimp Ghislaine Maxwell while in Thailand. In a set of infamous photos, the Duke of York played up to his Playboy Prince moniker when he was seen surrounded by topless supermodels partying on a yacht off the coast of Thailand seaside resort, Phuket. Maxwell and Epstein were said to have been on the same holiday as Andrew, with the former thought to have stayed at his hotel. And the manager of a venue in Patongaposs red-light district said he was graced with a regal visit when the British prince visited the topless go-go bar. The wild holiday, which took place in New Year in , was around the time Prince Andrew became close with the couple - and just months before he allegedly sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre.  Andrew has vehemently denied this allegation and claims there was nothing improper about his relationship with the couple - who were both convicted of child sex crimes in the US. The Duke of York splashed out £,-a-night on a private villa at the lavish and ultra-exclusive Amanpuri Hotel in Phuket - where the couple also stayed, reports say. A Phuket-based journalist known as Lana told The Sun Online the resort is the go-to place for high-profile figures who need a high level of luxury and privacy.Spending his days on yachts with scantily-clad women, by night the Prince reportedly teamed up with Epstein to visit Patong - a notorious sex tourism hub where the streets are lined with go-go bars, massage parlours and other adult entertainment venues.  The pair visited the Banana Disco - a popular tourist nightclub which advertises itself online with videos of women wearing not much at all. The Queenaposs second son was said to have repeatedly visited a bar called Crazy Girls by Rock Hard, which is in a raunchy area where many of the girls are prostitutes.On Facebook, it says punters can enjoy the craziest and sexiest ass-smacking bar.Speaking to The Sunday Mirror at the time, the manager said: I was amazed to see the Prince here.

Alex Gibson, , had been on a night out with friends in Blackpool on Thursday, July  last year when the tragedy occurred. He had spent some time with his friend over the course of the evening but the pair separated when she went to Sapphires nightclub in the resort. In the early hours of Friday morning, Alexaposs friend called him from the North Pier and told him she didnapost want to live anymore. Alex raced to the seafront and went into the water to try and help her despite not being able to swim.An inquest at Blackpool Town Hall today heard that she got out and went for help but Alex was then found face down in the water less than an hour later, Lancs Live reported. Alex had met his friend while working at C Fresh Fish and Chips in Foxhall Road. Speaking at todayaposs inquest, she said: We were near the steps [to the right of the pier].  We were both in the water together. I was trying to help Alex because he couldnapost swim. We were hanging on to each other trying to keep each other afloat. I realised that the only way we were both getting out wassomeone got help so I told him that I was going to get out and get help. It took me a while to swim back because the current was really strong. After she managed to get out of the water she shouted back to Alex to tell him it would be okay. He was just trying to stay afloat, she said. I remember seeing him get further out. He was shouting for help. Mark Wright, who was sleeping rough in a shelter on the Promenade, said he was woken at .am when he heard Alexaposs friend screaming: Alex I canapost live without you. Giving evidence at the inquest, Mr Wright said he could see Alex struggling to keep his head above the water, but then lost sight of him because it was dark.  David Langton, who had also been asleep in a shelter, woke up when he heard Mark shouting to him: Get on your phone David thereaposs someone in the water. [Alexaposs friend] told me she wanted to kill herself, Mr Langton said in a statement. She told me her friend couldnapost swim. I tried to look for him but I couldnapost see anything. PC Ryan Kavanagh of Lancashire Police was driving down the Promenade at around .am on Friday, July  and pulled over when he saw Mr Wright at the side of the road. He asked meI was there because there was someone in the water, PC Kavanagh said.  I drove to the other side of the pier... below was [Alexaposs friend] near the wateraposs edge. She was covered in a blanket. She informed me she had been in the water, she didnapost want to be here anymore, and her friend had followed her to save her. She told me sheaposd kill herselfAlex was deceased. Leboat helmsman Sean Wright, who has volunteered with Blackpool RNLI for  years, was involved in the search for Alex. The crew spotted Alexaposs friendaposs white Primark handbag floating in the sea and  minutes later, at .am, found Alexaposs body face down in the water  metres from the shore. Alex was taken to Blackpool Victoria Hospital where resuscitation efforts continued but he was pronounced dead at .am. The medical cause of death was given as drowning with alcohol intoxication listed as a contributory factor. Dillon Dixon had known Bradford-born Alex for  years after the pair met at school and the two friends shared a house together. They had been out together on the Thursday night and Dillon had gone home at around pm. The following morning at .am, not knowing that his friend had just been declared dead, Dillon woke up and jokingly text Alex saying hope youaposre alive. Weaposve all jokingly sent similar after a night out, Dillon said.  The inquest heard Dillon, who had offered to take Alex to swimming lessons, thought of him as being like a brother and the two friends went through everything together. He was a proud vegan and had a heart of gold, Dillon said. He enjoyed going to Stanley Park to feed the birds. Alex has in the past had many dark thoughts and said he was tired of everything. He was always sad inside but had the biggest smile on his face. The inquest heard that although Alex had self-harmed in the weeks before his death and occasionally had dark moments there was no evidence he had deliberately taken his own le. Concluding that Alexaposs death was a result of misadventure - the unintended consequences of a deliberate act - Senior Coroner Alan Wilson said: Disregarding his own welfare, as someone who could not swim, this young man bravely went in the water and tried to save a vulnerable young girl. Anyone who has seen the tide at Blackpool when itaposs fully in knows it is dangerous. Itaposs most likely he got into dficulty pretty quickly and he was witnessed by someone trying to stay above the waterline. He could not survive. Alexaposs dad, who attended the inquest, said that he had wanted to place a permanent memorial to his son close to where he drowned. He added that Alexaposs colleagues have raised the money to install a bench in Stanley Park. After Alexaposs death his boss at C Fresh posted online: Alex was truly an amazing young man. All his friends would agree that he was intelligent, hardworking, pleasant, caring and literally wouldn’t hurt a fly. He is a true hero drowned sacricing his le to help another. He was loved by all his work colleagues and we miss him terribly. Tragically taken at .

For breakfast every morning, he would eat sausages, eggs and bacon for breakfast, two Dominoaposs pizzas for lunch and a Chinese takeaway for his dinner - along with more snacks. Wearing XXXL clothes and with a waist that stretched to  inches, Tobie - who was an insurance broker at the time - was left ‘shocked and embarrassed to discover his weight was  stone.He began his journey to change his lestyle in September , binning the daily fast food, chocolate and ice cream diet to focus on boxing.After just over a year, he has lost more than  stone and has set his sights on turning professional as a boxer by the end of the year. He admitted it was a tough journey and that he would have ‘eaten himself to death’he had not made the changes and shaken his addictions to ‘calories, grease, fast food’. Tobie said: “Iaposve always had a real issue with food. It was a comfort thing for me growing up and it continued through my adult le.  When I was , I was playing rugby at a reasonable level but whenever I got an injury and couldnapost play, I was still eating asI was training. I just got bigger and bigger. Around  I decided to focus on my career but this meant I let my health get even worse. I ballooned from  stone up to  stone. I couldnapost put my own socks on. As his weight grew, Tobie decided to dropdown the levels so he didn’t have to train as hard and could focus on his insurance broker job. He began to pay even less attention to his health and his daily diet saw him consuming up to , calories a day while he continued his desk job. He said: “I was a food addict. It was the only drive or pleasure in my le outside of working so food was my getaway. I was at work one day and they brought the scales out for everyone to check their weight. I thought I was going to be  stone and that I was just a few weeks off the weight I had been previously. When I stepped on them, I was  stone and I was just so embarrassed about how big I had become. I was wearing XXXL clothes and had a  inch waist so I was massive.I started to get really ill - I was fatigued, couldnapost get out of bed, constantly had headaches. I was tested for diabetes and thyroid problems but it turned out to be the physical signs of depression. In order to kick his addition to unhealthy foods and to lose weight, Tobie set about going cold turkey on his favourite foods. I had to treat it like a drug addiction and go teetotal on most of the foods Iaposd eaten before, so no chocolate, takeaways or crisps. I felt awful at first, really ill. I was having withdrawal symptoms for the first few weeks, which was me coming off the copious amounts of processed foods and chocolate Iaposd been used to. I was addicted to calories, grease, fast food, the whole lot. My diet was abysmal so I had to change. If I hadnapost, I think Iaposd have eaten myself to death. Iaposd like to think Iaposve added  to  years on to my le by reversing the years of destructive eating.” He said he turned to boxing because rugby wasn’t inspiring him anymore and he knew he had to try a new challenge. He said: “Iaposve always been a boxing fan and I decided I needed to set myself a goal that kept me on track. I decided to train to become a pro. “I looked for help from a few people but I realised I had to do it myself. Once Iaposd lost a little bit of weight and gained confidence, I joined a boxing gym and started working by myself on the heavy bags. It has just snowballed from there. Iaposve had a couple of amateur fights since covid restrictions have been loosened and Iaposve been sparring regularly with experienced pros.Tobie set up an Instagram and TikTok page to keep him accountable. “Iaposve never been happier,” he said.The only thing that I feel which is slightly negative is that I didnapost do it earlier. I feel bad that I let it get to the worst and didnapost change my le sooner. Itaposs been a huge year of change. Itaposs helped my mental health massively too. I left my job as an insurance broker to start selling motorbikes as Iaposve always loved them. I need to get some more fights under my belt before I can go pro as well as sorting some sponsorship for travel. ”I was meant to be fighting at the end of January but that has been delayed as I have had covid. Weaposre looking to get as many fights in as possible this season.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cadbury Ltd.Dominos PizzaFast foodIce creamMental healthChocolateWeight loss success stories\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Bonnie Elizabeth Morgans weighed an astonishing Ib oz when she was born  weeks premature on September , . Bonnieaposs mum, Rachel Morgans, , said her daughter broke the record as the youngest gestation to survive at Leighton Hospital in Crewe at  weeks and one day.Rachel said the cut off at Leighton Hospital is  weeks, so Bonnie could have been classed as a late miscarriage, but doctors gave Bonnie a chance after she showed a apossign of leapos. Thankfully, Bonnie came home for the first time on January , and her mum has spoken to CheshireLive about her experience. Rachel said: At the end of May , I found out I was pregnant because I thought I had appendicitis, but I never did.Bonnie was a twin, and I had miscarried the twin, so thataposs what the problem was. Bonnie was a suspected ectopic pregnancy, so basically they thought she might have been in the entrance of the fallopian tube.After a few scans, they decided that Bonnie could be a viable pregnancy, so we went ahead with it. Weaposve had quite a bad pregnancy. We had lots of bleeding and stuff like that, mainly due to the miscarriage and all that going on. Then on the th September at . Bonnie arrived in this world after like an hour labour. It was a very short labour. In Leighton Hospital, the cut off is  weeks, so Bonnie would have been classed as a late miscarriage, but the doctors that were on that day, and the midwe, who Bonnieaposs gets her middle name from, decided they would give Bonnie a chance,she showed a sign of le, they would give her a chance.  Bonnie came out and cried. Because she cried they said she showed a fight for le, so they did and pushed for her and sheaposs here today. Rachel said it was a aposreliefapos when she and her husband Adam Morgans heard Bonnie cry, but that their thoughts then turned to what was next for the baby. She said: I just assumed that she would never survive to be honest. Iaposve had a premature baby before at  weeks, my eldest, and I thought that was bad enough when she was born at  weeks. So I think me and my husband, when the labour started, we just assumed that she would never survive and that she would be born stillborn. But when she cried it was a relief, but it was also a bit like aposOK, so what does this mean type of feeling, weaposve got something  to deal with nowapos. Bonnie has such a horrendous time because she was transferred to Arrowe Park Hospital because they canapost look after a baby at Bonnieaposs gestation at Leighton, it needs to have what is called a tertiary care unit.  So she had to go to Arrowe Park. They have kept her alive to this day, but sheaposs had two cardiac arrests, sheaposs had surgery at Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital because sheaposs got whataposs called ROP [retinopathy of prematurity], which is basically from the oxygen that sheaposs needed to survive has damaged her blood vessels in her eyes. So sheaposs had to have laser eye surgery. You name it, this kidaposs had it. Sheaposs had the works. Bonnie came home on Thursday eveningfor the first time since her birth in September. Rachel said: Sheaposs on oxygen at home, but sheaposs on very minimal oxygen. Even though sheaposs like a Ib oz baby, sheaposs very tiny still. She looks like a newborn baby now. Sheaposs got whataposs called chronic lung disease now because she needed such high respiratory support. So sheaposs going to have that probably for the rest of her le, but theyaposre hoping they can get her off oxygen by her first birthday. Up until sheaposs around seven, she will be seen by a lot of neonatal consultants and paediatricians just to make sure that she does meet her milestones andthereaposs anything they can do, they will intervene to help us, but other than that they canapost see why she wouldnapost live a normal le at the minute. Bonnieaposs two older siblings, -year-old Imogen and two-year-old Ralph, were excited to welcome their baby sister home. Rachel added: It was quite a shock to them because we didnapost tell them we were bringing Bonnie home. We just pretended that we were having a meeting at the hospital and we just came home with her. I think everybody was just a bit in shock. Ralph has been so excited. He wants to help do everything. I think for Imogen, because of her age, sheaposs aware of whataposs been happening during our time at Arrowe Park and things, so for her itaposs just a relief that itaposs over and we can all be back together again now because since September we havenapost all been as a family unit.

No woman should feel coerced into breastfeedingshe doesn’t want to, but I’m in favour of making it as easy as possible for her to breastfeed her baby and for them to bond. One of the greatest deterrents for mums is nipple pain. More than seven out of  of first-time mothers report nipple and or breast pain in the first week after giving birth. And the most common cause is inadequate latching on, as described by medical ­practitioner Lisa H Amir and colleagues. Latching on refers to how the baby takes the breast into their mouth to suck, and unless a new mum is shown how to do this, it’s dficult for her to achieve a good latch.  Many new mums don’t understand that the whole nipple, including a lot of the areola, has to go in the baby’s mouth. If not, the baby ends up “chewing and chomping” on the nipple causing bruising and painful breaks in the skin. It’s excruciating when the baby suckles. No wonder a woman wants to stop. It’s worth notingthe pain is continuous it’s unlikely to be ­inadequate latching.  If nipple pain occurs only with breastfeeding, the diagnosis is more likely to be latching dficulty. Other conditions, however, can cause nipple pain during ­breastfeeding such as surgical scars or nipple piercings. Both very long nipples and “flat” or inverted nipples can be painful too. Conditions of the breast itself may contribute. Fullness and hardness of both breasts may indicate engorgement. Redness might signy a blocked duct mastitis . If swelling and redness is marked, and spreading across the breast chest, it’s cellulitis. With engorgement, both breasts are “full”, tender and tense. A blocked duct or mastitis can cause tenderness in a section of breast that may be swollen and hard. With mastitis, the breast might be inflamed, firm, and lumpy. It’s also possible to have allergic dermatitis caused by using a nipple cream.  There again there are conditions where breast pain, or the perception of breast pain, is unrelated to ­breastfeeding such as fibromyalgia and muscle pain. A baby’s so-called tongue-tie is sometimes quoted as a cause of nipple pain, but it rarely is because it rarely truly exists. This leads to many babies having unnecessary tongue-tie surgery. It’s easy to blame tongue-tie for inadequate latching but it’s rarely the cause and parents shouldn’t use it as an excuse for both nipple pain and poor feeding. Most “tongue-ties” ­disappear as the baby grows.

But when she grew up, Jasmine was dubbed aposflat packapos by school bullies who would cruelly joke about her unusual name.

What do you think about the name Ikea  Let us know in the comments...Jasmine, who changed her name in , said: I used to get called flat pack quite a lot at primary school. The bullying really shocked me because young children donapost know about Ikea. I legally changed my name when I was in secondary school. Itaposs only legally that I get called Jasmine.

Maps published at the start of the year show a sea of black as the highly infectious iant tore through the country.  But cases have dropped signicantly in all regions - although infections remain high in parts of Northern England and the Midlands. It comes as the Government announced Plan B measures are being lted and Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the country is moving into the next chapter in the battle with the virus.  The North West, Yorkshire and The Humber and the West Midlands are currently experiencing the highest infection rates. London, which was the epicentre of the Omicron outbreak in the build-up to Christmas, has seen cases drop dramatically, and now only the South West has a lower infection rate. Cases in each region currently stand at:Yorkshire and The Humber - ,. cases per , people West Midlands - ,. cases per , people South West - . cases per , people South East - . cases per , people North West - . cases per , people North East - , cases per , people London - . cases per , people East of England - . cases per , people East Midlands - . cases per , peopleOn January , the Department of Health announced , infections in  hours, but in less than four weeks that has dropped dramatically. Yesterday afternoon the Government said there had been , new cases on Saturday. Last week the Government said it was moving into the next chapter in the battle against Covid.Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said he is optimistic the legal requirement for people in England to self-isolate with Covid can be lted in the coming weeks. Mr Javid said the Government was approaching a decision point and that it would be guided by the data in coming to a judgment.The current legislation is expiring in March unless Parliament decides to renew it. As a Government we have to make a decision on that, he told the BBC Radio  Today programme.We will make it in the next few weeks but it will be guided by the data at the time. From what we are seeing at the moment, from the case numbers, hospitalisations, the direction we are travelling at the moment, I am optimistic but I donapost want to say exactly what will happen in March. But I do want to see a time as soon as we can to remove all remaining rules and restrictions around Covid because we do have to learn to live with this virus in the same way we have learned to live, for example, with the flu. A World Health Organisation chief earlier warned that Europe is only passing the halfway mark of the pandemic - and said Covid should not be likened to flu. The WHO says governments should not suggest to people that the data has suddenly changed or the virus has suddenly got incredibly weak.Dr David Nabarro, the WHOaposs special envoy for Covid-, said that the end was in sight but said that Europe was only passing the halfway mark in a marathon.Asked about remarks that Covid- should be treated like the flu, Dr Nabarro told Sky News: I keep wondering what the people who make these amazing predictions know that I and my colleagues in the World Health Organisation donapost know. You see, what people are seeing from around the world and reporting to the WHO is this is still a very, very dangerous virus, especially for people who have not been vaccinated and whoaposve not been exposed to it before.

The claim came as US experts cast doubt on reports the Duke of York was looking to offer an early £ million settlement to Virginia Giuffre. Earlier this month, it was revealed Andrew, , had found a buyer for his beloved Swiss retreat, and the purchase was proceeding. Undoubtedly the sale would help fund Andrewaposs mounting legal costs in his civil lawsuit with Ms Giuffre, who has filed a civil sexual abuse case against him in New York. But now, an attorney for Jeffrey Epsteinaposs victims has revealed the deal appears less about paying her off, more about preventing her from claiming on the Dukeaposs assets.  If Virginia gets a judgment against Andrew,this went all the way through to trial and she received a financial judgment in her favour, she could execute on any properties he has, the most likely being his ski chalet, said lawyer Spencer Kuvin. If Andrew had properties in any companion country that would abide by such jurisdiction of the US, she can execute on those properties. Asked whether Ms Giuffre could make a claim on Andrewaposs -room Royal Lodge home in Windsor Park, which he shares with his ex-we, Sarah Ferguson, Mr Kuvin said it could not be ruled but would be very very dficult. A diplomatic conversation would be needed to be had, but I imagine it would be unthinkable that it would come to that, he said. Mr Kuvin warned: If the Queen has transferred any property to him, anywhere throughout the entire world, they could try and execute on that propertysuccessful in foreign courts.  Due to US courts having no jurisdiction over the UK,Ms Giuffre were to win her case, she would need to apply in Europe or Britain to have any damages enforced. Despite Switzerlandaposs famous financial secrecy, the assets and proceeds of an inidual are not protected there under law. Giuffre could execute on the chaletshe obtained a civil attachment order. According to Yves Klein, an asset recovery lawyer from Geneva-based law firm Monfrini Bitton Klein he states Swiss law ensures items and valuables belonging to an accused or to a third party may be frozenit is expected that the items or assets will be used as evidence, will be used as security for procedural costs, monetary penalties, fines or costs, will have to be ed to the persons suffering harm or will have to be forfeited. Mr Kuvin described speculation the Prince was preparing to offer a £million settlement to Ms Giuffre to dismiss her lawsuit as premature.  He added: Any offers or speculation about offers at this point is very premature. My guess is that they fight this as long as they can and only settle at the last minutethey feel they must. Giuffre, , has sued Andrew using New Yorkaposs Child Victims Actthat allowed those abused to sue their attackers. In , lawmakers introduced a look-back window that gave victims of decades-old abuse two years to file civil claims by August , , eventhe statute of limitations had expired. The deadline for claims was later extended due to Covid by then New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mum-of-three Ms Giuffre, who lives in western Australia filed the lawsuit on August ,  - just five days before the window closed.  She claims in , she was trafficked by billionaire Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell to have sex with the Duke in London when she was , a minor in US law. Giuffre also alleges she was forced to have sex with the royal at Epsteinaposs home in New York and the US Virgin Islands. The Duke, , absolutely and categorically denies her allegations. She is suing Andrew for unspecied damages, which Mr Kuvin said could easily be in excess of £ millionshe is successful. Most of Andrewaposs wealth has been tied up in his multimillion-pound properties, including the ski chalet he bought eight years ago. Some £ million is accounted for by the Royal Lodge, once the home of the Queenaposs sister, Princess Margaret.  Although it is owned by the Crown Estate, the Duke splashed out a further £. million on its refurbishment when he and his family moved in, so he could expect afor his money. Previously, father-of-two Andrew was given Sunninghill House as a gt when he tied the knot with Fergie in . In , six years after the coupleaposs orce, he put the home up for sale but could not find a buyer for more than five years. The home was purchased in  by Timur Kulibayev, the son-in-law of the former president of Kazakhstan, for £. million, several million over the asking price. The Duke is reportedly still earning money from the Queen after being banned from carrying out royal duties.  However, he has reportedly been stripped of the £, in public funds he received each year that saw the taxpayer hand him millions of pounds over decades. Andrew stepped down from royal duties following his car crash BBC Newsnight interview in November  about his friendship with Epstein. He is reportedly receiving an income from the Duchy of Lancaster - a private estate owned by the Queen consisting of , hectares of land in the UK. It includes assets in Cheshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, Lancashire and the Savoy Estate in London. The body earns Her Majesty around £ million a year. However, it is not known how much of this is paid to Andrew.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of York\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It was certainly a day to remember, with a celebrity guest list, a stunning wedding dress and a decent amount of social media ban rule-breaking. The bride and groom couldnapost have looked more in love, beaming throughout the public part of the day - but a lip reader has revealed Eugenie wasnapost entirely happy about one thing her new groom did on the day.  When they were sitting side-by-side in St Georgeaposs Chapel listening to readings, Eugenie jokingly said to her new husband: Why arenapost you holding my hand  The Queenaposs granddaughter took the lead and coached Jack through the day, with a letime of royal experience meaning she knew exactly what the crowds wanted. The lipreader revealed that the royal bride initiated the coupleaposs tentative smooches outside the chapel, saying letaposs kiss in front of the cameras. Jack spoke openly about his nerves ahead of the wedding, telling the Daily Mail: Iaposll need to take a few minutes for myself before the speeches because Iaposm terried. Itaposs very exciting but Iaposm a little bit nervous. He overcame his nerves, however, to whisper beautul words to Princess Eugenie as she approached him at the altar. Experts revealed he said Oh, my heart when he saw his bride, before adding Oh break my heart.  And it wasnapost just Eugenie who made some interesting comments at the wedding, and the Queen left guests stunned with a hilarious joke. Pixie Geldof, who was lucky enough to get an invite, chatted about the celebrations during a podcast with fashion designer Henry Holland, What Were You Thinking  She said: I didn’t meet her but she was walking around saying stuff like, ‘Well, it’s great that I have a house big enough to hold all these guests’. She’s full LOL. She was being funny. She was like, ‘Welcome to my home’. Pixie also explained that she had a rather embarrassing moment during the day, which saw her trip over in front of a group of other guests. She said: I fell over at one point. Stacked it, but not on to the floor. And not drunk – hadn’t drunk.

Yesterday, pictures showed H er Majesty making the emotional pilgrimage from Windsor Castle to Sandringham for a stay at the five-bedroom cottage Wood Farm. The cottage is where the late Prince Philip lived following his retirement from public le and is where the Queen and her beloved husband could relax together. Her trip comes just weeks after the Queen stripped her son Prince Andrew of his military titles and learned grandson Prince Harry was launching a legal battle against her government over his security. And speaking to the Mirror, royal biographer Robert Jobson, author of the book Prince Philip’s Century, explained it has long been a place of retreat for the Queen. He said: The Grade II-listed Wood Farm, located on a secluded part of the Queen’s Sandringham Estate looking out to sea, has long been a bolthole for the Queen and her late husband Prince Philip. It is where the Queen, Philip, and their four children went to relax for more than  years. And, of course, it is where Philip made his retirement home in his twilight years with the Queen’s blessing The Queen was known to cook and even do dishes while she was staying there.

It is now the place Her Majesty, now a widow, has chosen to go for a bit of privacy and reflection after a traumatic  months. With its simple furnishings and open fires, it is a lot less formal than le at Windsor, Buckingham Palace and even Balmoral, although it is spacious enough. When Philip was there, he didn’t stand on ceremony and servants didn’t wear the usual royal unorms.  Prince John, the youngest son of George V and Queen Mary who suffered from severe epilepsy and possibly autism, resided at Wood Farm from  until his death there in  and before Philip moved in, the younger royals too had several times held private parties at Wood Farm.The Queen usually spends the month of January and February at Sandringham - following Christmas - in order to mark the anniversary of her father George VIaposs death.He died at the estate in February  - and this is when the Queen officially became the monarch.  This year marks  years since George VIaposs death and Robert says it will be especially poignant as it is also the first year the Queen will face the milestone since Philipaposs death last April. He added: As has been tradition for many years, The Queen has travelled to her Norfolk estate at Sandringham every Christmas and usually stayed on until after the anniversary of her father King George VI’s death, on  February in  in Sandringham. Again, due to Covid protocols, she had to remain at Windsor Castle since the autumn – where she held muted celebrations with close family, including the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. This Ascension Day will officially mark  years as monarch following the untimely death of King at just . There will be no broadcast to the nation, for Her Majesty, who will be  in April, it will be a day in quiet, sombre reflection. Now without Prince Philip by her side, it will be even more poignant.

Laura Templar, , sent continuous emails and text messages to married father-of-two Patrick OaposConnor and his lover Caroline Decleves.She also swore at Mr OaposConnor as he headed to his office by Broadgate Tower in Bishopsgate in the City of London, Stratford Magistratesapos Court heard. Mr OaposConnor, a married man, became involved with Templar in March  when he was working as a construction worker at her luxury apartment block in Shoreditch. The affair was on and off for about a year before they split, with Templar later finding out that he had started another affair with Ms Decleves.  Margaret Bankole, prosecuting, said: Patrick OaposConnor is married and has two children. He worked in the same building where the defendant lives. The affair began in March  and lasted for two months. Then the affair was rekindled in March last year and ended the same month, which is when it is said the defendant began harassing him by constantly sending him messages, emails and text messages. She would also send text messages to his private phone number and his work phone number. He, on numerous occasions, told her she was harassing him and to stop messaging him. On one occasion she sent a text message when he dropped his we off at work stating that she knows he just dropped her off. At this point he was unaware how she would have known that. She purchased tickets to a work event he would be attending and he did not make her aware of that event. On  August at am, Patrick OaposConnor saw the defendant as he was walking into his office by Broadgate Tower.  They crossed paths. It is said the defendant shouted at him What are you still doing here  When are you going to f*** off. Youaposre a c***. Templar also shouted and swore at Mr OaposConnor in the street, on some occasions when he was briefing staff outside of work. Mr OaposConnor had an affair with his colleague Caroline Decleves who works as a concierge in the same building the defendant lives. The defendant began to harass her also, constantly sending emails, contacting her on ious numbers and shouting at her on the street. Templar, who works as an underwriter, told Mr OaposConnoraposs we about Miss Decleves and sent photos to him of his family and children. When Templar was interviewed by the police, she explained her behaviour as believing that she was owed answers, the court heard. Mrs Bankole explained: She said she was in shock as she really loved Patrick and she thought he wanted to be with her. She told the police that she asked him nicely to not stand outside where she lives however he continued to do so. She still sees them every day. When they see her they laugh and wave. Miss Decleves now no longer works in the building. Christopher Pickwick, defending, said: Miss Templar works from home quite often, she has had to see both parties on a regular daily basis knowing that they are seeing each other and that Mr OaposConnor had ended the relationship with her. She found it extremely dficult living in those circumstances. No doubtthey werenapost working so close to her she wouldnapost be in court today. Prior to Miss Templar being interviewed by the police the messaging stopped. Miss Templar in her words said aposI stopped of my own accord when I calmed downapos. Templar, of Bowl Court, Shoreditch, admitted two counts of harassment without violence between  July  and  August . She was given a  month conditional discharge along with a  month restraining order. Templar, who wept during the hearing, was also ordered to pay prosecution costs of £. District Judge John Law said: Obviously, it is a very sad day for you, at  years old to be in front of me having previous good character taken away from you by your guilty pleas. This was obviously an unfortunate and badly ended relationship. But you know that you took that too far in terms of what you did by continuing to contact and harass people who didnapost want to talk to you. Iaposm going to deal with this with a conditional discharge - one of the most lenient sentences I can give.

So few people suspected he was the one targeting his victims, raping them, killing them and dumping their bodies, often collecting several of their heads as sick trophies and performing sex acts on them after covering them in make-up.In one final sick insult to those he had murdered, he would oftento where he had abandoned the bodies and have sex with their corpses. Getthe newsyou want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. In a further gruesome confession, Bundy even admitted to eating parts of his victimsapos bodies so he could possess them and they would become part of him. The killer claimed he was addicted to murder, saying: You feel their last bit of breath leaving their body. You’re looking into their eyes. A person in that situation is God. Bundy was finally arrested, tried and sentenced to death aged , having confessed to  murders. On January , , the killer refused to eat any of his final meal - a standard-issue steak, eggs, hash browns and toast because he hadnapost picked anything.  He called his mother, Louise Bundy, who wasnapost present at the execution. It’s a circus and we didn’t feel the agony we would go through by going down there would compensate for a few minutes talking to Ted through the glass, she said. And he also felt that way too. Askedhe had any final words, Bundyaposs response was surprising. Hesitating, his voice quavering, he told his attorney Jim Coleman and Methodist minister Fred Lawrence: Jim and Fred, Iaposd like you to give my love to my family and friends.  The LA Times reported: With that, it was time. A last thick strap was pulled across Bundyaposs mouth and chin. The metal skullcap was bolted in place, its heavy black veil falling in front of the condemned manaposs face. Barton gave the go-ahead. An anonymous executioner pushed the button. Two thousand volts surged through the wires. Bundyaposs body tensed and his hands tightened into a clinch. A tiny puff of smoke lted from his right leg. Meanwhile, hundreds of revellers sang, danced and set off fireworks outside the prison, chanting Burn, Bundy, burn and cheering when his body was brought out in a hearse. Eleanor Rose, the mother of one of his victims, Denise Naslund, said: For everything he did to the girls - the bludgeoning, the strangulation, humiliating their bodies, torturing them - I feel that the electric chair is too good for him.  Following his death, scientists were determined to find out what had turned this seemingly upstanding citizen into a monster. Bundyaposs brain was removed and a series of experiments were carried out to determine why he had carried out his horric crimes. Some brain injuries have been linked to criminality by some researchers, and several serial killers have shared similar neurological profiles. Bundy had told the detective who was instrumental in bringing him to justice that when he felt the urge to rape and kill, it was like a chemical tidal wave washing through his brain which he compared to being addicted to drugs. But when scientists examined Bundyaposs brain, it was found to be totally normal, with no legions, injuries or deformities. When he was alive, examinations by experts suggested he may have had a multiple personality disorder, been a sociopath, a narcissist and exhibited poor judgement and manipulative behaviour. Dorothy Otnow Lewis, a professor of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine and an authority on violent behaviour, said a prison guard told her Bundy appeared to transform into a dferent person in front of his eyes. He said, aposHe became weird on me.apos He did a metamorphosis, a body and facial change, and he felt there was almost an odour emitting from him, she recalled.

Little Jamie Clarke was rushed to Alder Hey Children’s Hospital earlier this year after his mum, -year-old Ashley Hughes, discovered a lump on the side of his stomach. Doctors initially suspected the two-year-old was suffering from a viral infection because his glands were swollen but he was taken back to the hospital by his dad Jamie, , the following day. Nan Angela Daniels, , from Kensington, said Jamie’s dad noticed this lump again and “wasnapost happy” so he took him back to Alder Hey.They said it was constipation and again it could be his glands,” she told the Liverpool Echo. “Ashley brought Jamie to my house on Sunday and he didnapost look himself. He was very grey and white, he wasnapost sitting properly in his pram and he couldnapost really walk. Angela said Jamieaposs grandad Andrew was also concerned after seeing the lump, so took him back to Alder Hey. After undergoing blood tests, the family was told Jamie had anaemia and he was kept in hospital overnight. The results of further tests revealed the two-year-old had a tumour that was cm by cm in size, as well as polycystic cysts on his kidneys. They didnapost knowit was benign or cancerous at this point,” Angela said. Due to the amount of cysts on his kidneys, she said doctors were concerned that a biopsy could cause them to burst. So on January , he underwent an eight hour operation to remove the tumour and kidney. Doctors told Jamieaposs family the devastating news he had a Wilms tumour - a type of kidney cancer that primarily affects children. Angela said: It was horrible. We always thought the worst. We knew that it was something bad but we didnapost realise how bad it was. He doesnapost understand whataposs going on, I think thataposs the hardest part. Heaposs got a good support network around him he really has. I think Ashley is still in shock and still quite numb. The operation was successful in removing the tumour but Jamie must now undergo six months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy at Alder Hey and the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre in Wirral.Angela has set up aGofundme pagein the hope of raising enough money to take Jamie on a day out or on holiday once he has finished his treatment.She hopes sharing Jamieaposs story will help to raise awareness of cancer in children and encourage others to always go with your gut instinct and not be afraid to go back to the doctorsyou are concerned. In a message on the Gofundme page, Angela said: We thought we would try this to help us give our baby a day he deserves. He is our true super hero and I wish no one will ever have to go through what we all have been through.

Even a fibber as shameless as the charlatan in Number  cannot pretend he did not know a gathering with a cake and a rousing chorus of Happy Birthday by  revellers was a party instead of a work event.What more evidence is required by the police, Sue Gray, Conservative MPs, Parliament and the British people to conclude that Johnson broke the law, lied repeatedly when caught and is totally unfit to lead our nation  The Cabinet room bash in June  – held when families could not say goodbye to dying loved ones, funerals were tightly limited and singing widely banned – will be the final straw for many. Johnson has treated the public with utter contempt, every day he is allowed to remain in office adds insult to injury for those he took for fools. If he had any honour the Prime Minister would resign immediately.  Threat to world BY massing troops on Ukraine’s border in Russia and client state Belarus, ­authoritarian nationalist Vladimir Putin is doing far more than sabre rattling. The threat to unleash Europe’s biggest ­invasion since the end of the Second World War is an aggressive attack on freedom and democracy by a despotic leader. Invade Ukraine and the whole world loses as the economic, political as well as military repercussions will be devastating. Engaging Putin may not trigger sustainable peace but exploring every route to avoiding an invasion is better than fighting one off.

The new witness reportedly insists Christian Brueckner was calm while she was with him and says they were stopped by police who reported no suspicious activity. The German witness, who was living in Portugal in , believes Brueckner was miles away from Praia da Luz in Portugal on the day Madeleine went missing from a resort there. A source told the Sun: She says she was not with him the day Madel­eine disappeared but spoke with him and again said he seemed normal. The source said: This ­testimony could be an issue.  This comes just days after German journalists who were investigating the case claimed they have uncovered “shocking” evidence which “heavily incriminates” Brueckner. British youngster Madeleine was just three-years-old when she vanished from her parents’ holiday apartment in Portugal in . German prosecutors claim to have evidence she is dead and named convicted paedophile Christian Brueckner as their only suspect. Despite going public with the information in June , they have still not charged him with any offence.  But now a team working for TV channel Sat. have handed the evidence to detectives probing Brueckner over the infamous case. Sat. investigators claim to have found fresh evidence linking Brueckner, who denies any involvement, to the crime. They will reveal more information about their investigation in a prime-time documentary, which is yet to have an air date. Announcing the show, Sat. said journalist Jutta Rabe and a team of reporters gathered new information about Brueckner. They claim it includes proof he was near Praia da Luz when Madeleine vanished while her parents dined in a tapas restaurant. The channel said they collected “many new clues and indications” that corroborate the suspicions of German prosecutors.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Christian BMadeleine MccannMissing persons\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And the trick to doing it is so simple, but is something many parents donapost do as their children might not like it. In a message posted to the Cold Spring Harbor Fire DepartmentFacebook page an emergency responder revealed how shutting a childaposs bedroom door can make all the dference in the event of a house fire. The unnamed firefighter, who is a parent themselves, wrote: As a parent itaposs hard to convince little kids to sleep with the door closed, they always want it open just a little.  I do a lot of fire prevention at schools, so one thing I try and stress to kids is, how important it is to sleep with the doors closed. They go on to explain how there was recently a fire in a neighbouring area and share photos from the blaze - one showing a blackened, charred door, the other showing the back of the door which is still white. The homeowners and family dog are all doing well, they continue. The photos below are a great example of the importance of keeping bedroom doors closed while sleeping. The door pictured in both photos is a hollow core door to a bedroom. While the front of the door is severely damaged the closed door protected the bedroom and its contents. If this were an occupied bedroom the closed door could have saved a le. They added: The cause and origin of the fire are under investigation and believed to be accidental in nature. The post went viral at the time with over , shares more than , likes and hundreds of comments. Many were surprised to learn of the benefits of having a closed door.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.He responded: Another year closer to those senior citizen discounts. The woman didnapost find his comment funny, penning back: You can use this as a learning opportunity. I am completely secure in my age but saying that sort of thing to ANY woman will not go well. By saying it, I realise you may be too immature for me. Thank you and have a great night. He didnapost let the conversation stop there, and went back for more. You don’t like jokes  he questioned.  The man added: aposI am completely secure in my age!’ Proceeds to have complete meltdown over age joke. Yea I’m pretty sure that means you aren’t secure and there’s some insecurities there. Anyone  would play that joke off and get me back with something funny but you nearly had a breakdown. He added in his Reddit post that the woman didnapost respond after he replied to her. Other users slammed the man for lacking basic social skills, as they didnapost find his remarks funny either. All you had to do was say happy birthday, one person told him. A second penned: Hilarious you say she had a meltdown as you behave the exact same way. A third said: She literally told you it was her birthday and instead of saying ‘happy birthday’ or ‘did you get any cool gts’ you made a rude joke about her age. Another urged the man to be nice as they wrote: That’s the type of joke you make when you’re dating and super comfortable around one another. Be nice and tell her she looks gorgeous or do the ole ‘damn I honestly thought you were ’. Nothing beats knocking a few years off her age … she will love you after that. Try being nice.

Whilst Mumsnet user JukEki was thrilled to be invited along to two weddings in June, she couldnapost help but disagree with how the message had been sugar-coated to seem like it is a night off from childcare for parents.Taking to the website, she created a thread which was titled, aposTo be irritated by this wedding invite apos and ranted to anonymous users online. She began: We have been invited to two child-free weddings, both in June. We are going to attend both and are pulling in favours for childcare.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.However I can’t pretend that I’m not mildly irritated by the wording in one of the invites! Detailing what both invites said, she continued: One invite said, aposUnfortunately bearing in mind we have limited guest numbers we cannot accommodate everyone’s children however this is a golden opportunity for parents to enjoy a night of relaxation and uninhibited revelry!apos The second simply said, aposWhilst we love your children please note this is an adult-only occasion. But it was the first invite that didnapost sit right with the mum, who went on to list of her reasons for frustration.  She added to her post: The first annoyed me as actually it’s not going to be relaxing for me in the slightest, it’s quite inconvenient and expensive to not be able to bring the children and I’m more likely to be hand expressing in the toilets than dancing on a table. It is absolutely the couple’s prerogative to have the wedding they want including making a decision to have no children - just own it and say so instead of dancing around it and pretending it’s a night off for me. She concluded: Happy to be told I’m unreasonable - first also contained a money poem which may be biasing me. Thankfully, other users agreed with her and agreed that there was no need for the bride and groom to dress up the invite as a favour. One person commented: I agree with you. I hate it when they try to pass it off as doing the guests a favour. Itaposs a nuisance and an expense sorting childcare. I think the second wording is much better. Iaposm all for child-free weddings, but as you say, just be frank about and donapost dress it up as a favour. Another shared: Not unreasonable at all, and yes the appropriate response is ‘irritated’.They are trying to put a positive spin on their decision, but it comes across as patronising. It’s also the babysitter that is allowing you to be child-free for a night, not the wedding. However, it sounds as though it is well-meant and they just haven’t had the opportunity to know what they are talking about.It’s also one of those things people say at this kind of event when they have young children “oh it’s great to have a night off”. It’s true, and it’s a polite thing to say, but it glosses over the effort involved. They have probably heard this before and taken it completely at face value.A third concluded: Agree with you. For us, we like to spend weekends with our children, have no local childcare and I would pass on the “golden opportunity” to pay £ for childcare to attend someone’s wedding. I am from a country where I have never heard of or been to a child-free wedding. Children are accepted as part of le and families.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Instead of taking her to a hospital or doctor, Jason consulted a QAnon Telegram group chat with tens of thousands of people who think Covid is a hoax. Vice reported the conversation that followed.Jason wrote in the group: “Do you guys think it’s safe to give ivermectin to an infant ”Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medicine used to treat infestations in humans including head lice.  Two years ago researchers claimed it could kill off the virus which causes Covid, but there is no clinical evidence to support this and it is widely accepted amongst medical professionals that it should not be taken. The group however, was not medical professionals and they had spent months sharing tips on how best to obtain the drug. One group member responded: “Baby aspirin to thin the blood a little and drop any fever and I would put some ivermectin on the bottoms of her feet,”  Other conspiracy theorists on the chat said he should wait to take advice from “experts” in ivermectin, in the group. One so-called ‘expert’ called Katie said: “From what I understand, yes it is safe to give to an infant, however please stop calling it Covid, it’s not Covid, it’s a simple cold. That’s how we got in this mess to begin with.” Jason took the advice and gave his baby a dose of ivermectin. “We gave her two doses of ivermectin at mg each. That’s what was recommended by someone on here. She got really sick after that. Related  I don’t know.” Jason said. Within minutes Jason said that his little girl’s condition was worsening. He said: “Baby threw up. Is that common side effect  She’s also turning a tad blue.” Someone  said this exact thing had happened to their child, and that they then took their child to hospital.Jason said: “We don’t trust hospitals. I told my son to give her more ivermectin.”Group members begged Jason to take his daughter to hospital. One member called Barbara said: “That baby needs to go to the ER. Do not hesitate. “I’ve seen too many go south due to O levels being low. The blue is hypoxia and that’s lack of oxygen at the tissue level. Please!”  Jason eventually told the group he had taken his child to hospital. “[My] son is taking baby to urgent care. Against my wishes but I’m praying for her. It’s in God’s hands now.” He later said she was “doing better”. He added: “God knew what to do even though I thought hospital was certain death.

In Australia, the Therapeutics Goods Administrationhas placed restrictions on the prescribing of oral ivermectin amid a spike in demand.The TGA said: “These changes have been introduced because of concerns with the prescribing of oral ivermectin for the claimed prevention or treatment of Covid-.“Ivermectin is not approved for use in Covid- in Australia or in other developed countries, and its use by the general public for Covid- is currently strongly discouraged by the National COVID Clinical Evidence Taskforce, the World Health Organisation and the US Food and Drug Administration.” “Firstly, there are a number of signicant public health risks associated with taking ivermectin in an attempt to prevent Covid- infection rather than getting vaccinated,” it said. “Iniduals who believe that they are protected from infection by taking ivermectin may choose not to get tested or to seek medical carethey experience symptoms. Doing so has the potential to spread the risk of Covid- infection throughout the community. “Secondly, the doses of ivermectin that are being advocated for use in unreliable social media posts and other sources for Covid- are signicantly higher than those approved and found safe for scabies or parasite treatment. “These higher doses can be associated with serious adverse effects, including severe nausea, vomiting, dizziness, neurological effects such as dizziness, seizures and coma. “Finally, there has been a --fold increased dispensing of ivermectin prescriptions in recent months, leading to national and local shortages for those who need the medicine for scabies and parasite infections. “It is believed that this is due to recent prescribing and dispensing for unapproved uses, such as Covid-.

The threat of a Russian invasion has put Nato forces on standby and led the Foreign Office to begin withdrawing some staff and dependents from the embassy in Kyiv - where some British expats said they have bags packed ready to go west.Ben Garratt and his we, Alice, live in Queenaposs Park in London but moved to the Ukrainian capital at the end of the December to meet their baby and oversee official paperwork. Ukraine has very dferent surrogacy laws to the UK which means that itaposs much easier to work with an IVF clinic and a surrogacy agency here to have a baby that way... so Ukraine is an international hub of people coming for surrogacy services, Mr Garratt, , said. Weaposve always known that it would be a load of paperwork once he was born, for us to bring him home - but obviously, what was going to be a period of potential boredom, waiting in an apartment in Kyiv for two or three months, is now more nerve-racking. Unless we can get a passport for Raphael in the conventional way, orthat becomes impossible, the British Embassy get to the point they can give Raphael an emergency passport, we canapost leave - so it is nerve-racking.  Thanks to the process of getting a passport for new-born Raphael, the couple were always planning to be in Kyiv until mid-March. Despite international concerns of impending conflict between Ukraine and Russia, Mr Garratt, who works in stakeholder engagement at London North Eastern Railway, said Kyiv feels completely normal. Itaposs really strange...like Oxford Street on a Saturday... except for the snow, he said. It looks normal. Looking out the window... itaposs buzzing... thereaposs no evidence of panic buying, thereaposs no queues anywhere.  Iaposve never been in a country thataposs been invaded, I donapost know what that feels like, but it feels bizarre that it could happen . He and his we continue to keep in contact with friends and family who are nervous on their behalf. Weaposre nervous on their behalf, weaposre nervous because theyaposre nervous... thereaposs a lot of nervousness spreading through the family, he said. I guess there is a point at which we think, well, aposletaposs just go and seewe can cross a border and get to the UKapos... I donapost think weaposre anywhere near that and Iaposd be really surprised, Iaposd hope the British government wouldnapost let it get to that stage.  Jez Myers, a business consultant who has split his time between Manchester and Kyiv since , said while he is planning toto the city in mid-February, the major concern for many is the possibility of a cyber-attack. If a cyber attack happens, yougot to be concerned about heating, electricity, and cash, the -year-old said. Finding somewhere you can escape to, so: bag packed, clothing, water, chargers, grab your bag and get west...the mantra that most people are adopting. But news of embassy staff leaving is not a concern for Mr Myers.  Itaposs taking precautionary measures... my plan is toin middle of February as scheduled, he said. An IT director from Glasgow said has no intention of leaving his we and son in Ukraine as he maintains all is well. If the tanks roll and they are on the streets, that will bepain...I have no intention of leaving the flat we bought here, George, who has lived in Ukraine for more than two years and did not wish to have his second name included, told PA.are just being cautious... we live normally in Kyiv for now.

The troop of more than  primates were seen climbing over the vehicles, which were parked opposite the historical San Phra Kan shrine in Lopburi province in Thailand on January .Incredible footage shows the Simians dragging, biting, and ripping the rubber trim off of a pickup truck in an attempt to access the vehicle. Then another group of monkeys were seen trying to break into a black sedan that was parked next to it. Staff say that holidaymakers who leave their cars unattended are at risk of having the vehicles damaged.  These primates are known to swarm the vehicles - which may be rental cars - within minutes.Tourists are advised to park their cars further away. They are also meant to contact the local staffthe animals are stopping them from driving away.Panot Bunsi, one of the drivers whose car was damaged, claims there are now warnings about the wild animals.  The annoyed tourist said: I knew the monkeys pester people for food but I didnapost know they also attack cars. If someone told me before ofthere were warning signs, I would not have left my car. In March , the monkeys had an astonishing mass brawl over scraps of food. In February , dozens of monkeys took over a schoolaposs swimming pool and rummaged through the bins in search of food. Residents believe the monkeys brings good luck to the city.  Many of the monkeys congregate around an ancient Buddhist temple, but they have also taken over a cinema - forcing the previous owner to move out and close the business. Government officials have tried to control the monkey population without success.In , large numbers of monkeys were sterilised after their numbers spiralled out of control during the coronavirus lockdown, with well-meaning locals feeding them sugary drinks.Environmental officer Narongporn Daudduem said the department has a long-term plan to build a sanctuary in another part of the city, but plans are likely to be met with resistance from some of the residents who donapost want the monkeys living near them.

Mykul Myas said decided to order in some Mexican food so he could enjoy his cravings in the comfort of his own home. The -year-old from Baltimore, Maryland, USA, said he waited  minutes for his £. burrito bowl, but after going to eat his meal, he was shocked at what he found. Mykul claims his dinner had been completely polished off by the driver, who also left a nasty note stating that he had eaten his food because he did not receive a tip. The carpenter said: “I had a craving for Mexican food and I didn’t really want to go out and get it. “I decided to get it delivered. I ordered a burrito bowl and waited about  minutes.  “I then got a notication saying it was at my door, so I went to check and the bag had just been left there. “I didn’t actually see the person. I was planning to give him a tip in cash, but he drove away before I’d even had a chance. “I couldn’t believe it when I opened the box up to eat my food, and it was all gone. I was in total disbelief, and then to see that note there, it felt really personal. I honestly thought it was someone pulling my leg. I was disappointed, as I was really looking forward to the meal. I ended up just having some ramen noodles after that.” The anonymous note was left in the eaten bowl and read: “Leave a tip next time and this might not happen. “And don’t bother tryna [sic] get me fired. Going back to Amazon.” Shocked Mykul said he could not believe what had happened, adding that he had put some cash aside to give the driver a tip, but they had driven away before he got a chance.Mykul says he has also received an influx of cruel hate comments from strangers around the world after posting the photograph to Facebook, where it has since gone viral.He said: “I’m guessing the driver was just angry about me not leaving a tip in the app, so they decided to eat my food and leave that note. “After reading people’s comments, they were telling me that most delivery drivers make their money off tips. But I had no idea. “I was getting a lot of hate comments about not leaving a tip through the app. ButI had seen the person, I would have given them a cash tip, that was my plan. “People were telling me I got what I deserved and that I’m disgusting. Random strangers have been flooding my inbox with angry messages. “Half the people were laughing that it happened, and the other half were angry.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Food\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Serve the food you really want to eat by signing up for our tips and recipes and never be bored by your cooking againSign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Further investigation shows that the reflections match those of volcanic plains found all across the red planet. It solves the mystery as current temperature and pressure makes stable liquid water unlikely at the planetaposs surface, researchers have said.Scientists at the University of Texas at Austin believe that it could have been volcanic rock buried under ice that was seen in the  study. Lead author, Cyril Grima, a planetary scientist at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics , said: For water to be sustained this close to the surface, you need both a very salty environment and a strong, locally generated heat source, but that doesnapost match what we know of this region. The south polar mirage dissolved when scientists added an imaginary global ice sheet across a radar map of Mars. They found that the imaginary ice showed how the planet would appear when looked at through a mile of ice and this allowed them to compare features across the entire planet with those under the polar cap. Mr Grima noticed bright reflections, just like those seen in the south pole but scattered across the planet. And many matched the location of volcanic plains. Iron-rich lava flows on Earth can leave behind rocks that produce similar reflections and scientists suggest other possibilities include mineral deposits in dried riverbeds.  But eventhere is no liquid water on Mars, there is plenty of ice on the planet. Isaac Smith, a Mars geophysicist at York University, believes the bright radar signatures are a kind of clay made when rock erodes in water. He said: I think the beauty of Cyril Grimaaposs finding is that while it knocks down the idea there might be liquid water under the planetaposs south pole today, it also gives us really precise places to go look for evidence of ancient lakes and riverbeds and test hypotheses about the wider drying out of Marsapos climate over billions of years. The study, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, is based on three years of data from Marsis, a radar instrument launched in  aboard the European Space Agencyaposs Mars Express.

Declan Haughney, , insists that he was not trying to rob his deceased relative Peadar Doyle, , after he and another man dragged him for five minutes from his home to collect his pension from a Post Office in Hoseys, Ireland last Friday morning.Declan, , told the Irish Mirror he’s now “the talk of the town” and has been branded a “murderer” in the local community ever since the sensational story emerged. But he insisted he’s “not an eejit” – and believes he’s being accused of dragging his dead uncle into a post office to rob his pension – because he previously stole from his aunt. He said: “Why would I want to rob my uncle  I’m  years of age yeah, I’m not a child, I’m not a young fella. I’m not an eejit to walk into Hoseys with a dead man and collect his money. Am I cuckoo  Am I cuckoo  I’m not.”  Declan, who admits he used to have a drug problem, and who served two years in prison, says he’s now being accused of knowingly bringing his dead uncle in to get his pension – because of his past. He told us: “That’s why they’re saying it, that’s why this is all coming up now – because I done it before. A bank card came through the aunt’s door and I got the pin code and went down for fraud and that’s why this is all coming up. “People know about that in the town you know. But that was  years ago. I’m off the gear three years and I’m doing well.”  And Declan, who has a black eye and facial injuries after allegedly being attacked following the incident last Friday, revealed that he now believes his uncle was dead before he even reached the post office. Declan says he believes Peadar may have been dead by the time he and another male got him under the bridge at Pollerton Road, which is less than a two-minute walk from his home – but the pair continued to bring him to the post office by linking arms with him and dragging him there.  When the pair propped Mr Doyle up against the counter a member of staff contacted the Irish gardai.Both men, one of whom is said to have known Mr Doyle ‘very well’, have since made full statements to the police investigating the incident from Friday.  Officers believe he may have died around three hours before his impromptu trip to Hosey’s newsagents and post office in Carlow with the men, despite the claims that he was alive. Fr John Dunphy, the priest who delivered the last rites to Mt Doyle, said he received a call from police saying his remains had been left at the shop in ‘shocking circumstances.’ Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Post OfficePensionsCrimeFunerals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But over the years she has learned to love her grey hair and says she only needs to wash it once a month, making her le as a farmer easier. Anna, who lives in Hungary, says she sometimes only combs her knee- hair once a week when she’s busy working and explains how low maintenance it is.She says she feels honoured when she hears others being inspired not to dye their greys after seeing her hair. Anna proudly shares snaps of her stunning silver locks with her , followers on Instagram– although she has received some strange requests from men. Anna – who has over one million views on her haircare video – says: “It may partly be genetics, but I only wash my hair once a month because that’s how it behaves best. “And I don’t apply anything to my hair except some oil after I wash it to tame it and keep it manageable. “It’s honestly easier having long hair on the farm because you don’t have to style it and you can put it up in a bun. “Sometimes when I’m doing a lot of physical work on the farm, I can go for a week without brushing it and it’s fine. “‘I used to get picked on or stared at for my grey hair as a teenager but now I only get compliments. “I feel honoured when women write to me saying that they’ve found the courage to go grey because of me. It fills my heart with happiness. “There’s definitely a stigma with a young woman having grey hair and I would love to help change that. “However I will admit that I do get some strange requests from men online. A male follower offered to pay to lick my grey hair! I was lost for words.” Anna says that she was distraught when she started getting grey hair. She recalls: “I begged my mother to let me dye my hair when I began going grey. I was so sad and worried that I would look old. “I felt extremely self-conscious all the time. People would stare at my strands of grey hair and I would get remarks about it.  “I remember this incident when a boy called me ‘Cruella’ and it did hurt my feelings. “But over time, I learned to love my grey hair and it became an extension of myself.” Anna says she was inspired to grow her locks after reading folklore and she hasn’t had a proper haircut since she was  years old.  Anna, who works as a regenerative farmer with her boyfriend, explains: “I joined a folk-dance group as a teenager and became inspired by folklore imagery and women of history with beautul floor- hair. I wanted to emulate their hair and started growing it. “The last time I had a proper haircut was when I was fourteen years old. I went to the hairdresser and asked for a trim but the hairdresser chopped off far too much. “Since then I have never been back to the hairdresser. If I ever need to, I just ask my mother to give me a trim but that’s only once in a few years.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeenagersHairstyles\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Colleen Le, , said she offered to give her then boyfriend one of her kidneys because he was struggling to live with chronic kidney disease as a teenager. At just  years old, the unnamed man had to have dialysis treatment and told her his kidney was ing at less than five per cent. Colleen, from the US, says she made the decision to donate after a test showed the young couple were a match and they both made a full recovery following the successful procedure.But just ten months later, she claims he called things off after being unfaithful to her and accused her of going ahead with the transplant to look good. Colleen has gone viral on TikTok where she talks about her brutal allegations under the name @colleeeniie and has gained more than two million likes.  In one video, she said: I decided to get tested to seewe were a match because I didnapost want to watch him die. I was so nervous. In a later clip, Colleen explained that the coupleaposs relationship changed with her boyfriend claiming he was going to a bachelor party in Vegas with his church group seven months after the operation. The student said she was not concerned about the weekend getaway because he was a devoted Christian and that she decided to focus on studying for her exams. But she says she was shocked when he arrived home and admitted to cheating on her during the trip. A lot of arguments later, I eventually forgave him and gave him a second chance, Colleen said. But another three months later, he ended the relationship and saidwe are meant for each other, God will bring us back together in the end. In a further blow, Colleen claims he blocked her on all social media s and she now shares her heartbreak on TikTok. Many of her followers commended the student for saving her ex boyfriendaposs le and said he did not deserve her. Others criticised her for still telling her story years after the devastating events unravelled. One person commented: You have the biggest heart and he didn’t see it. His loss. Another person said: You deserve so much better, Iaposm so sorry this happened.Colleenaposs story echoes that of TikToker Uziel Martínez who claims he was dumped by his girlfriend weeks after donating his kidney to her mum.The teacher, from Baja Calornia, Mexico, told how his heroic move was not enough to save his relationship and that his ex has since married another man. Since his ordeal, he has also made several TikToks about the nightmare breakup as part of a recent trend.

We have been aware of all of the uncapped players for a while now and recently they have all experienced a breakthrough in terms of their performances at club level.“A key part of the squad selection was rewarding form and that definitely applies to Ben Vellacott and Rory Darge who have been excellent for their clubs this season.“We’re delighted to be able to include Cameron Redpath in the squad after missing the last few months with injury. He managed to get a game under his belt prior to the squad selection so we’ll see how he performs for Bath and in our training over the next couple of weeks.“The Guinness Six Nations is the best competition we have in rugby so to be involved in it is a real privilege, especially starting with our oldest rivals in front of a sold-out home crowd.”Forwards - Ewan Ashman - Sale Sharks, Josh Bayliss – Bath Rugby, Jamie Bhatti - Glasgow Warriors, Magnus Bradbury – Edinburgh Rugby, Andy Christie – Saracens, Scott Cummings – Glasgow Warriors, Rory Darge – Glasgow Warriors, Matt Fagerson – Glasgow Warriors, Zander Fagerson – Glasgow Warriors, Grant Gilchrist - Edinburgh Rugby, Jonny Gray - Exeter Chiefs, Nick Haining – Edinburgh Rugby, Jamie Hodgson - Edinburgh Rugby, Stuart McInally – Edinburgh Rugby, WP Nel – Edinburgh Rugby, Jamie Ritchie - Edinburgh Rugby, Pierre Schoeman - Edinburgh Rugby, Javan Sebastian – Scarlets, Sam Skinner – Exeter Chiefs, Rory Sutherland, George Turner - Glasgow Warriors, Hamish Watson - Edinburgh Rugby..removeBacks - Mark Bennett – Edinburgh Rugby, Darcy Graham – Edinburgh Rugby, Chris Harris – Gloucester Rugby, Stuart Hogg – Exeter Chiefs – Captain, Rory Hutchinson – Northampton Saints, Sam Johnson - Glasgow Warriors, Blair Kinghorn - Edinburgh Rugby, Rufus McLean - Glasgow Warriors, Ali Price - Glasgow Warriors, Cameron Redpath – Bath Rugby, Kyle Rowe – London Irish, Finn Russell – Racing , Kyle Steyn - Glasgow Warriors, Sione Tuipulotu- Glasgow Warriors, Duhan van der Merwe - Worcester Warriors, Ben Vellacott – Edinburgh Rugby, Ben White – London Irish."},{"url":null,"title":"sbc-apologises-twitter-followers-launch-investigation","story":"AN investigation has been launched after Scottish Borders Councils Twitter feed was targeted by \"anti-vaccination hackers\".On Saturday night, six tweets containing \" information\" were published on the site.The posts were purportedly from European medicines agency, EudraVigilance.The group said the messages were designed to \"deepen vaccine hesitancy\".They were quickly spotted and taken down by council staff who apologised and confirmed an investigation had been launched into the circumstances.A spokesperson for EudraVigilance said the latest incident appeared to be part of a long-running online \"disinformation campaign\".They told the Peeblesshire News: \"EudraVigilance is not an organisation in itself, but the central database for suspected adverse events reported by iniduals and healthcare professionals in the EU.“There is a disinformation campaign that has been running for months on social media, with visual elements similar to the one used by the hacker of the Scottish Borders Council Twitter account.“These visuals use EMA’slogo and the EudraVigilance words without the agency’s consent to spread  information and deepen vaccine hesitancy.”A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson told us: “We experienced an issue late on Saturday evening where six tweets were posted via our corporate Twitter account from outwith the organisation.“This matter is under investigation and we apologise to our followers.”"},{"url":null,"title":"groups-recognise-importance-talking-youngsters","story":"A MULTI-AGENCY approach is ongoing to combat anti-social behaviour in Peeblesshire.Peebles Community Council, local police officers, the Community Sports Hub and Tweeddale Youth Action are all playing their part to reduce incidents.And the general belief is that speaking to the young people in the community is a priority.Malcolm Bruce, from the community council, has organised a survey for youngsters to complete in school time.He recently appeared on ITV Border and said: “I represent the community council and it’s a subject we talk about every month at our meetings. The conclusion we’ve come it is that we are not going to get to the bottom of this till we talk to the people themselves, the kids who are getting involved in this and that’s where we are putting our effort at the moment.“We have secured the assistance of the local high school who are going to work with us on this, maybe through focus groups and with a little bit of talk perhaps we can find a solution.”Sergeant David Rourke said: “I don’t have all the answers and I’ll not pretend that I do. I wish I did, but I certainly believe what we need to do is engage the children and youths of the communities a lot better.“So what we’ve been trying to do is work in partnership with the high schools, the community council in Peebles and ious other organisations such as Youth Action Teams to address and ert the youth’s attentions from vandalisms such as what has happened in the play park to more productive activities around the region.“Generally when we have vandalism or any sort of crime we have feedback such as ‘where were the police’ or ‘what are the police doing to resolve this ’“The police cannot resolve this on their own. Resourcing levels as we know across the board in the UK as a whole means we cant have police officers on every street corner every minute of the day to prevent crime happening so what we need to do is work as communities to spot it happening in the first place.”.removeA number of groups in the area have also stepped up to help.Lori Lee from the Community Sports Hub said: “We’ve been working hard to try and get sport back up on the table and that’s something during COVID we have been unable to do. So the opportunity hasn’t been there for young people to get out and be active in sport and potentially this is a reason behind anti-social behaviour.”And Dave Hodson from Tweeddale Youth Action added: “Through our youth clubs in Peebles and Innerleithen we continue to offer activities and opportunities for young people to have fun. We offer a place where young people can access support, advice and where we can signpost further services.“And really through volunteering opportunities we try and foster a sense of community spirit within our young people.“It’s important to say as well that the vast majority of our young people do play an active role in community le and are fantastic.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-woman-placed-supervision-series-offences","story":"A -YEAR-OLD woman has been placed on supervision for the next  months as part of a Community Pay Back Order at Jedburgh Sherf Court.Lee Greens, of McLaren Court, Hawick, pleaded guilty to a series of offences.The offences included police assault, obstructing police, threatening or abusive behaviour and breaches of bail."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-shares-story-christmas-antarctica","story":"A GALASHIELS woman has joined a small percentage of people who have visited both the North and South Poles through her work on a Navy vessel.Only . per cent of people have visited Antarctica, and Kasey Easson, , is now part of that group.Kasey has been a member of the British Navy for almost seven years and this year spent Christmas aboard HMS Protector, a survey ship.“Over the actual Christmas period we were down in Antarctica,” said Kasey. “It was amazing.“We stopped off at little islands where we were allowed to get off and go for a little walk around, so I walked around an island called Horseshoe Island.”Over a six month period Kasey had journeyed from the North Pole to the South in her role as a supply chain logistician on HMS Protector.She said: “In the past six months I’ve been to the North Pole and the South Pole.“We went up north first, seeing polar bears and ice.“We had to test the hull to make sure it was stable enough for us to go down to Antarctica.“We also took scientists onboard with us who tested the ice to check the solidity of it for global warming and [to] record data.“Then we sailed from the North Pole all the way down to the south in six months.”Kasey told the Borderthat being one of a handful of people to have visited Antarctica and the North Pole was something she never expected to do.She said: “I never ever thought I would make it to both [poles].“They say it’s . per cent of the world’s population has been to Antarctica.”Protector is a survey vessel used to assist the British Antarctic Survey as well as other UK and foreign research stations in Antarctica and the southern hemisphere.During her time on the ship last year, Kasey and her colleagues delivered coronavirus vaccines as well as completing their other surveying duties.“We’re a survey vessel, so we survey the seabeds and create new maps, handing data to the British Antarctic Survey – we work very close with them..remove“We went to south Georgia and the Sandwich Islands where we supplied them with coronavirus vaccinations.”Now back in the UK, Kasey, who lives in Plymouth, has visited her family in the Borders to celebrate a belated Christmas with her loved ones.“I phoned by dad on Christmas Day but I was only allowed a half-hour booking so everybody could call their home,” Kasey explained.“Onboard as a crew we had a Christmas dinner, and then afterwards we had our ship’s raffle which we fund ourselves.“And then there are these red tins we get which are ship deployment tins which are sent to all ships on deployment over the Christmas period alongside bases – it’s like a charity tin that has little gts.”"},{"url":null,"title":"treatment-works-preparing-key-construction-delivery","story":"A SCOTTISH Water project in Peebles is “well under way”, according to developers.Work began on the site, which is south of the existing works on Bonnington Road, in February .And now construction workers are preparing for the delivery of Transportable Treatment Units which are being constructed off-site.A Scottish Water spokesperson said: “We are continuing to make good progress on the site.“The next major phase of the project involves the delivery of the Transportable Treatment Units which are being constructed off site.“This is arriving in  pieces over the course of two months on lorries.

with  minutes remaining to end the match as a contest, giving the score line a harsh look from a Pupils# perspective, having competed well with their lofty opponents for an hour of the contest.And while such defeats are always tough for a team#s players and management, they still offer valuable on-field experience for the young Pupils players in the squad, as they adjust to a higher, more physically demanding level of football in the West of Scotland FL.The Pupils have nine fixtures left to play this season – five at home and four away – and are on the road again tomorrowagainst second-placed Finnart FC, at Springburn Park.

At that time, the local authority said the land was allocated for “circa  homes”.However, Persimmon Homes has gone beyond that figure and is looking to create a residential development of “circa  units”.Twenty-five per cent of the properties, which would include terraced, semi-detached and detached homes, would be classed as affordable.Access to the new homes would come from two new junctions created on Lammermoor Terrace, while a SUDSwould be created in the east of the site.Various studies will make up part of any application to the council.If the scheme is eventually approved, the developer will have to agree a sum for contributions to a range of projects, including extending both Windygoul Primary School and Ross High School.A sum would also be agreed “towards the enhancement of community sports facilities at Polson Park”.Money would also go towards covering the impact on a number of junctions, including Bankton Junction onto the A.Representatives from Persimmon Homes East Scotland were available to answer any questions about the scheme last Thursday afternoon.A spokesperson for the company revealed that nearly  people attended the online event.They said: “We hope local residents found it helpful:  attended and  questions were asked.“The most frequently raised concerns were general disruption during construction and extra local traffic on Birsley Road and Lammermoor Terrace.“Anyone who was unable to join the consultation can find out more about the proposed development by going to persimmonhomes lammermoor-terrace and sites.google view lam mermoor-terrace“Those wishing to comment can still do so by submitting an email or via post before January .“We will be reviewing all comments and how they can be addressed within the next stage of our planning application to East Lothian Council.”"},{"url":null,"title":"investigation-continues-river-esk-pollution","story":"The Scottish Environment Protection Agencyand East Lothian Council have been working together to

Indeed, employment rates for this age group have reached record highs.“However, it is still the case that over % of people do not change their employment decision at age  purely as a result of the higher state pension age.“This is mainly because most people have already left the labour force before turning .

In contrast, in the most prosperous areas, female and male employment rates at age  rose by just  and  percentage points respectively.Jonathan Cribb, an associate director at the IFS, said: \"The sharp increases in employment have come in particular from those in poorer areas, and for those who have lower levels of education, suggesting that without a state pension they cannot afford to retire.\"But of the , extra -year-olds who are in employment, , are in full-time work even though only  hours of work each week at the National Living Wage would be sufficient for most to make up for the delay in the receipt of their state pension.\"Given that a quarter of people working full-time in their mid s want to work fewer hours, this suggests there may be an unmet desire for many approaching state pension age to be able to work part-time, or more flexibly, than they are currently doing.\""},{"url":null,"title":"letters-nicola-sturgeon-must-know-no-case-independence","story":"It seems to me that the reason that Ms Sturgeon concentrates on the process of independence – ie, endless referendums – is because she knows that there is no credible case for independence itself. She indulges in displacement activity in place of effective action.There is no economic case for Scottish independence. Every effort to produce one runs into the sands of hard facts and evidence, which show clearly that Scotland benefits from pooling and sharing within the UK to the tune of around £ billion annually and would be so much poorer after separation. And the EU will not ride to the rescue of a country with such a large deficit, without its own currency, no central bank and few foreign reserves.There is no historical case. Scotland is not a colony and is not suppressed in any way as part of the UK. Scots and Scotland have benefited greatly, and continue to do so, from being part of team GB.There is no cultural case. The lives and attitudes of city dwellers in Aberdeen or Glasgow are little dferent from the same sample in Birmingham, Bristol or Cardf. Rural le in England is much the same as rural le Scotland or Wales.There is no legal case. The UK is a unitary state formed by the willing agreement of all parties in the Act of Union and its legal status has never been challenged.There is no geographical case. We are  million people crammed on to a small island. The very idea of splitting it up into dferent countries in a world where size and influence matters could serve as the very definition of foolishness.And importantly, there is no democratic case. We had our referendum. The outcome was decisive and should put the question to bed for at least a generation.Instead of continually distracting the faithful with referendums that never happen, Ms Sturgeon should be considering why, after  years in existence, her party has dismally failed to create even the semblance of an evidence-led case for independence. Let me give her a clue: there is no such case, it does not exist, it never has.Alex Gallagher, Labour councillor, Largs.KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROADWHAT a tease that Nicola Sturgeon is. She told us in May that a vote for the SNP was a vote to support her management of the Covid crisis. Now she tells us that voting SNP meant supporting her next push for Indyref, for which she claims a mandate. She has promised her troops a referendum before the end of , and she will soon set out the legislative timetable for her referendum.Yet Ms Sturgeon also tells us that the course of the pandemic remains \"highly unpredictable\". Further, the Holyrood legislative timetable has no mention of a referendum bill. That is before Ms Sturgeon encounters a no-doubt-polite refusal from the UK Government to sanction a second referendum. She admits that she hasn’t decided on the date for the introduction of the referendum bill, but she will take that decision in the next few weeks, to enable a referendum to be held before the end of .We have been here before, year after year since , and in each year the can has been kicked a bit further down the road. I don’t think any of us needs to keep our diary clear for a referendum in . That noise you hear is the can being kicked down the road again.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh.WHY WE NEED A YES VOTEI MUST concur with Ken Mackay . If ever we needed convincing of the need for self-determination, the need to run our own affairs, the evidence is all there. The illegal prorogation of Parliament, parties while the country was in lockdown, dodgy decoration donations, Tory MPs breaking lobbying rules, the list could go on and begs the questio:, why would we want to be part of this scandal and corruption Over the last month or so the media has reported that there is still plenty of support for Boris Johnson south of the Border, highlighting Mr Mackays point about separating from voters around London. It is predicted here in Scotland that the Conservatives will be wiped out at the next Westminster election, revealing the clear gap between voters in Scotland and those in England. Scotland seriously can’t afford another Westminster Government she did not vote for, she can’t afford any more legislation from Westminster regarding reserved matters and she certainly can’t afford Mr Johnson for a day longer than necessary. I finish as Mr Mackay finished his letter, independence is about being in charge of our own affairs, that is all.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk.* I WAS in a queue of about four people waiting for a sausage roll in Glasgow at the weekend.

There will be little talk of the enormous problems he tackled successfully, the health problems including intensive care and lately with his family just intense speculation on a successor – followed by a frantic searching for dirton that successor possibly going back to schooldays and a cigarette smoked behind the bicycle sheds. I suspect that there will follow a similar trashing of the leader of the Labour Party by the extreme left in order to re-instate their man.Is this what we have sunk to as a nation, no longer seeking people of actionbut media-attractive popular personalities  No longer talking about a desire to serve, but an unhealthy grasping at power for powers sake  No longer outlining what we hope to achieve in the next  months but how much we will spend usually multiplied over three or five years because it looks better and hides any temptation to link spend to success  No longer putting forward solutions to problems but articulately outlining that something is a challenge and expecting praise for identying it Heaven help uswe ever have to go to war –we do find a leader with the courage to make the dficult big decisions – we, through the media, will drag him or her down with distracting information or demand openness that will render a successful outcome impossible.James Watson, Dunbar.THE GLOBAL AGGRESSORIT looks asUkraine is heading for meltdown, leading to the general public fearing Russia and its territorial aspirations, as that is what we are repeatedly told to do.Last year, just like every other preceding year, one country alone was responsible for more than  per cent of all the money spent on Planet Earth on weapons of war meanwhile the standard of living of its own citizens is in decline. Since its creation, that itself by war, other than for five years, that rapacious country has been continuously involved overtly or covertly in armed conflict in some distant part of the globe: it currently has in the order of , servicemen stationed abroad, many actively involved in fighting and killing in at least six countries, on occasion against the wishes of their elected governments. Annually it gives military aid of . billion to one foreign government which is used to further the apartheid policy of its recipient against its indigenous population. The country I describe spies electronically on the general public of its allies to circumvent unhelpful legislation that prevents their own governments from doing so without specic legal permission. Its historic clandestine involvement in the politics of Ukraine is likely to cause a war which could spread to other European states. So we have every right to be afraid of this country, the only thing being that I’m not describing Russia, but the United States.The facts are that in  US military spending was  billion, Russia bn and the UK bn. There is nowhere in the world where there is stre that the US military industrial complex doesn’t have a finger in the pie, and to keep the profits rolling in people must die.David J Crawford, Glasgow.SLAVE TRADE-OFFI DO wonder what the history meddlers of Edinburgh and wherewould make of the following: “In  AD after a four-month Viking siege of the stronghold that was Dumbarton Rock a flotilla of  boats took prisonersto Dublin where they were sold as slaves” .Dan Edgar, Rothesay.Read more: We need an inquiry into slavery review controversy"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13407684.jpg?type=article-full","title":"sides-rewilding-debate-wrong-says-author","story":"But, says Ben Rawlence, who looked into the story of the tree while researching his beautul and affecting book, The Treeline: The Last Forest And The Future Of Le On Earth, this is a species with a more complex story.The pine that we see across Scotland is actually of two distinct genetic lineages and was brought to our shores by humans. One was brought by the Celts from the Iberian peninsula, the other by people from Ukraine.These two populations of Scots pines remain, thousands of years on, genetically distinct, and also separate in distribution.The pines brought here from the Iberian peninsula cover the landscape to the west of Loch Ness, those from the Ukraine occupy the east of that line.One of the reasons Rawlence finds them so interesting, he says, is because they are part of a much wider story, which he tells, of how humans and trees have long been interlinked.“What I hope people take away, overall, is that the way that the boreal has evolved in lots of dferent places is contingent upon humans. It has always been. We have always been entangled with its destiny. We have co-evolved together. And that’s just as true for the larch as it is for the spruce as it is for the Scots pine or the birch. The reindeer grazing create the conditions for the birch. It’s all interlinked.”He tells the story of six key species which form the treeline, Scots pine, birch, larch, spruce, poplar and rowan, and how climate change is impacting not just their distribution but the lives of the people who have lived for millennia alongside them.But it’s the Scots pine I most want to talk with him about. I’ve long been a lover myself of the tree – the way its branches stretch their needles this way and that seeking out the sun, throwing expressive shapes. I can remember the realisation that this tree that cloaked the edge of Scottish lochs, was the same that filled the air with pine scent between holiday campsite and beach in France.That was an early glimmering that this tree we call Scots may not be ours, later confirmed when a Swedish friend talked about a pine she called simply the Tall, which, when she found it here, would remind her of home. The tree we call Scots has many homes, and many peoples have a relationship with it.You only have to go back around  years to find a history in which Scots pine is arriving as an invasive species, brought here from the Iberian peninsula and Ukraine. The name tells us little about where it really came from, and more about the colonising role that Britain had in global history.As Rawlence puts it, “All of this stuff is tangled up with everything  – the dominance of Britain and colonialism how we see and name things.”Research into genetics and archaeology has uncovered these stories of the tree’s past.: Fellowship of the rings: Why we must protect our ancient trees“The provenance,” says Rawlence, “of the western group of Scots pine is quite well established. They were brought from Iberia by Celts moving up the river estuaries. There’s quite a strong archaeological record of the pines moving up the west coast of Britain and then spreading into Caledonia on time scales which were much faster than they would have been had they been regenerating naturally. The only plausible explanation is that they were brought by humans.”The Celts from Iberia were, he says, effectively travelling “with their own habitat, the pine”, the tree that provided them with food and other resources, with flour even, which could be made from its bark. Meanwhile, people from Ukraine, where a refugium of Scots pines had lingered since the previous Ice Age were also taking their special tree with them. Recent research has shown that the eastern population of Scottish pines is genetically very similar to those pines. Again, it was people who brought the tree, as they migrated across to the Sami territories of Norway and then over the North Sea to Scotland.The tree and the people have both left their mark on the Scotland of today and its gene pools. The red hair of the Ukrainian migrants, and the black of the Celts, exist alongside the trees that they brought with them. Rawlence says that we even find traces of this migration in folklore and oral history. When he mentioned his reearch to ethnobotanist Diana Beresford- Kroeger, she immediately connected it to Celtic stories which tell of how Iberians met the Ukrainians somewhere near John O’Groats coming the other way. “There is a popular word for people of the Danube who had red hair that comes from this encounter. Those two pieces of historical evidence together with the oral history, are a lovely discovery,” he says.When we think about restoring the lost forests of Scotland, often it’s the native pine forest we imagine. But, had these people not brought the pine with them, we might be looking at a very dferent Scotland, with uplands covered with oak woodland. How does that knowledge, affect what kind of forest we might want to regenerate now Rawlence is keen that we don’t write humans, who, as he says, have co-evolved with trees, out of both nature’s history and its future. “I applaud the rewilding efforts, the efforts to recover nature,” he says. “But it’s worth remembering that humans were always there. And the sustainability of those efforts and those landscapes is going to be contingent upon some kind of human interaction – whether that’s farming, new kinds of wildle tourism, a hunting economy. We have to have a relationship and an entanglement with it. And hopefully these efforts should also be tied to social justice and access for everybody.”He touches on an important debate, in these times of increasing rewilding. We might ask ourselves what the aims of rewilding really are  What are we trying to restore, and in a time when, due to climate change, the conditions are set to change anyway “This is the central tension that I was trying to get to in the chapter on Scotland,” Rawlence says. “Both sides of the rewilding debate are looking back. You’ve got the existing conservation economy saying it was never like that. You’ve got the rewilding utopianism of a kind of pristine boreal forest, which we know by  years ago was already gone in the British Isles. Both of their claims, those dferent claims to the past, are incomplete.”It was his attempt to follow the boreal treeline – the northern line that winds across altitude and latitude and is the limits of where trees will grow – that brought Rawlence to the north of Scotland and the story of the Scots pine. Rawlence, who is not an ecologist, but a former Human Rights Watch researcher and political speechwriter, who has, in Wales, set up an education institution to teach “creative and adaptive thinking” called Black Mountains College. He started to look at this treeline zone when he was on the hunt for a good new subject following his book on Somali refugees, City of Thorns: Nine Lives in the World’s Largest Refugee Camp.“The Horn of Africa,” he says, “is a very sensitive area, just like the Arctic. Historically it has had a very stable, very narrow temperature range, with monsoons and very delicate climate patterns which are finely calibrated, which were being disrupted.” What he noticed was that all the “displacement issues, the conflict and the human rights issues” he was covering were connected to and driven by this “underlying change”.“I thought, well, the next thing I want to do is not just go somewhere cold but look at another place where climate change is visible. If we’re going to talk about climate change and we’re going to interrogate what it means, why don’t we go and look at the places where it’s been happening for a long time.”He went in search of a storyline, a way of communicating the enormous topic of climate, something that would enable him to talk about the way we need to “start thinking about our relationship with the non-human world, with other species.”In the treeline he found a story which touched on the lives of indigenous peoples, impacted by climate change, but in which trees were the chief protagonist. For the treeline, he observes, has been on the march. “They’ve been moving since World War One,” he notes.It’s a movement that in many other parts of the world is visible, and noticeable to those who live there. But not here, in Scotland, where, Rawlence says, “you’re not seeing the march because you don’t have the trees. They are gone. There’s only a tiny fraction left. Here in Britain we have been highly successful at annihilating our forest. We’ve got  percent tree cover which is the lowest number in Europe. We have annihilated our ancient woodlands, perhaps more than any other country on earth. Research has shown we are one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world.”Rawlence believes that it’s no coincidence that Britain which “was the driver of the industrial revolution, a pioneer of capitalism, and property rights and enclosure and clearances” has suffered such extraordinary nature depletion. One of the books he cites as having had a profound influence on him, when he read it  years ago, was John Prebble’s The Highland Clearances.“We’ve absolutely written the text book on how to drive nature to the brink in the service of profit. Wales and Scotland and Ireland, are all particularly interesting examples of that. Because the patterns of colonialism and exploitation are written in the landscape.”One of his first chapters revolves around his search for the treeline in Scotland. What’s notable about it is that it seems like the pursuit of some elusive phantom. We have over centuries so stripped our landscape of trees that we no longer know where they might grow, what their limits might be, but nevertheless, Rawlence went hunting for the Cairngorms’ very highest trees.What he was directed to by ecologists, was, he says, not exactly the treeline, but just the place that was the closest approximation to it. “They’ve got a competition going now to see who can geolocate the highest trees in the Cairngorms, amongst the Cairngorms Connect.”In theory, Rawlence says, “Scotland is on the boreal treeline”. We were formerly a “boreal nation” like some of our neighbours. “All of the species in Scotland are continuous with Norway and Russia and it’s exactly the same historical process and exactly the same band of climate niche for those boreal species. But nobody knows where the treeline is because the trees are gone. You don’t see the march.”This means that there’s a sign here that we are not seeing. “When you lose an intact ecosystem, you lose your early warning system. You lose your map of the territory. You lose your guide.”A combination of factors mean that we are not seeing the change. One is that many species are long gone, the other is that, Rawlence describes, we don’t have indigenous communities living so closely with nature as there are in other countries. “They notice for example in Russia that there’s a new grass on the block in the Taiga. They notice that there’s a new butterfly that nobody knows the name for. Whereas in Scotland the most sensitive species to climate change are probably already gone  years ago,  years ago. That’s why we don’t see it. It’s because it’s already gone and we don’t know what we’re looking for and we’ve lost.”Often it’s said that our landscapes are missing key species, the lynx, the wolf, the bear, the beaver, many of these so long gone that it’s hard to imagine the country with them. But it’s also, as Rawlence observes, we are missing humans living closely with the landscape.There are other losses too. We don’t have the kind of indigenous knowledge that Rawlence found in some of the other communities he visited along the treeline. “Our indigenous knowledge is very very lost,” he says. “There are little echoes and tremors and traces of it. But it’s been systematically destroyed through superstition and Christian hegemony for a thousand years. You find it in crackpots and the weirdo books in the funny bookshops. It’s also in the language. It’s in Welsh. It’s in Gaelic.”As we face the prospect of a climate crisis, we might want to dig deeper into the past. Knowing the factors that made that past unfold as it did, he says, is vital. “If you understand better the contingency of the past, then the future becomes mutable. It becomes possible. It becomes something you can change, rather than this horrible place of powerlessness and denial where the only response to climate change is to run away or to bury your head in the sand, or be cynical.”Meanwhile, the treeline remains elusive in Scotland. Is it here, or is it not  Might we, through regeneration, find where it should be  “What’s exciting about Scotland is thatyou take the overgrazing out of the picture then you’ll see what’s going to happen and where the treeline is. It might be already above the top of the mountains.” A key aim of Cairngorms Connect is to allow trees to re-establish up to the natural treeline.Perhaps, he even suggests the whole of the Cairngorms were once entirely covered with forest. Cairn gorm is Gaelic for ‘blue mountains’, and he theorises perhaps this is because of the blue-green of the pines.One of the messages of The Treeline is that we are going to have to soon face a future where the climate is dferent. For Rawlence is fairly sure that we are on that trajectory towards  degrees, not the . degrees that was the fragile goal of COP.“- percent of scientists agree that . degrees is impossible,” he says. “When I started this research  years ago, it might have been argued that . degrees was in reach, but there’s now the reality of physics to contend with. And the other reality which has been a feature in my le is the reality of politics and I just know that the system is not going to sht that fast. So evenphysically it was possible, politically I know the hard limits of where we are and I despair of the ability to sht.”Rawlence’s despair at politics partly comes from his experience of working within it. In the run up to the Iraq war, he was a speechwriter for Charles Kennedy and lead for the Liberal Democrats for the campaign against that war.: Rewild Scotland: \"Beavers in all rivers. Lynx and wolf back.”“I used to wake up,” he recalls, “with nightmares about Tony Blair, frustrated with the fact we could win the argument and popular opinion, and yet with oil and the US and [President] Bush it’s happening and there’s nothing you can do. I had a very visceral experience of the unresponsiveness of the democratic system. I saw how fossil capital was hardwired into the system. Not just fossil capital but capital more broadly, and that you cannot extricate capital from its principal energy source. Without fossil fuels it doesn’t work.”He places little hope in the processes of international summits like COP. He calls the over-focussing on emissions “carbon reductionism” and dismisses net zero as a “dangerous delusion”.“I think hopefully what the book shows you is that nature is really complicated, that carbon is a system that’s in flux all the time, with enormous volatility. If you want to use the econometric metaphor like net zero, then you have to acknowledge that this is  accounting.”Nature, he says, is “supremely complicated”. It’s those communities he features in the books who live closely with it that understand it best.Rawlence has uncovered a fascinating story about the history of the Scots pine in Scotland, but what about its future  There, what he has found is not nearly so lovely. Startlingly, he notes that climate change may mean that it disappears from our landscape. This is a prediction he came across in ious scientic papers, which to him felt “earthshattering”, but which he noted was not “front page news”, nor had it even really been explored by journalists.He first noticed mention of the possibility in an RSPB handbook to Abernethy forest and that referenced models from the Met Office and University of Oregon which talked about climate velocity and the survivability of Scots pines at ious latitudes. “It didn’t take much,” he says, “to join the dots and say thatthey were gone at  degrees north and we’re at , that means that they’re gone.”“It sounds shocking and it might not arrive on the timescales that the models predict, but at some point in the next centurythe warming trajectory continues as at present and we get to C in the next decade and C by , then yes it does mean that there won’t be any more Scots pines in Scotland.“That’s a terrible thought. But hopefully that will give people pause and they will start to engage more with not just rewilding, but nature recovery and strategic ecology and thinking more broadly about our landscape and how we relate to it and what we need from it.”The Treeline: The Last Forest and the Future of Le on Earth by Ben Rawlence is published by Jonathan Cape"},{"url":null,"title":"scots-pines-disapper-scotland-due-climate-change","story":"In an in-depth interview, Ben Rawlence said he came across this prediction, which he regards as \"earthshattering\" in a couple of dfferent papers which modelled the impact of climate change on the tree.  One was created by the University of Oregon, the other the Met Office. “It didn’t take much,” he said, “to join the dots and say thatthey were gone at  degrees north and we’re at  degrees north, that means that they’re gone.”READ FULL INTERVIEW HERE: Both sides of rewilding debate are wrong, says authorThe Met office paper predicted that, in Europe, the tree will be confined to areas of Fennoscandia, Russia and the Alps.  “It sounds shocking,\" he said, \"and it might not arrive on the timescales that the models predict, but at some point in the next centurythe warming trajectory continues as at present and we get to C in the next decade and C by , then yes it does mean that there won’t be any more Scots pines in Scotland.\" “That’s a terrible thought,\" he added. \"But hopefully that will give people pause and they will start to engage more with not just rewilding, but nature recovery and strategic ecology and thinking more broadly about our landscape and how we relate to it and what we need from it.”: Fellowship of the rings: Why we must protect our ancient trees Subscribe now for the latest arts TV nostalgia features environmental news and opinion letters from just £ by clicking here"},{"url":null,"title":"golfs-many-frustrations-make-great-leveller---nick-rodger","story":"Peering at my reflection, while mulling over the prospect of re-grouting my crow’s feet, I was reminded of the words of Mark Twain who suggested that “wrinkles should merely indicate where the smiles have been.” I thought to myself, “crikey, surely nothing could’ve been that hilarious ” as I gouged some dust out of my furrowed brow.And talking of general scowls and glowers  Well, there was a fair bit of mumbling and moaning over the weekend.Rather like a bad dose of sunburn, professional golfers can be a prickly, sensitive old lot.Trudging off one of the greens at La Quinta during the American Express tournament, Jon Rahm, the world No , embarked on a muttering, jumbled offensive that was picked up on a microphone as he ranted that the course was “a piece of s**t f***ing set up, putting contest week.” It wasn’t quite the erudite analysis of Bernard Darwin.Over in Abu Dhabi, Tyrrell Hatton, a man so explosive he actually keeps his clubs in an ammunition depot, fired off a prolonged, withering tirade against the par- th hole at Yas Links and growled, among other things, that, “I would love for a bomb to drop on it and blow it up to oblivion to be honest.”The seeds of his fury had been planted during Saturday’s third round when Hatton took an eye-watering nine on this long closing hole which scuppered his title defence. You could understand why his judgement was somewhat clouded by the red mist.I don’t know about you, but I do enjoy watching the leading lights hurling their toys out of the pram.Hatton groused and groaned that he couldn’t reach the green in two on a par-, the poor thing. To a casual observer, his whining must have seemed as ridiculous as the revelation that Prince Andrew got a maid to rearrange his teddy bear collection. In an age defined by distance, which can see par-s routinely reduced to a couple of hefty clatters, Hatton didn’t garner much sympathy from those who still like to see long holes protecting their par with a miser’s care. Having birdied the hole twice during the event, the th clearly wasn’t the untameable beast Hatton made it out to be.“Perhaps I may not be back,” he said after his final round with the kind of brattish sense of entitlement you’d get in the Bullingdon Club.Rahm, meanwhile, was essentially moaning that La Quinta was too easy. In the cosseted realms of golf’s  upper echelons, you’ll never please everybody when it comes to setting up a golf course.One thing you can guarantee, though, is that this grand old game will continue to tease and torment, whether you’re a Rahm, a Hatton or a hapless howker at the local municipal.Golf, wherever and however you play it, has a habit of infuriating. It remains a great leveller.AND ANOTHER THINGWhen Thomas Pieters made a barnstorming Ryder Cup debut for Europe in , the young Belgian had all and sundry on this side of the pond cooing like pigeons in a hot tub. Despite the USA’s commanding victory at Hazeltine, Pieters’ haul of four points from five led to many of us jubilantly declaring him a talisman of European teams for years to come. Even Rory McIlroy, who partnered Pieters to three wins out of three in foursomes and fourballs, was smitten. “Ive got a partner beside me for the next  years and Im not letting anyone  have him,” he said at the time. Those fickle golfing gods don’t dish out guarantees, of course.Pieters hasn’t played in the biennial battle since but his win in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, the biggest of his six career victories and his second in his last three starts, was another major stride back to prominence. A couple of days shy of his th birthday, Pieters is now st on world rankings.\"I kind of disappeared for a couple years I guess,\" said Pieters, who did manage a bolt-from-the blue win at the Czech Masters in  which was his only top-five in two years. \"I’m happy to be back.”There will be plenty in the European scene happy to see him back too.

Therefore the deadline for its commencement would be April, , .The new application, that went before OIC#s planning committee on Wednesday, sought to extend this deadline by an additional two years.On their website, Hoolan Energy said an extension would allow more time to connect to the national grid and provide more flexibilityany further delays occur.The new proposal also sought to increase the operational phase of the windfarm from  years to  years.Again, on their website, Hoolan Energy said that extending the operational lespan of the development would have meant increased energy production and carbon savings alongside increased socio-economic benefits.They added that turbine technology has become so advanced to the point that longer warranties and durations of consent are now commonplace.Once again, despite being recommended for approval by planning officers, the application was rejected by the committee.The clock is ticking when it comes to fulfilling a target set by energy regulator Ofgem, which asks for a total of MW-worth of projects to be in the pipeline before it gives the go-ahead for a new subsea interconnecter between Orkney and the Scottish Mainland.The deadline is December .Hoolan Energy’s two developments at Costa Head and Hesta Head account for around MW, while OIC hope to add a further .MW with its community windfarm project.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The eruption triggered a tsunami that destroyed dozens of homes, and volcanic ash has tainted drinking water.Since the pandemic began, Tonga has reported just a single case of Covid- and has avoided any outbreaks. It is one of the few countries in the world currently completely virus free. About % of Tongans are fully vaccinated, according to Our World in Data.Australian officials said  crew members were infected on the HMAS Adelaide, which left Brisbane on Friday.“They need the aid desperately, but they don’t want the risk of Covid,” Mr Dutton told Sky News.“We will work through all of that as quickly as we can.”It is the second aid shipment from Australia in which at least one crew member tested positive. A C- Globemaster military transport plane was earlier turned around mid-flight after somebody was diagnosed.Meanwhile, a cable company official said Tonga’s main island could have its internet service restored within two weeks, although it may take much longer to repair the connection to the smaller islands.The single undersea fibre-optic cable which connects the Pacic nation to the outside world was severed after the eruption and tsunami. vw,vw,px, px\"Ash blankets the island in the wake of the eruption That left most people unable to connect with loved ones abroad. For days, people could not get through on their phones, by email, or through social media.Since then, Tonga’s Digicel has been able to restore international call services to some areas by using satellite connections. Some people have been able to send emails or get limited internet connectivity.Samieula Fonua, who chairs the board at Tonga Cable Ltd, the state-owned company which owns the fibre-optic cable, said a repair ship had left from Papua New Guinea and was due to stop over in Samoa by Monday to pick up supplies. It should then arrive in Tonga by February .He said that all going well, the crew should be able to repair the cable by February , restoring the internet to about % of Tonga’s customers.A second, domestic fibre-optic cable that connects Tonga’s smaller islands to the main island could prove much more dficult to repair.Mr Fonua said that cable runs near the undersea volcano which erupted and may have been severely damaged and might need extensive repairs or even a replacement.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We agree with the WTA’s position.“However, coming onto the site we have some terms and conditions that are pretty clear and that is,you are coming on site with the purpose of disrupting the safety and comfort of fans, you’re not welcome. Butyou want to wear a T-shirt that says ‘Where’s Peng Shuai ’, you can come on site, that’s fine.“There was a suspicion around the motivation of that inidual coming on site but we’ve since contacted that person and told her that she’s welcome to come on site, she’s welcome to wear a T-shirt, but not bring a banner, because you can’t bring banners on site.“It doesn’t have anything to do with a political or commercial statement. Our security people are trained to take a common sense approach, and I think that’s in the interest of everyone.”Fans wearing Peng Shuai T-shirts were filmed entering Melbourne Park on Tuesday.Having kept a very low profile in the aftermath of Novak Djokovic’s deportation, Tiley has been more visible in recent days.Tennis Australia came under fire for its role in pushing for exemptions for unvaccinated players to enter the country, but Tiley dismissed suggestions the fiasco had damaged the tournament’s reputation.Volunteers for the Democratic Alliance Party have entered the #AusOpen wearing “Where is Peng Shuai” t-shirts.Craig Tiley sensationally reversed his decision to confiscate them. pic QoUhgrUjK—SportJanuary , “No I absolutely don’t ,” he said. “I think the reputation of the tournament’s been defined by what you see today. We’ve had more people from around the world watch the Australian Open than ever before.“The feedback we’re getting from our customer satisfaction surveys on site has been the highest, even higher than . The feedback we’re getting from our broadcasters has also been the highest. Eurosport put out a note this morning that they’re getting their biggest numbers ever.“No one person is bigger than the event. I think we’re going to end up over the next five days firstly with a great event and potentially with a couple of new champions.”Another hot topic has been around the issue of Covid- testing for players, who, along with the rest of the workforce, are being trusted to use the daily antigen tests provided.A post shared by Ugo Humbert Two players, Ugo Humbert and Alison Van Uytvanck, announced the tests they took to leave the country came back positive, and Alexander Zverev said last week that he believed positive cases were slipping through.Tiley said: “It’s really impossible to supervise , people every morning. We’re trusting the players are doing the right thing.“We know we’ve distributed thousands of antigen tests for the players, we’re getting feedback from a lot that they are continuing to do the right thing and we’re still getting some positives, so we know they are.“On our mandatory tests, we’ve been well below the community averages so the approach of mandatory wearing of masks and social distancing, as well as the testing programme, is hopefully going to help us get through this event with much lower positive case rates than the community.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We are now working with the dental sector to recover and reform services, and this £ million boost will help with that recovery.”Appointments for some routine dental treatments, such as dental check-ups, are limited at this time as dentists prioritise vulnerable patients and those with urgent dental needs. #HelpUsHelpYou pic dxbBeGUK— NHS Sheffield CCGJanuary , Shawn Charlwood, chair of the BDA’s general dental practice committee, said: “Any additional funding is needed recognition of the huge backlogs facing NHS dentistry.“After a decade of cuts a cash-starved service risks being offered money that can’t be spent. Hard-pressed practices are working against the clock and many will struggle to find capacity ahead of April for this investment to make a dference.“Until today not a penny of the Government’s multi-billion-pound catch-up programme had reached dentistry. This is progress but must be just the startwe are to rebuild a service millions depend on.”A number of reports from the patient watchdog Healthwatch England have pointed to serious problems to dentistry access throughout the pandemic.Healthwatch England found wide-ranging issues from people being asked to wait for three years for an appointment, others asked to conduct “DIY dentistry” while waiting for help and some felt they were being coerced into “going private”.Jacob Lant, head of policy at Healthwatch England, said: “This is a vital injection of money and will help tackle the spiralling crisis in dental access and affordability.“We are particularly pleased to see NHS England prioritising appointments for vulnerable people, including children, with many missing school and suffering in pain as a result of dental problems that were entirely preventable through routine care.“There still remains deeper and more systemic challenges in the dental sector that have been laid bare over the last two years, but we need to build from this and start to get the nation’s oral health back on track after this dreadful pandemic.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

Even a knock or a bump could accelerate the transformation of tissue to bone.Lucy explained that when she and her sister were born their toes were shaped like bunions, one of the “tell tale signs” of FOP.However, at the time little was known about the condition, of which there is no definitive treatment or cure available, and the twins were not diagnosed until aged eight.Zoe explained: “When I was five I fell and broke my arm and it never really healed properly. When we were diagnosed with FOP no-one knew much about it because it was so rare.“At the time it was much harder for our parents as they really took the brunt of it because we were children.“But even now it can still be very hard because we are the only people with FOP in Northern Ireland.”Lucy added: “Back when we were children there was hardly any information about FOP but one person we were able to speak to was Fred Kaplan in Philadelphia.“He was the only person who knew much about it and even nowanything goes wrong we can send him an email.“He dedicates a lot of his time to research into FOP and we are very fortunate to have him.”The sisters, who attended Slemish College, described what it was like growing up in Ballymena with FOP.Zoe said: “We are so lucky to have each other but going to school was dficult in the sense that everyone was able bodied and we weren’t.“We went to Slemish which was such a great college, however, I was quite clumsy so I had to use a wheelchair and it was a bit harder for me because I couldn’t go outside at break times and join my friends.”When Lucy was  she tripped and hurt the back of her neck and the resulting bone growth left her unable to raise her arms above her head. In the same year Zoe broke her leg and was left unable to straighten it.Lucy explained that just recently she experienced a flare-up resulting in her jaw locking.She explained: “Over the last six months I have had a couple of flare-ups and it has been really dficult.“I had swelling under my chin and I couldn’t open my mouth so I had to have liquids.“I just kept telling myself that it won’t last and will get better which it did and I am thankful for that because there are people with FOP whose jaws have locked permanently.”Both Lucy and Zoe share a positive outlook on le which comes from practicing gratitude and not worrying about things outside of their control. Zoe who has a keen interest in interior design works for Ivy and Gold and lives in Cloughmills with her husband Mike whilst Lucy, a content creator, lives in Ballymena with her husband Michael.Zoe said: “I couldn’t get a job anywhere. I knew what I was able to do but no-one would take a chance on me. When I got a job with Ivy and Gold I was so grateful.” For Lucy and Zoe the pandemic has been particularly dficult as they are unable to get the vaccine due to their condition.Zoe said: We are normally together all the time but during lockdown we were from dferent households so we couldnt see each other.Butyou needed to be looked after and needed help you were allowed to go to someone s house so I went to my parents. It was hard for me to be on my own.Neither of us can get the vaccine because we cant have anything injected into our muscles so we have to be very careful.The sisters dont know what the future holds for them but they are determined to “live for the now”.Zoe said: “You cant think too far ahead because we dont know what the future holds for us with FOP.“We think it is best to live for the now becauseyou plan ahead too much you are easily disappointed.”Lucy and Zoe are keen to raise awareness of FOP through their social media channels and particularly want to highlight what signs to look out for.Lucy said: A baby with FOP will have toes that look like bunions and some children will have a joint missing in their thumb.“Spotting these first indicators allows parents to find out sooner rather than later whether or not their child has FOP.A petition to dedicate funding into research for the condition was debated in parliament at the end of last year. Lucy said: “Ian Paisley spoke on behalf of us and did such a good job. He fought our corner and we were very appreciative and hopefully it will go through to the next stage.“At the minute FOP families and friends fundraise but it is extremely hard as there are not that many of us.”Last year Zoes husband Mike and his work colleagues from Spar, Doury Road climbed Slemish and raised pound for FOP Friends.They are also planning to organise more fundraising events for the charity which is the only one in the UK dedicated to supporting people living with FOP and their families.The charity actively fundraises to support research into a treatment and a cure for FOP and more information can be found on their website www.fopfriendsYou can also find out more about Lucy and Zoe by following their Instagram handles which are Lucy Fretwell: allthingsbeautullymade and Zoe Buxton: alittlebitofle "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642778651871.jpg--covid_19___fri_21st_january_figures.jpg?1642778651000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220121newscovid 19 fri 21st january figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

However Mr Kingston, its group leader on the council, said they would support flying the flag on July  to mark the Somme anniversary, or a day to mark the NHS – a suggestion put forward by Alliance.Andrew’s birthday is part of a list of designated days when the government advises the Union flag to be flown at council buildings.Although the decision is still to be ratied by the full council, Mr Beattie said a decision not to raise the flag would be the right one.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBrexit...UUP leader Doug Beattie during a press conference at Stormont.

Nobody is saying that you’re guilty. Innocent until proven guilty remains fundamental, but it shouldn’t fly.”Mr Kingston said much of the DUP’s concern had been over the lack of information received by his party ahead of last Friday’s meeting.“The DUP’s position remains that we want the Union flag to fly every day in Belfast as it does for the majority of councils across the UK,” he said.“Sinn Fein and the SDLP are only using this issue to remove another flag day. Our concern is that next year this day will be dropped all together. We do need clarity on the details. Will this be a one-off  Will there be support for that on a permanent basis ”Mr Kingston said that assurances were still needed on an alternative date.“We would support July  to mark the Battle of the Somme, or a day to mark the NHS,” he said.“That is our position. Regrettably, for all the talk of working together, the SDLP did not have the courtesy to communicate with us in advance of the committee meeting last Friday to seek an agreed way forward.“We share concerns about the seriousness of the allegations of misconduct by Prince Andrew.”SDLP councillor Donal Lyons welcomed what he described as a “DUP u-turn” and said he was glad common sense had prevailed on the issue.“The DUP’s belated change of stance in this is welcome, as is the support for this move from the UUP,” he said.Despite claims by the DUP that they were blindsided by my proposal, we were open and transparent from the start, I made this proposal in advance of last week’s council meeting, including my offer to work with unionist councillors to find an alternative day to fly the flag.”On the Alliance Party proposal, councillor Nuala McAllister said there was little time for council to raty any decision had it not been brought forward in the committee meeting.“Had this been brought forward at council we would have had to wait until March for it to be ratied and that would have been too late,” she said.“We have followed proper process, but this is a non-argument. We’re all on the same page. It is council’s responsibility to reflect the feeling in society,” she added.“There are serious questions around his judgment.”She added: “The Alliance Party has said that the flag should fly on an alternative date We are not trying to stoke any fires.”Related topicsDoug BeattieBelfast City CouncilMore On Doug Beattie PremiumMalachi O#DohertyOpinionTime the middle ground made a stand for what they want PremiumEimear McGovernOpinionTweet has undone some of Doug Beattie’s good works PremiumEdwin Poots doesn’t rule out official complaint over Doug Beattie’s joke PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionChange is in the air... and it could have lasting ramications as poll shows Sinn Fein could take First Minister’s position PremiumMark BainOpinionIntegrated education remains Rubik’s cube conundrum for NIMost ReadFionntan McGarvey ‘lit up the sky with his smile’, funeral of tragic GAA player toldEdwin Poots says we is ‘disgusted’ over ‘joke’ as UUP leader Doug Beattie apologises in AssemblyBelfast man Jon O’Hara one of two Ravenhill Road crash victims - mancharged with causing death by dangerous drivingOur ‘simple’ le – Jamie Dornan’s we Amelia Warner on keeping things normalLuxury million-pound Co Down home with breath-taking views of Belfast LoughTop VideosPlayVideo: Surfer rescues two people after kayak overturns in PortrushPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy Latest PoliticsWaiting list crisis: ‘It’s a disgrace, there’s no doubt my eyesight has deteriorated due to delays in treatment’‘Solutions needed’ for hospital waiting list crisisWaiting list crisis: ‘I’m living in a painful limbo at the moment — and I’ve no idea when operations will resume’UK Government’s immigration bill ‘dehumanises vulnerable people’Eimear McGovernOpinionTweet has undone some of Doug Beattie’s good worksLatestNottingham Forest come calling for yet another Northern Ireland youngster, Coleraine’s Bobby Jack McAleeseKing bolsters his Gers options with Accrington loan duoLarne reject Cltonville’s bid for Ronan Hale and vow striker is future of the clubJohn SimpsonOpinionProblems need solved with NI ProtocolJoe Biden hits out at reporter with vulgar insult,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Sean Gallup Getty ImagesSteven AlexanderJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNuclear submarine commander-turned-MLA Steve Aiken says the West needs to stand up to Russian threats and aggression as appeasement will only lead to wider conflict.The former Ulster Unionist Party leader was speaking as the UK began withdrawing some staff and their families from the British embassy in Ukraine amid fears of an invasion.Read MoreCiarán Dunbar:OpinionA large-scale war between Russia and Ukraine would change the politics of the whole continentBoris Johnson said “gloomy” intelligence suggested Russia was planning a lightning raid on Kyiv.The Prime Minister warned President Vladimir Putin an invasion would be a “disastrous step” which could see Russia bogged down in a bloody and protracted conflict.Mr Johnson added he did not believe war was inevitable, and there was a chance “sense can still prevail”.But confirming the exit of some diplomatic staff, he said: “We do think it prudent to make some changes now.“The intelligence is very clear that there are  Russian battle groups on the borders of Ukraine, the plan for a lightning war that could take out Kyiv is one that everybody can see.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “We need to make it very clear to the Kremlin, to Russia, that that would be a disastrous step.”He warned Ukraine would resist any incursion, and “from a Russian perspective,is going to be a painful, violent and bloody business”.“I think it’s very important that people in Russia understand that this could be a new Chechnya,” he added.Downing Street said British troops would not be used to defend Ukraine.But the South Antrim MLA urged a “strong stance”.“Following any policy of appeasement, as lessons from history show, only leads to further, and wider, conflict. The only person drawing comfort from this is the occupier of the Kremlin,” he said.“Here in Northern Ireland we need to realise that not only has our nation already been directly attacked — twice — with chemical and radiological weapons emanating from Russia, our health service and critical infrastructure has been constantly under cyber-attack, our energy security has already been challenged, and that we are not immune from this conflict.“We should be standing strongly beside our Defence and Foreign Secretaries as they call for stronger action we should also — as we hear so often about the ‘benefits’ of the EU from some quarters — be calling on all of the EU to act cohesively against Russian aggression, and maybe, for once, the Republic of Ireland, as a temporary member of the UN Security Council, could actually take a strong stance and encourage their German friends to realise,  years on, that appeasing dictators never leads to good outcomes.”Yesterday Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said plans by Russia to hold naval exercises  miles off the coast of Cork were “not welcome”.They will take place in international waters, but within Irish controlled airspace and the country’s exclusive economic zone. Russia informed Ireland’s aviation authorities of the planned activities in advance.Speaking ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers, Mr Coveney said: “I have made it clear to the Russian ambassador in Ireland that it’s not welcome.“This is not a time to increase military activity and tension in the context of what is happening with and in Ukraine at the moment.”He added: “Russia, under international law, can take military exercises in international waters, but the fact they are choosing to do it on the west borders of the EU, off the Irish coast, is something that is in our view not welcome and not wanted right now, particularly in the coming weeks.”Related topicsBoris JohnsonSteve AikenSimon CoveneyUlster Unionist PartyMore On Boris Johnson PremiumMalachi O#DohertyOpinionTime the middle ground made a stand for what they want PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionChange is in the air... and it could have lasting ramications as poll shows Sinn Fein could take First Minister’s position PremiumMost people in Northern Ireland believe Boris Johnson should resign over partygate PremiumThe Weekly Political Spin: From delayed apologies and Poots# preference for steak, to Thatcher and Cromwell PremiumLindy McDowellOpinionBy making fun of Partygate, we’re ignoring the much bigger storyMost ReadFionntan McGarvey ‘lit up the sky with his smile’, funeral of tragic GAA player toldEdwin Poots says we is ‘disgusted’ over ‘joke’ as UUP leader Doug Beattie apologises in AssemblyBelfast man Jon O’Hara one of two Ravenhill Road crash victims - mancharged with causing death by dangerous drivingLuxury million-pound Co Down home with breath-taking views of Belfast LoughOur ‘simple’ le – Jamie Dornan’s we Amelia Warner on keeping things normalTop VideosPlayVideo: Surfer rescues two people after kayak overturns in PortrushPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo - Three police cars damaged as hijacked car collides with church wall in BelfastLatest WorldOfficials:  Australians on ship delivering aid to Tonga have Covid-Deadly stampede overshadows Cameroon’s African Cup progressUS puts , troops on heightened alert amid Russia tensionNew space telescope reaches final stop one million miles outStudent kills one and wounds three in shooting at German universityLatest#Restructuring among firms likely in #Offshore wind plans wins share of fundingPre-tax profits up % to £.m for oil and gas firm DCC EnergyEntrepreneur Patrick McAliskey: ‘I want to give Lurgan an industry’Football rumours: Newcastle may break club transfer record for Yves Bissouma,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is understandable that there are concerns around receiving the vaccine.

pound,.Confirmation that work is to start soon on the centre upgrade has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who has also thanked Strangford MP Jim Shannon and her council colleague Billy Walker for their support in driving the renovation programme forward.She revealed that she had been contacted by a number of residents about the slow progress of the scheme and is pleased that everything is now on track.In addition to the planned work at the community centre, consideration is also being given to investing around pound, to finance internal alterations of the local authority-owned Market House in the town centre.And the Recorder understands that consideration is being given to providing an ultra-modern G sports pitch at the Langley Road playing fields with the adjoining sports pavilion also in line for a major upgradeA number of politicians have been lobbying for the local authority to address what they described as the organisationrsquos ldquounder investment in Ballynahinch and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities is a critical component of its future investment plans.Council officials had previously been asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.However, they have opted to commit pound, on a major upgrade of the existing complex which will include a reconfiguration of the internal floorspace in a bid to increase the buildingrsquos usage.Politicians say they are keen to work in partnership with council officials and the Ballynahinch Community Collective to improve sports and community provision in the town to meet the needs of a wide range of people.Elected representatives say Ballynahinch needs to be at the heart of planned investment in future leisure provision across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Politicians are keen to ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out when it comes to leisure provision investment, given the money that has already spent in other towns across the council area.They believe that the good working relationship that exists between elected representatives across the Rowallane area can ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out on future funding opportunitiesand that the needs of the townrsquos community are met, particularly when it comes to modern leisure, sports and community provision.Politicians want Ballynahinch to be included in any future strategy when it comes to leisure activities and provision, warning that the town cannot afford be left behind.They say the current community centre requires a much-needed upgrade with the current proposal a major step in the right direction.Elected representatives say that given the local council spend on major schemes in other parts of the district, the ratepayers of Ballynahinch deserve nothing less than an upgrade community

We have been there and we know what to expect, but we donrsquot know much about St Finbarrrsquos as we have never played them.The Kilcoo star added: ldquoWe will just sit down and focus on them and take it from there.There will perhaps be an unusual link in familiarity within the St Finbarrrsquos ranks, as former Down county star Conor McCrickard is part of their starting .The  year-old made the switch down south last year as part of a biomedical engineering degree at Ulster University and enjoyed an incredible debut season with The Barrrsquos, having contributed to their Cork Senior Football Championship win against Clonakilty and most recently, their Munster title victory over Austin Stacks.The Liatroim Fontenoys clubman will hold valuable know-how over his neighbouring club Kilcoo, and may use this unlikely  to give newly reinstated Down boss James McCartan a selection headache for the future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19_January2022_Burns.jpg","title":"Radio show to talk about Burns Night  ","story":"BURNS Night takes centre stage on the Chris Scott Show on FM Down Community Radio tonight from pm.Join Chris in conversation with Brian Cassidy, president of the Belfast Burns Association.Brian talks to Chris about some aspects of the le of Robert Burns, the world famous Scottish poet and lyricist.Brian also talks about the Belfast Burns Association and what happens at a Burns Night, which will celebrated world-wide on January , Burnsrsquo birthday.Chris will be playing some of the bardrsquos compositions throughout the show.The programme is repeated on Sunday, from -pm If you are outside the FM signal area you can tune in online at https:onlineradiobox uk downcommunity You can also go to the Google Play Store and App Store and download the SERC Community Radio app..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19_January2022_Saintfield.jpg","title":"Saintfield community park could be reality as US benefactor visits  ","story":"AMBITIOUS plans for a new heritage community park in Saintfield could finally come to fruition in the spring of , it has been revealed.Saintfield Development Association is spearheading the drive for the new facility on land known locally as the Windmill Field, adjacent to the new community centre at the Belfast Road.A bid for funding to help pave the way for the new park, which is also being financially supported by American benefactor David Moffett whose ancestors emigrated to the USA from nearby Leggygowan, has been submitted to the National Lottery Heritage Fund.It is hoped that a decision on the funding application will be made by March.The application includes a proposal to stabilise the three remaining stone buildings at the site of the proposed park and make them safe for future generations to visit and learn about the industrial heritage of two windmills, two watermills and railway.In the latest edition of Saintfield News, the association described progress with the planning application for the proposed community park as ldquoslow, but steady.The application is seeking permission for a change of use from agricultural to amenity use for the public. All statutory consultees bar one have now given the proposal their approval, with discussions with the final consultee in progress.Association officials say the planning application covers only the paths, pond, fencing and information  associated with the field close to the community centre.ldquoMany hours have been put in completing the application to the Heritage Fund which was submitted at the end of November with a decision due in March, Saintfield News confirms, explaining thatthe bid is successful, it will be for the development phase of the project.ldquoThis will probably take one year and will include detailed measurements of the scheduled monument buildings, work plans, costings for stabilising these and obtaining scheduled monument consent and planning approval for these works.ldquoAt the end of this development phase a further application to the Heritage Fund would be made for the delivery phase of the project. ldquoThe association says thatthis was successful and all went well, the park and windmill would be opened to the public in the spring of .However,the Heritage Fund application is unsuccessful, the association will proceed with the proposal, but the work would exclude the scheduled monument area.ldquoThis would be fenced off as unsafe and left as is, reports Saintfield News. ldquoCompetition for Heritage Fund grants is very competitive and many other projects in Northern Ireland will be applying. It will be a great achievementwe are successful.ldquoThis is probably the only source of funding that can preserve the windmill and the other two buildings of the scheduled monument for future generations. Without this funding, the buildings will continue their slow decline and will eventually collapse.Meanwhile, the man who is supporting the community park proposal visited Saintfield recently.Mr Moffett has already made a substantial donation to the association to enable it to purchase the Windmill Field.During his visit, Mr Moffett had an opportunity to walk around the field and visualise how the proposed community park would surround the ancient windmill and caretakerrsquos home that is part of Saintfieldrsquos history. He also met a number of residents at the community centre before visiting Rowallane Garden for a guided tour.Mr Moffett concluded the first day of his visit with a visit to the Belfast Road community centre to view the new facility and was impressed at the potential of fitting out the remaining empty buildings which would include a heritage area to complement the planned windmill park.Mr Moffett, who also played a round of golf at Royal County Down and visited the Mournes, said the beauty of Co Down, with its unique visitor sites and the central location of Saintfield, reinforced in his mind the importance of the windmill park project and the heritage centre.The third and final day of his visit was spent at a local shop exploring the location of his familyrsquos th century farm in Leggygowan.Mr Moffett said: ldquoExploring my family history was a wonderful way to end my visit to Saintfield. I look forward to ing soon and continuing to work on our shared interest in completing the windmill park project and heritage centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19January2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Speed sign reinstated in Saintfield in bid to halt speeding drivers  ","story":"WORK has started to reinstate an electronic speed indicator sign at the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield.The sign mdash one of a number erected across the district by the arearsquos Policing and Community Partnership mdash was removed last year after concerns were expressed about its original location at the busy road.Designed to put the brakes on speeders, the signs have proved effective in a number of locations with plans to install more of them over the coming months.The reinstatement of the Saintfield sign has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who said that it will make drivers more aware of their speed at this busy road.A decision to relocate the Saintfield sign was agreed by a sub-committee of the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership.Cllr Owen said she was delighted that the speed sign was being erected as it will remind drivers of their speed as they approach the built-up town centre area.Cllr Owen also thanked residents who helped her lobby for the reinstatement of the speed indicator sign following its removal.The Ballynahinch Road is one of the districtrsquos speeding hot spots with a number of high speeds recorded by the previous speed indicator sign located in a mph zone. It was revealed last May that one driver was clocked travelling at an incredible mph in the mph zone in Saintfield at am.Figures released by the PCSP over the past year have revealed that speeding in built-up areas across the district continues to be a major problem.In addition to the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield, other speeding hot spots include the Strangford Road in Downpatrick and South Promenade in Newcastle.The Dundrum Road in Clough is a new entry on the list following the installation of an electronic speeding device on the approach to the village, while the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass is another new entry on the speeding hot-spot list.The highest speed recorded in the mph zone in Clough was mph at am, with the highest speed at the Strangford Road mdash where a mph limit is in place mdash was mph. This offence was detected around am.Since the speeds recorded by the electronic devices have been made public, politicians have expressed their shock at the behaviour of those who continue to break the law and have appealed to them to slow down.Erected as part of a major offensive on speeding drivers at a number of well known speeding hot spots, the speed indicator devices are being hailed a success as speeds in most areas where they are located are reducing.However, concern remains about the behaviour of some drivers continuing to show a blatant disregard for mph and mph speed limits in place.Recent figures published by the PCSP revealed that the highest number of speeders in Castlewellan and Killyleagh were detected around am and pm respectively, with those who hit high speeds in Ardglass detected at pm.While Clough recorded the highest speed, a detailed examination of the figures reveals that five drivers went through the mph in the village at mph, with % of all drivers travelling in excess of the speed limit.In Downpatrick,  drivers were detected at over mph in the mph zone, with one driver clocked at mph in the mph zone at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan. The highest speed recorded at the mph zone at the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass was mph.Policing and Community Safety Partnership officials say that figures recorded across the districtrsquos speed indicator signs for the most recent three-month period shows an overall speed reduction of around six percent.The number of drivers clocked at over mph across the  speed indicator signs spread across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area was almost , while the average number of speeding violations over mph was %.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLast year because we were in deep lockdown it never happened and because of the current Covid rules it had to be postponed again, which is probably why only three walkers came out to meet him at the Knap car terrace in perfect walking weather, on a bright and crisp morning to join in a -mile replacement walk.On the hillside just above them are the neat foundations of a Roman Building which contained  rooms all grouped around a courtyard with the building being dated to the late rd century AD by the Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust. It seems a natural harbour was to be found to the east of this area and one theory is that this was a guesthouse connected with naval activity at the harbour as no evidence of a water supply or baths common in villa’s could be found. In the early ’s the trust carried out excavations on site and pieces of Roman pottery and tiles were found and a public viewing  now overlooks the site.They soon warmed up due to a short but stf climb onto the clftop and followed a narrow path through woodland to descend the Golden Stairs into Porthkerry Country Park, where the frost covered board walk led them towards the ft Porthkerry Viaduct. Deviating off the cycle path at Robin’s Walk brought them into muddy fields beside the Whitelands Brook for the climb up to join the A opposite Welford and along the verge to cross a stile leading into fields behind Blackton Farm.A well-worn farm track led to the road for the journey to Penmark Village where they entered the churchyard of St Mary’s for their mid-morning refreshments, utilising the steps on the preaching cross as seating whilst enjoying the warm sunshine. The church dates to the th century being mentioned for the first time in  and a few centuries later the tower was added, but most of its medieval traits were lost when it was renovated during the Victorian era..removeThey continued and joined part of the long distance Valeways Millennium Heritage Trail, through fields on the boundary of Cardf Airport making towards Fonmon with its lovely duck pond and stunning weeping willow tree which cascades over the water. Then climbing steps into a small wood leading to muddy fields near Home Farm they eventually exited onto Port Road following it southwards to East Aberthaw.Taking time out they paused at the Blue Anchor for a swt pint outside in the fresh air before following Well Road downhill. This road was previously known as Marshe Way, one would presume because the River Thaw flowed to reach the sea by this route until the Aberthaw Power Station was built and the river was re-routed.Tramping muddy paths below the main Vale railway line through the nature reserve which is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest, they headed through the reed beds beside the western end of the delightful lake, overseen by the ruined Aberthaw Limeworks built in , to arrive at the sea defence wall. Heading out onto the beach they found a suitable place for lunch sitting on a washed up tree trunk beside the dunes and overlooking the Bristol Channel and English coastline before continuing along the salt flats.The beautul refurbished clf steps on part of the Wales Coast Path brought them steeply uphill into Fontygary Leisure Park, which was eerily quiet due to the winter months and reaching Fontygary beach, they continued up steps following the coast path past the old disused limestone quarries to reach the southernmost tip of mainland Wales and Rhoose Point. Onward through Porthkerry Holiday Park and the Iron Age hillfort at the Bulwarks, to slither downhill through the woods back into Porthkerry for the steep climb back up the Golden Stairs in order to make their way along the clftop to Cold Knap, just as the sun was sinking in the western sky.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Evie Kwan represents the Vale.Dan Downton was elected as a partner member on behalf of the National Deaf Children’s Society. Seth Burke represents Ty Hafan.I want to wish Seth who has recently recovered from Covid well and I look forward to meeting with everyone over the next few months.In this year’s Local Government elections, which will be held in May,    year olds will be able to vote for their local councillors for the first time.It is so important that young people engage with politics and are given the opportunity to voice what is important to them and influence decisions which effect them. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Butyou want to wear a T-shirt that says ‘Where’s Peng Shuai ’, you can come on site, that’s fine.“There was a suspicion around the motivation of that inidual coming on site but we’ve since contacted that person and told her that she’s welcome to come on site, she’s welcome to wear a T-shirt, but not bring a banner, because you can’t bring banners on site..remove“It doesn’t have anything to do with a political or commercial statement. Our security people are trained to take a common sense approach, and I think that’s in the interest of everyone.”Fans wearing Peng Shuai T-shirts were filmed entering Melbourne Park on Tuesday.Having kept a very low profile in the aftermath of Novak Djokovic’s deportation, Tiley has been more visible in recent days.Tennis Australia came under fire for its role in pushing for exemptions for unvaccinated players to enter the country, but Tiley dismissed suggestions the fiasco had damaged the tournament’s reputation.Volunteers for the Democratic Alliance Party have entered the #AusOpen wearing “Where is Peng Shuai” t-shirts.Craig Tiley sensationally reversed his decision to confiscate them. pic QoUhgrUjK—SportJanuary , “No I absolutely don’t ,” he said. “I think the reputation of the tournament’s been defined by what you see today. We’ve had more people from around the world watch the Australian Open than ever before.“The feedback we’re getting from our customer satisfaction surveys on site has been the highest, even higher than . The feedback we’re getting from our broadcasters has also been the highest. Eurosport put out a note this morning that they’re getting their biggest numbers ever.“No one person is bigger than the event. I think we’re going to end up over the next five days firstly with a great event and potentially with a couple of new champions.”Another hot topic has been around the issue of Covid- testing for players, who, along with the rest of the workforce, are being trusted to use the daily antigen tests provided.Two players, Ugo Humbert and Alison Van Uytvanck, announced the tests they took to leave the country came back positive, and Alexander Zverev said last week that he believed positive cases were slipping through.Tiley said: “It’s really impossible to supervise , people every morning. We’re trusting the players are doing the right thing.“We know we’ve distributed thousands of antigen tests for the players, we’re getting feedback from a lot that they are continuing to do the right thing and we’re still getting some positives, so we know they are.“On our mandatory tests, we’ve been well below the community averages so the approach of mandatory wearing of masks and social distancing, as well as the testing programme, is hopefully going to help us get through this event with much lower positive case rates than the community.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Australian Open supporters  uwelcome u to wear Peng Shuai T-shirts article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

On Monday, January , the council’s cabinet signed off plans to consult the public on its plan to introduce the nursery places.Cllr Ben Gray, cabinet member for social care and health, said: “This school needs to be replaced — it’s clearly a building which is not fit for purpose. It’s really important that this moves forward and St Nicholas gets a primary school which is fit for purpose.”The new school would be built on the current site, just north of the main building. The main building would then be demolished, and the space used for car parking and spaces for parents and carers who drive to drop off their children, addressing existing congestion issues. The school would still be just a short walk away from the village’s church.According to a recent cabinet report, the current school buildings have “major defects”, with an estimated maintenance backlog of £,, adversely affecting teaching. The school has also faced issues with sinkholes and radon gas. Reception pupils have to walk to the nearby Old School building after morning assembly, along a road without pavement.Demand for local nursery places is growing, with new housing estates recently built in St Nicholas and Bonvilston, and permission for  more houses east of St Nicholas and  east of Bonvilston..removeBut the cabinet decided it would be too expensive to find an alternative site for building a replacement school twice the size of the current one, and instead chose to put forward the new plan for a school with  places and  nursery places. Refurbishing the current buildings was also seen as too tricky given the condition of the buildings and parking issues.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education, said: “The school wanted to stay where it is. It is a Church in Wales school and they felt that their connection to the church was very important. The buildings would be very dficult to refurbish — they’re not up to scratch and it would be very dficult to retrofit them and to fit in a nursery.”The council’s planning committee has not yet granted permission for the replacement school building. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We are now working with the dental sector to recover and reform services, and this £ million boost will help with that recovery.”Appointments for some routine dental treatments, such as dental check-ups, are limited at this time as dentists prioritise vulnerable patients and those with urgent dental needs. #HelpUsHelpYou pic dxbBeGUK— NHS Sheffield CCGJanuary , Shawn Charlwood, chair of the BDA’s general dental practice committee, said: “Any additional funding is needed recognition of the huge backlogs facing NHS dentistry.“After a decade of cuts a cash-starved service risks being offered money that can’t be spent. Hard-pressed practices are working against the clock and many will struggle to find capacity ahead of April for this investment to make a dference.“Until today not a penny of the Government’s multi-billion-pound catch-up programme had reached dentistry. This is progress but must be just the startwe are to rebuild a service millions depend on.”A number of reports from the patient watchdog Healthwatch England have pointed to serious problems to dentistry access throughout the pandemic.Healthwatch England found wide-ranging issues from people being asked to wait for three years for an appointment, others asked to conduct “DIY dentistry” while waiting for help and some felt they were being coerced into “going private”.Jacob Lant, head of policy at Healthwatch England, said: “This is a vital injection of money and will help tackle the spiralling crisis in dental access and affordability.“We are particularly pleased to see NHS England prioritising appointments for vulnerable people, including children, with many missing school and suffering in pain as a result of dental problems that were entirely preventable through routine care.“There still remains deeper and more systemic challenges in the dental sector that have been laid bare over the last two years, but we need to build from this and start to get the nation’s oral health back on track after this dreadful pandemic.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Night time and weekend appointments as dentists tackle backlog article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We want to ensure that we have the skills and structure to ensure our programmes are reaching their full potential and can contribute to making Northern Ireland more peaceful.” Since the programme opened in January , the Dormant Accounts Fund for Northern Ireland has awarded £,, to  organisations including arts, sports, charities and community-based organisations with the money being used to help build long-term sustainability. Paul Sweeney, The National Lottery Community Fund’s NI Chair, said: “The Dormant Accounts Fund NI has been open for applications for one year now, and we continue to be impressed by the range of organisations applying for funding, looking beyond their day-to-day operational role to plan their long-term future and sustainability.” PeacePlayers NI Coaches groupNorthern IrelandMid  East AntrimNational Lottery Community Fund  \"       \"  ]]Most Popular‘Substantial’ sum of money found in Portadown...NewsChildren break in to Co Armagh school, play with toys and le...News‘Aggressive’ rogue trader selling knives in Portadown hunted...NewsUpgrade programme getting underway at two parks in Larne...NewsDefendant ‘believed he might be safe to drive’, court is tol...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":null,"title":"pomeroy forest site gets ps spruce up ","story":"‘Aggressive’ rogue trader selling knives in Portadown hunted by PSNI   ‘Substantial’ sum of money found in PortadownNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPeoplePomeroy Forest site gets £, spruce upMajor improvement works have recently got underway at the courtyard area and car park at Pomeroy Forest.By The NewsroomMonday, th January , : am  \"       \"  The scheme is costing £, started earlier this month and are funded under DAERA’s Rural Development Programme.The signicant funding will see the development of the old courtyard area in Pomeroy Forest to include an imaginative feature space, rejuvenation of the old building aesthetically, creation of an outdoor activity event space and communal area with picnic facilities and additional onsite car parking.The works will also see the adjacent car park area upgraded, including the demolition of the existing out building, an improved drainage system, re-surfacing works, line markings, as well as tactile paving and lighting.Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Councillor Paul McLean, has commended the works. “To see this signicant project get underway is extremely pleasing.
