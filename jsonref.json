The brain registers the majority of information about flavour via millions of olfactory (smell) cells, so that is why the cider must be swirled in the glass to release aromas. A wine glass is best for doing this, but don’t fill it to the brim as the cider needs space to breathe so the aromas develop. Gently swirl the cider a couple of times and sniff it. Then take a sip and let the cider cover the tongue. More aromas will be released and travel to the nasal cavity through the back of the throat. Think about what you smell and taste, the cider’s body, the texture, the overall drinking experience. Then repeat. That’s how to taste cider! All-occasion quaffing: Thatchers Gold Thatchers’ flagship cider, Gold, is a blend of several apple varieties. Eating apples bestow Thatchers Gold fruitiness and a satisfying “bite”, while cider apples including two of the undisputed superstars – dabinett and Harry Masters Jersey – give body and depth to the flavour. Thatchers Gold is an eminently quaffable cider for all occasions with ripe and juicy green apple aromas and flavours bursting from the glass, a sherbet-like mouthfeel with gentle carbonation, and a refreshing tang. If you are a wine drinker looking for a cider to suit your palate then Thatchers Gold will appeal to fans of viognier. Pair with grilled sea bass, or satay vegetables if you’re veggie. Cheshire cheese is a great match too its slight saltiness will contract the cider’s underlying sweetness. Crisp and cloudy: Thatchers HazeThatchers Haze brims with fruitiness from a blend of fruit bowl favourites: discovery, falstaff, gala and jonagold. Cider made from eating apples tends to be light-bodied and crisp, and Thatchers Haze is no exception. A solid entry-level blend for those wishing to explore cider more deeply on the nose and palate it has green apples, pears, banana, a hint of lemon, an effervescent mouthfeel, and a sweet tangy finish. The cider’s distinct natural cloudiness is thanks to jonagold apple juice adding a sweetness that makes Thatchers Haze match especially well with spicy foods, such as falafel burgers, or spicy pork stir-fry. For wine drinkers, if you imagine riesling with that easy-drinking fruitiness and refreshing acidity, then Thatchers Haze will appeal to the same palate. The solo star: Thatchers KatyWhile most ciders are made from blending different apple varieties, Thatchers Katy is a single-variety cider. Made from the popular eating apple of the same name, it is fresh and fruity with a subtle sweetness, a refreshing acidity, tingling carbonation and crisp, tangy finish. Thatchers ferments Katy apples with a type of yeast that sparkling wine producers use, enhancing the flavour. However, there’s evidence to suggest it was 17th-century West Country cider makers who first experimented with secondary fermentation to add a natural sparkle to the drink, some time before champagne was invented – so you could say that cider was the original sparkling tipple. Take the flute challenge – pour a glass of Thatchers Katy and a glass of prosecco and blind taste them – which is the wine and which is the premium cider? Thatchers Katy is perfect as an aperitif and for dining. Food-wise, go for lighter textured food with delicate flavours, such as grilled cod and asparagus risotto. For a cheese match, the savoury salty flavours of parmesan are a contrast to the fruity sweetness of Thatchers Katy. Sweet explosion: Thatchers RoséWaves of strawberry, raspberry and cherry flavours refresh the mouth. Thatchers Rosé cider is made exclusively from those dessert apple favourites cripps pink, gala and fuji. Sweet fruitiness pops and fizzes across your tongue, before the mouth is filled with a zingy texture. It’s a light and easy-drinking cider that suits being well chilled. Drink it for refreshment at a picnic, or treat it as a dessert cider to be enjoyed with Eton mess or summer pudding. Full-bodied and spiced: Thatchers Rascal Imagine if apple pie came in a glass. Rascal is the cider equivalent, with a scrumptious array of flavours including red apples, pears, demerara sugar and spice. Created with a blend of cider apple stalwarts – redstreak, dabinett and tremlett’s bitter – this bold cider contains tannins that give the cider a fuller mouthfeel than the ciders made with eating or dessert apples. Tannins attract fats and proteins, cut through the texture of dense and fatty food and refresh the mouth. So pair with hearty meals such as a Sunday roast or mac and cheese, followed by apple crumble and custard. Equally, this is an excellent sitting-in-your-favourite-pub-and-chatting with your friends type of cider.

I didn’t think about the terroir of grape-growing, the nose of whisky or what wine to pair with raw tilapia. On sunny days, I just thought about the most enjoyable way to quench my thirst. Now, the clank of a metal bottle opener and the hiss of a cold Thatchers Cider opening is enough to bring me back to the Meadows in Edinburgh, for a post-lecture picnic with friends. Stretched out on the grass as the rays warm my skin, the air is filled with the smoky smell of barbecue. Summer walks have been made all the sweeter with a sip of cider at the end. Arriving at a sweep of beach, blanket at the ready, or settling at the end of a pier as the sun sets. The cool fizz of cider tickling down my throat while the sky streaks violet and hazy pink is an unbeatable feeling. On an emotional level, clinking bottles with a friend at the end of the day is the perfect reward. On a practical level, a couple of bottles of ice-cold Thatchers in your rucksack on the way to the sea cools your back – ideal. Cider is the taste of a barbecue with my family – the only way we were allowed to see each other in summer 2020. My dad cooked venison burgers for the first time, an attempt to impress me, the “food and drink writer”, making jokes about not wanting a bad review. Despite the burger buns being a bit frozen in the middle, I gave it 1010. The sun was shining, family was gathered, the cider was flowing and for a brief second it felt like normality again. The epitome of the “better times” we’re all looking forward to. I can’t always suppress the drinks writer in me and did have to note that the iron-y tang of venison burgers goes particularly well with the light sweetness of Thatchers Katy. On the slopes of the Mendip Hills, Thatchers grows 458 different varieties of apple in perfect conditions – more than 25 varieties of them are used for ciders. The autumnal rain, summer sun and lack of winter frost combine to create juicy, flavour-filled apples. They have a cider for every taste bud: sharp and cloudy, sweet and pink. As a drinks writer, I’ve sampled more ciders than I care to remember. Thatchers Katy is the choice for sunny days and balmy nights. While Thatchers’ other ciders are made from a combination of different types of apple, Thatchers Katy is made from just one type. Red as a fairytale apple and sweet as strawberries, Katy apples are the pride of the crop and first to be run through the mill. It’s what you want to be drinking to get that real thirst-quenching moment, with only a hint of sweetness that doesn’t overpower. It sits between sweet and dry, with a crisp finish, so it’s incredibly drinkable. Being an apple-based drink, it goes best with anything pork. But its lightness also carries well with salads and summer food. Think charcuterie boards laden with spicy salami, salty prosciutto, and garlicky mortadella. The slight sweetness to Thatchers Katy cuts through the saltiness of prosciutto beautifully. Hand-held picnic food – scotch eggs, sausage rolls, and pork pies – tends to be savoury-heavy, so goes down a treat with a sweet cider, paired best with a sunset view, of course. But it also mixes well with fruity dishes – a salad sprinkled with glistening pomegranate seeds and topped with ripe avocado. The delicate fizz works particularly well with the creamy squish of avocado. Meat and salad, barbecues and picnic food it’s as though Thatchers Katy was designed for summer. So, it’s no wonder cider is the British summer drink of choice it pairs naturally with grilled meat and fruity salads, it’s easy to drink, and that hit of sweet apple sings of good times. For me, cider evokes memories of barbecues with friends and family, sunsets over the sea and picnics in the park, and Thatchers Katy is my cider of choice this summer, for its strawberry sweetness and crisp finish. If you need me, I’ll be sipping a cold cider in the park, or on my way to the shore, two bottles clinking away and cooling my back. To better times.

There have been an additional 70 deaths in France, taking the country’s total to 108,596, the eighth-highest in the world. The decision was widely perceived outside the country as a turning point in Turkey’s relationship with the west. In retrospect, the crowds in Sultanahmet Square represented another cultural shift – a change in how Turkey’s government dealt with the coronavirus pandemic after months of closed borders, and weekend and evening curfews. The success rate has been used as an argument that the country is ready for the crucial summer tourism season. Yet Turkey still has the fifth-highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world and doctors said the officially reported drop in new cases is statistically impossible, showing instead a huge reduction in testing.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures.

Aerial footage shows bright rivers of flowing lava from the volcano in eastern  Democratic Republic of Congo.Residents check the damages caused by lava from the overnight eruption of Mount Nyiragongo, seen in background, in Buhene, on the outskirts of Goma. Photograph: Justin KabumbaAP Photo A smoking trail of lava from a volcanic eruption covered hundreds of houses in eastern Congo on Sunday, leaving residents to pick gingerly through the wreckage for belongings and loved ones, though the flow halted just short of the city of Goma.Goma was thrown into panic on Saturday evening as Mount Nyiragongo, one of the world’s most active and dangerous volcanoes, erupted, turning the night sky an eerie red and sending a wall of orange lava downhill towards the lakeside city of about two million people.It was not immediately clear how many people had died, or how widespread the material damage was.Haunted by memories of an eruption in 2002 that killed 250 people and left 120,000 homeless, residents fled on foot with their belongings, some towards the nearby border with Rwanda.The International Federation of Red Cross said that between 3,000 and 5,000 fled into Rwanda on Saturday, many of them peasants and farmers with livestock. Local authorities said five people died in a traffic accident in the rush to leave.Saturday’s eruption was caused when fractures opened in the volcano’s side, causing lava flows in various directions.As the sun rose on Sunday a smouldering black gash about half a mile wide could be seen on the outskirts of Goma, where the lava had cooled to rubble. At some points it was three storeys high, engulfing even large buildings and sending smoke into the grey morning sky.Residents in the Buhene district sorted through the mangled white remains of tin roofs or lifted rocks – tiny inidual efforts in what will likely be a months-long campaign to restore the zone. Elsewhere, groups of people posed for photos on the steaming lava.‘I curse this day’Some said they lost family members. Ernestine Kabul (68) said she tried to carry her sick husband from their house as the lava approached, but he was too unwell to leave.“I said to myself, I can’t go alone, we’ve been married for the best and for the worst,” said Ms Kabul. “I went back to at least try to get him out but couldn’t. I ran away and he got burned inside. I don’t know what to do. I curse this day.”The flow towards Goma stopped a few hundred metres from the city limits. The nearby airport was untouched. A separate lava flow that headed east over unpopulated terrain towards Rwanda also appeared to have stopped.“Local authorities who have been monitoring the eruption overnight report that the lava flow has lost intensity,” government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said on Twitter on Sunday.Still, authorities warned that the danger was not over and that seismic activity in the area could cause further lava flows.Lava crossed a main road out of Goma overnight, cutting it off from cities to the north. Traffic was in gridlock in most places as people tried to leave or return to assess the damage to their homes.Experts were worried that the volcanic activity observed in the past five years at Nyiragongo mirrors that in the years preceding eruptions in 1977 and 2002.Volcanologists at the OVG, which monitors Nyiragongo, have struggled to make basic checks on a regular basis since the World Bank cut funding amid embezzlement allegations, though experts said that the timing of this eruption was impossible to predict.“We’ve been extremely lucky that it was very brief,” said Dario Tedesco, a volcanologist based in Goma. “From the little information we have, it was just the lava within the crater that came out, there was no additional lava from below.” – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Jeremy Paxman reveals first sign of Parkinson\u0026#39s was when computer screen \u0026#39started filling up with gibberish\u0026#39Comment: We have nothing to fear from a trade deal with AustraliaHollywood elite fight plans for homeless cabins in upmarket beach areas  Exclusive: Ethiopians suffer horrific burns in suspected white phosphorus attacks Coronavirus latest news: France hints at tougher restrictions on UK travellers amid variant fearsFrance considers stricter controls for UK travellers to combat spread of Indian Covid variantSturgeon putting UK security at risk by encouraging attempts to block immigration raids, Patel claimsIsraeli officials \u0026#39regret\u0026#39 bombing Gaza AP bureau as post-ceasefire clean up beginsRyanair flight carrying exiled Belarusian journalist forced to land in MinskSNP health secretary admits there is scope to speed up rollout of vaccines in ScotlandThirteen people dead and two children injured as cable car crashes in ItalyRussia and China will \u0026#39behave responsibly\u0026#39, First Sea Lord says, as Carrier Strike Group sets sailPriti Patel refuses to say she trusts the BBC and warns its ‘reputation has been compromised’Comment: Dominic Cummings\u0026#39s \u0026#39bombshell\u0026#39 testimony will likely prove a damp squibThe numbers are looking good for June 21 reopening, say health chiefs Video: Virgin Galactic launches flight to edge of atmosphere ahead of plans to take tourists next yearComment: The truth about British railways is that they weren\u0026#39t privatised enough Comment: Remainer fussbudgets want to steal our European sunQueen relishes return to full-time dutiesItalian hilltop town in revolt after Swiss aristocrat\u0026#39s family demands ancient tax rightsBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ufo uap aliens report sightings us government encounters barack","story":"She has also had one of the most famous close encounters with a UFO, or Unidentified Flying Object.In separate planes, Lt Cdr Dietrich and Commander David Fravor were dispatched to investigate.What they saw on that day has never been adequately explained – until now.Cmdr Fravor aggressively engaged one of the oblong objects, which he estimated to be 40ft in length, while Lt Cdr Dietrich adopted “high cover” above.Ship radar picked it up seconds later, 60 miles away. A third FA-18 then caught it on an infrared camera: it looked like a giant white Tic Tac.Lt Cdr Dietrich decided to go public with her story now – three years after Cdr Fravor – to reduce the “stigma” associated with UFO reports and, she says, to encourage other pilots to come forward without feeling “embarrassed or ashamed”.Her testimony coincides with a growing acceptance among defence officials around the world that there may indeed be something “out there” – and that it might pose a genuine global security threat.After decades of doing everything possible to keep reported sightings secret, there has been a sea change in how the Pentagon regards such sightings.For starters, it no longer refers to them as UFOs – with their connotations of little green men – but to UAPs, or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena. Next month, Congress is to be given an unclassified report on evidence collected by the Pentagon’s UAP Task Force, the Office of Naval Intelligence and the FBI.Ufologists - people who investigate UFOs - across the globe are hailing it as an unprecedented watershed moment in their long quest to uncover what the US government really knows – and they have former president Donald Trump to thank for it.“We’re absolutely in new territory here,” says Nick Pope, who investigated UFO sightings while working as a British civil servant for the Ministry of Defence in the 1990s.“What’s really elevated this is the sheer number, and position, of people now speaking out, saying we’re dealing with something that must be taken seriously, he added.“When top guns, who don’t impress easily, get excited about the capability of these objects, their speed, manoeuvrability, trans-medium travel in water and air… that gets my attention.The pilot testimony is important, but there is so much more: radar data, infrared, measurement and signature intelligence… and we’ll get to see some of it.”John Ratcliffe, director of National Intelligence under President Trump, raised anticipation when he hinted recently that there was “a lot” more information than the public currently knows.He said he had seen satellite imagery of objects “frankly engaging in actions that are difficult to explain”, and incidents of them breaking the sound barrier with no sonic boom.The following month, a farmer found wreckage on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. In a press release, the US military called it a “flying disc”, but later said it was part of a weather balloon.By the 1950s, the US Air Force was being inundated with UFO reports from the public. One of the most notorious was the so-called “Invasion of Washington” in 1952, when numerous sightings were made over the capital in a two-week period.It was the Cold War, and the CIA, fearing mass hysteria could play into the hands of the Soviet Union, worked to debunk sightings and infiltrate UFO-hunting groups.“Further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot be justified,” it said.For decades afterwards, anyone who reported seeing something strange in the sky was considered a crackpot – even leading lights in the US military.However, there remained a few highly influential figures who believed a mystery was there to be solved. The most powerful among them was Senator Harry Reid, the Democrat leader in the US Senate from 2005 to 2017.In 2007, Mr Reid managed to push through Congress, clandestinely, $22 million in “black ops” funding for a new department. It was innocuously named the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP).From a fifth-floor office deep inside the Pentagon, a real-life X-Files team studied hundreds of reported UFO sightings – including the USS Nimitz “Tic Tac” incident from 2004.The department was led by Luis Elizondo, a career intelligence official who later resigned because he felt his findings were not being taken seriously enough.Shortly after his departure in late 2017, Mr Elizondo told the  how his team established geographical “hot spots” for sightings, sometimes near nuclear facilities, and common ways in which UFOs moved.“We began to see trends and similarities in incidents – very distinct observables. Extreme manoeuvrability, hypersonic velocity without a sonic boom, speeds of 8,000mph. A lot of this was supported by radar signal data, gun camera footage from aircraft, multiple witnesses.”He said he came to a “realisation that these are probably not any type of aircraft in any national inventory. I think it’s pretty clear it’s not us. So one has to ask the question where they’re from.”He also added: “There was never any display of hostility.”A key moment in the UFO debate – and whether it should be taken seriously – came in 2017 when the New York Times published the infrared video of the “Tic Tac” sighting. Ufologists felt vindicated, not least because it proved the Pentagon had seen fit to investigate the incident.Today, thanks to lockdown – which provided a dramatic reduction in light pollution coupled with an army of people with empty evenings on their hands – supposed UFO sightings have proliferated around the globe.In the UK alone, reports of suspected alien spacecraft doubled last year.And once-secret intelligence just keeps coming. Last month, footage of bizarre images of flashing pyramid-shaped UFOs was posted online, which the Pentagon confirmed was taken in 2019, by a US Navy ship off California.Another leaked video, taken from a fighter jet in 2015, showed a small object moving at tremendously high speed just above the water off Virginia on the US east coast. Pilots could be heard yelling: “Oh my gosh, dude” and “Wow! What is that, man? Look at that flying!”In another incident, pilots reported seeing an object that looked like a cube inside a sphere flying between their aircraft, which were barely 100ft apart.Many of these incidents are expected to be further detailed in next month’s report. But even though it will be “unclassified”, it\u0027s still unclear exactly how much will come out.“I don’t expect it’ll plunge into extraterrestrial visitation. If there is anything really juicy, it will probably be in the classified annex.

Earlier research also shows AstraZeneca takes longer to reach optimum effectiveness.Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, lead author of the PHE research team, said the “key message” was that two doses were “highly effective” against the Indian variant and would offer “higher protection” against severe illness and hospitalisation.Professor Susan Hopkins, PHE’s Covid-19 strategic response director, said the “trend” was “quite clear” and was heading in the “right direction”.Responding to the data, Sir Iain told The : “It is time for us to stop fearing all day and every day. We have to get on with our lives.“It is time the scientists were put back in their laboratories again and told ‘leave the Government to us’.“It is time for the British people to get back to work and to feel safe. And they won’t feel safe if every day some scientist comes up on the television to say, ‘Oh My God, we don’t know enough about this, we should stay locked down’.”Mark Harper MP, chairman of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group of more than 60 Tory MPs, added: “This new data, which confirms our vaccines are very effective against the B.1.617.2 variant first identified in India, means that the Government’s roadmap should proceed as planned and all domestic restrictions should end in June.“I hope the Prime Minister will now be able to say more about this by the end of this month as he had originally planned. Early confirmation that 21 June will see the end of social distancing would be especially welcome for the hospitality industry, which can’t survive unaided if social distancing were to continue.“Effective vaccines break the link between cases and serious disease, hospitalisation and death. They enable us to get back to living like normal again.”Government sources said on Saturday night that any decision on June 21 was dependent on hospitalisation data due this week, to see if new infections were causing serious illness. However, the researchers were reassured because so far there had been no signs of “increased severity in hospitalisations”.Shortly before the research was released, Mr Cummings launched a fresh series of tweets claiming the Government’s initial plan had been to try to secure herd immunity, before it was replaced by lockdowns as the death toll soared.He also claimed the failure to introduce mass testing by September last year had cost thousands more lives, and was responsible for a second lockdown.The PHE report also highlighted how the new Indian strain was more prevalent among people “with a history of foreign travel”.It notes how the Indian variant was “rapidly circulating”, with “areas of concern” including Bolton, Blackburn, Bedford and Hounslow in north-west London.Surge testing was being conducted in parts of west London on Saturday in response to the emergence of the Indian variant. People living and working in specific areas of Harrow, Ealing, Hillingdon and Brent will be advised to take a PCR test even if they do not have symptoms. Those who test positive for the variant are told to self-isolate and their contacts are traced.The PHE study took place between April 5, when the Indian variant emerged, to May 16. Some 12,675 genome-sequenced cases were included in the analysis, but only 1,054 were of the Indian variant.PHE found there were at least 2,889 cases of the Indian variant discovered this year. Of those, 104 cases resulted in a visit to a hospital emergency department, 31 required an overnight hospital admission and six resulted in death.The most common strain in England remains the Kent variant, with 132,082 cases recorded so far. Some 1,569 people have died with that strain.Throughout the UK, 71 per cent of adults have had their first vaccine, with 41 per cent – or 21 million people – protected with their second jab. The vaccine programme is estimated to have saved 13,000 lives and prevented 39,100 people from being hospitalised.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dr congo volcanogoma residents evacuate asmount nyiragongo erupts","story":"Thousands of people in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo have been told to evacuate their homes to escape lava from a volcanic eruption.As the red glow of Mount Nyiragongo tinged the night sky above the lakeside city of about 2 million, thousands of Goma residents carrying mattresses and other belongings fled the city on foot - many toward the frontier with Rwanda.Nyiragongo\u0027s last eruption in 2002 killed 250 people and left 120,000 homeless. It is one of the world\u0027s most active volcanoes and is considered among the most dangerous.Rwanda\u0027s Ministry in Charge of Emergency Management said more than 3,500 Congolese have crossed the border. Rwandan state media said they would be lodged in schools and places of worship.New fractures were opening in the volcano, letting lava flow south toward the city after initially flowing east toward Rwanda, said Dario Tedesco, a volcanologist based in Goma.Now Goma is the target, Tedesco told Reuters. It\u0027s similar to 2002. I think that the lava is going towards the city centre.It might stop before or go on. It\u0027s difficult to forecast, he said.Emmanuel De Merode, head of Virunga National Park, asked park employees in parts of Goma to evacuate, according to Reuters.He said lava had reached the international airport on the eastern edge of the city but that it was not likely to reach other parts of Goma.Celestin Kasereka, head of scientific research at the Goma Volcano Observatory (OVG), told reporters he did not think the lava was flowing fast enough to reach Goma.A United Nations source said all UN aircraft had been evacuated to the city of Bukavu to the south and Entebbe in neighbouring Uganda. The power was also out across much of Goma.Prime Minister Jean-Michel Sama Lukonde convened an emergency meeting in the capital, Kinshasa, where the government activated an evacuation plan for Goma.We hope that the measures that have been taken this evening will allow the population to reach the points that were indicated to them in this plan, government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said in comments broadcast on national television.President Felix Tshisekedi will cut short a trip to Europe to return to Congo on Sunday, the presidency said on Twitter.On the streets of Goma, panic spread quickly.We are panicked because we have just seen the entire city covered by a light that is not electricity or lamps, said John Kilosho. We don\u0027t know what to do. We don\u0027t even know how to behave. There is no information.Others fled to the city centre from villages and neighbourhoods threatened by lava on the northern outskirts.We looked at the sky and saw the red colour of the volcano, said Richard Hazika Diouf from the Majengo neighbourhood. We have fled to seek shelter in town.Volcano watchers have been worried that the volcanic activity observed in the last five years at Nyiragongo mirrors that in the years preceding eruptions in 1977 and 2002.Volcanologists at the OVG, which monitors Nyiragongo, have struggled to make basic checks on a regular basis since the World Bank cut funding amid embezzlement allegations.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"france considers stricter controls uk travellers combat spread","story":"France may impose tougher restrictions on British travellers as part of an effort to curb the spread of the more contagious Covid-19 Indian variant.Jean Yves-Le Drian, the country’s foreign affairs minister,  told French radio station RTL on Sunday that the government would not rule out “slightly stricter” measures for visitors coming from the United Kingdom.“We worry about the Indian variant and we remain on high alert regarding that matter, in cooperation with British authorities,” Mr Le Drian said.While no official announcement has been made, Mr Le Drian said it may mean the UK would be classified as a medium-risk country, referring to the colour-coded traffic light system used to determine which quarantine measures and other restrictions travellers fall into.Mr Le Drian stopped short of saying the UK would be classified as a ‘red’ country, but suggested it could be considered ‘yellow.’The news comes just one day after Germany’s Health Ministry announced that the UK was an “area of variant concern.” Starting Sunday at midnight, only German citizens and residents travelling from the UK are allowed to enter the country.Others will be turned away unless they have an essential reason for travel.More than 3,850 cases of the Indian variant have been detected in the UK, with a 160 percent increase in new cases over the last seven days.A paper presented to the UK government earlier this month said the Indian variant could be up to 50 percent more transmissible than the original strain.“At this point in the vaccine rollout, there are still too few adults vaccinated to prevent a significant resurgence that ultimately could put unsustainable pressure on the NHS,” the paper said.Even with the potential increased risk of transmissibility, some health experts said travel restrictions would do little to prevent the spread of new variants.“Closing the border will have no effect whatsoever,” said Catherine Hill, an epidemiologist at Gustave Roussy Hospital in Paris.She said people who are determined to travel will find ways to circumvent restrictions, such as flying to nearby countries, then hopping on a train or bus.“It’s just meaningless. If travellers really want to go see their old parents or if they really want to meet a friend, they will find a way,” Hill said, adding that for now there was “no cause for serious alarm” regarding the Indian variant.Preliminary evidence suggests vaccines are still effective against the Indian variant.There are very few confirmed cases of the Indian variant in France so far, but health experts worry it is spreading.France’s public health agency recorded 38 new outbreaks in the last seven days, a 60 percent increase from the week before.Three of the outbreaks were from family clusters with no known link to India, meaning it is unclear if it was spread on French soil.For now, the French public health agency concluded, there was still “no evidence of significant community spread” in France.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russia china expected behave responsibly not respond recklessly","story":"Russia and China are expected to behave responsibly and not respond recklessly to Britain\u0027s aircraft carrier, the First Sea Lord has said, as Britain’s Carrier Strike Group sets sail on its first deployment.Britain’s new flagship aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, left Portsmouth on Saturday night to lead six Royal Navy ships, a Royal Navy submarine, a US Navy destroyer and a frigate from the Netherlands in the largest concentration of maritime and air power to leave the UK in a generation.The seven-month global deployment is the UK Carrier Strike Group’s maiden operational deployment.The nine ships, plus 32 aircraft and 3,700 personnel, will route through the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean and on to the Indo-Pacific. Given the proximity to Russian forces in the Black Sea and Beijing’s assertive claims to disputed areas in the South China Sea, international tensions could be inflamed.Admiral Tony Radakin, First Sea Lord, said he expected Russia and China to “behave responsibly”.“I don\u0027t expect to see the recklessness that we\u0027ve seen of Russian behaviour in the past. “I don’t expect to see aggression from China when UK forces with their allies are going about activity in a very legal and clear manner.“We’ve got to put an onus on these countries to behave responsibly. We\u0027re behaving responsibly and we will expect other nations to behave responsibly as well.”HMS Queen Elizabeth has eight F-35B Lightning II fighters from 617 Squadron, the joint Royal Navy and RAF unit, and 10 similar aircraft from the US Marine Corps embarked. Operating alongside the jets are four Wildcat maritime attack helicopters, seven Merlin Mk2 anti-submarine helicopters and three Merlin Mk4 commando helicopters. It is the largest number of helicopters assigned to a single UK Task Group in a decade.He said the review was also “very clear-eyed about Chinese expansionism”.“What we\u0027re going to be signalling with the carrier strike group is as much aimed at Russia and China, as it is to our Nato allies, to our allies in the Middle East, to our allies in South Asia, to our allies in the Asia Pacific.”The Carrier Strike Group will engage with over 40 nations during its 26,000-nautical-mile global tour, undertaking over 70 engagements, exercises and operations with allies and partners. The maritime force will be joined by French Aircraft Carrier Charles De Gaulle for a period of dual carrier operations in the Mediterranean and participate in Exercise Bersama Lima to mark the 50th anniversary of the Five Powers Defence Arrangements between Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and the UK.Air Chief Marshal Wigston said the “strategic message” of the deployment was the power of multilateralism and working with allies. “We will have many audiences,” he said.“China and Russia will be just two of them.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"trucks fresh water used feed taiwans semiconductors crops left","story":"The world’s largest microchip maker is buying tanker trucks full of water to keep its plant going as farmers struggle to make ends meet during the worst drought in the history of Taiwan.The Taiwanese government this week said it would tighten water rationing from June 1 in the semiconductor making hubs of Hsinchu and Taichung if there is no significant rainfall by then. This would require companies to cut water consumption by 17 per cent.Chip manufacturing requires a significant amount of water, and the shortfall in Taiwan, the rainswept island that hasn\u0027t seen a typhoon in the last last year, has sounded alarm bells across the world.The global economy is suffering from a major shortage of semiconductors that are key to almost all consumer appliances and vehicles.A cut in supply from factories shut by Covid first hit the market last year, but a surge in spending on electrical items during lockdown has savaged the industry.The automotive sector is by far the hardest hit, with Ford, Volkswagen and Jaguar Land Rover shutting down factories and laying off workers.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world’s largest chipmaker, told the  it had a contingency plan for the punishing drought compounding global supply issues further.“We have initiated some measures including cutting back water usage and ordering water by tanker trucks for some of our facilities. So far there’s no impact on production and we are closely monitoring the water supply situation,” said a spokesperson.But the 18-month drought, which has seen reservoirs in the island’s central and southern region plunge below 5 per cent of capacity, not only threatens Taiwan’s technological dominance, it has damaged farmers’ livelihoods and revived calls for long term action over climate change.In parts of central Taiwan, taps are now turned off two days a week.With climate change accelerating, it is a sign that we have to think about how to transform,” said farmer Liu Cheng-yu, 37, who is facing significant losses from his rice paddy fields due to irrigation restrictions.  “That means our previous investment and effort will go to waste completely, and we won\u0027t be able to earn any income,” he said. We are desperately looking for other water resources to prevent the irrigation from halting.”Mr Liu said he saw the crisis as an opportunity, but other farmers believe they have been shortchanged to save the chip industry.“We had no choice but to stop planting for this season,” said Ho Wan-chin, 57, who was forced to lease his 100 hectares of land in Hsinchu county fallow.The government\u0027s policy has always prioritised water supply to industries like the Hsinchu Science Park,” he said. “We are frustrated by the drought, and with climate change, drought will only happen again in the future.”The island’s Greenpeace chapter agrees, concluding that Taiwan will face a more intense drought by 2030 if nothing is done to reduce carbon emissions.“Because of semiconductors and the regulation of domestic water use, the public awareness of climate change has indeed increased. However, climate change is never the focus of the discussion,” said June Liu, climate and energy campaigner.“A long-term and climate-orientated water management policy is lacking and must be built up as soon as possible. Crossing fingers is not how we deal with risks.”Dr Hsu Huang-hsiung, a climate change expert at Taiwan’s Academia Sinica, said that although this year’s drought was likely more attributable to bad luck rather than proven to be global warming, that it served as a wake-up call for the island.“This has been a good lesson for the Taiwanese people and government to learn,” he said. “Although this particular event was not necessarily caused by global warming, similar phenomena occurred so that we know that our water resources policy is not well planned.”The island needed to address leakage in water pipes, hike consumption prices, and explore other water resources like retention pools, he said.“I think the government will start to come up with better plans for long term policies for water resources for the future.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"truth british railways werent privatised enough","story":"Theresa May, infamously, borrowed heavily from the Miliband manifesto: Boris Johnson has taken it up a notch with a policy straight out of a Corbynista dream. Renationalising the railways.Network Rail, under the guise of a new quango, “Great British Railways,” will subsume responsibilities for track, signalling and the largest stations while also taking charge of timetables and managing ticketing and revenue. Rather than franchises paying the state for access to tracks and receiving the ticket revenue, companies will be paid to operate certain routes in a centrally coordinated system.Many are claiming this vindicates criticisms of privatisation, but privately owned railways have consistently outperformed nationalised services in Britain. Private companies built Britain’s railways in the 19th century. Nationalisation in the mid-20th century was an unmitigated disaster: there was a e in passenger numbers, a lack of investment and the Beeching cuts which diminished the network.Privatisation led to a renaissance. In 1995, there were 761 million rail journeys. This more than doubled to 1.75 billion by 2019. There are new and faster services, improved safety and billions invested. Trains have been modernised with improved bistros and features like Wi-Fi. Despite the myth, Brits do not pay more than continental Europeans for similar journeys.The system was not perfect. The Government had already taken over operation of the East Coast and Northern franchises after financial collapse. The final straw was a pandemic-induced reduction in passengers, which crashed revenues. Brits also came to expect much more after privatisation, which has at times led to disappointment, with overcrowding and delays.Private train operators lacked the freedom or competitive pressures afforded to other private sector businesses. The government neither gave companies full control over tracks, trains and stations — as historically was the case and works well in Japan – nor did they allow competition between operators on the same lines. Nor could they dictate fares, open new routes or tinker with the timetable to match supply to demand. These were all set in advance in contracts.Even with their hands tied behind their back, private operators expanded the railway system and innovated well. Imagine what a truly privatised, commercialised and innovative railway system could have produced. Sadly that day is still yet to come.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic cummings says herd immunity","story":"NewsDominic Cummings says herd immunity was UK policy in latest swipe at Boris JohnsonDominic Cummings has accused the Health Secretary of spreading \"bull****\" – and claims lockdowns could have been avoided altogether \" we’d had the right preparations and competent people in charge\"mirrorShareCommentsByLaurie ChurchmanKaren Rockett:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video cummings-says-dept-health-an-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:jxaqpok,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy notice Dominic Cummings has said the Government originally intended to let coronavirus rip through the community in an attempt to build herd immunity.The PMaposs former right hand man says the governmentaposs initial Covid strategy was herd immunity by September – and blasted claims to the contrary by Health Secretary Matt Hancock as bull****. No  has repeatedly denied it pursued the controversial tactic of allowing Covid- to spread unchecked. But in a series of tweets Mr Cummings said the idea was only abandoned in early March after Downing Street was warned it would lead to a catastrophe. He claimed herd immunity was literally the official plan in all docs graphs meetings until it was ditched.  Mr Cummingsapos latest intervention comes as he prepares to give evidence to MPs investigating the Governmentaposs response to the pandemic this week. He said all three country-wide lockdowns could have been entirely avoidedthere were competent people in charge and ministers had made the right preparations. He described the Governmentaposs strategy as AWOL disaster and claimed the first lockdown in March was only necessary because awful decisions were made. As well as accusing Health Secretary Mr Hancock of lying, Cummings attacked the media for accepting the Governmentaposs denials. He tweeted yesterday: Media generally abysmal on Covid but even Iaposve been surprised by one thing: how many hacks have parroted Hancockaposs line that aposherd immunity wasnapost the planapos when aposherd immunity by Septemberapos was aposliterally the official plan in all documents graphs meetingsapos until it was ditched.  Yes the media is often incompetent but something deeper is at work: much of SWwas happy to believe Hancockaposs bull**** that apositaposs not the planapos so they didnapost have to face the shocking truth. Most political hacks believe in aposthe systemapos... In week of March , No was made aware by ious people that the official plan would lead to catastrophe. It was then replaced by Plan B. But how aposherd immunity by Septemberapos could have been the plan until that week is a fundamental issue in the whole disaster. At the time, the Governmentaposs chief scientic adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, had said thatthey tried to suppress the disease very, very hard it would simply bounce back when restrictions were released.  Instead he suggested the aim was to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people were resistant to the disease and transmission was reduced. In his tweets, Mr Cummings said there had been so much lockdown confusion. Obviously theyaposre aposdestructiveapos. Butyou have to do it because alternative is aposhundreds of thousands choking to death and no NHS for months for everybody  and economy sunk because everybody hiding in terrorapos then earlier harder is better for health AND economy, he wrote. If weaposd had the right preparations and competent people in charge, we would probably have avoided lockdown , aposdefinitelyapos no need for lockdowns  and . Given the plan was AWOL disaster and awful decisions delayed everything, lockdown  became necessary.  The former top aide is said to be planning a devastating critique of the PMaposs leadership when he appears before a joint session of the health and science committees on Wednesday.No  has been bracing for the next attack from Cummings for some time, after he was accused of leaking messages from the PMaposs phone last month – and then went on the offensive. Cummings denied he was behind the leaks and launched a fierce tirade against his former boss – accusingBoris Johnson of unethical, foolishpossibly illegal behaviour. Cummings has reportedly spent weeks readying a store of secret documents that could deliver a devastating blow to Johnson.The ex-aide had access to some of the most confidential information in government before he was booted out last year.Responding to Mr Cummingsapos tweets, a government spokesperson said: Herd immunity has never been a policy aim or part of our coronavirus strategy.  Our response has at all times been focused on saving lives and ensuring the NHS was not overwhelmed. We continue to be guided by the latest scientic advice. Last month, he attacked the PMaposs competence and integrity in an online blog post. Mr Cummings left No  in November last year after an apparent deterioration of relations with Mr Johnson. The pair had been close allies on the Vote Leave campaign and Mr Cummings played a key role in the Tory election victory in  and the early days of Mr Johnsonaposs premiership.

But he experienced a sensational fall from grace after he broke lockdown restrictions last year, making a journey from London to County Durham and Barnard Castle. The Mirror revealed he had driven  miles while his we had coronavirus symptoms. Mr Cummings then gave a bizarre hour-long press conference in the Downing Street garden. He claimed a trip to Barnard Castle from his family farm - where he should have been isolating - was to test his eyesight.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnWestminsterNHSJohnsonsConservative PartyBoris JohnsonPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"both uk covid 19 vaccines","story":"NewsBoth UK Covid- vaccines confirmed as highly effective against Indian iantPublic Health England have announced that both the Pfizer or AstraZeneca jabs cope with the Indian strain - but there is a scramble to get people their second dose as one jab is only % effectivemirrorShareCommentsByJohn Siddle:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsSoldiers from the Royal Horse Artillery help with the door to door leafleting efforts to encourage Covid vaccination uptake in Halliwell, Bolton \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Two doses of Pfizer or AstraZeneca jabs give only slightly less protection than against the dominant Kent strain. But one jab is only % effective – prompting a scramble to deliver more. The battle is on to give people two coronavirus jabs after ­scientists revealed tonight that a double dose is highly ­effective against the new ­mutant Indian strain. Two doses of Pfizer or AstraZeneca deliver only slightly less protection than against the dominant Kent strain. Public Health England revealed the good news as soldiers from the Royal Horse Artillery joined the fight against the Indian iant.  They went door to door with leaflets to encourage Covid vaccination uptake in the virus hot spot of Halliwell in Bolton, Lancs. According to PHE, the Pfizer vaccine is % effective against symptoms of the iant after a second shot, compared with % against the Kent strain. The research – which came as England today passed  million vaccinations – was heralded as ­groundbreaking by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. The number of Brits who have had their first jab is nearly  million while . million have had two. Mr Hancock said: “We can now be confident that over  million people – more than one in three – have signicant protection against this new iant, and that number is growing by the hundreds of thousands every single day.”  But scientists tonight sounded a note of caution as it emerged both vaccines are just % effective against symptoms of the Indian iant after one dose. One shot of either vaccine delivers % protection against the Kent iant ­after three weeks. Scientists called on ministers to speed up the jabs roll-out to get doses dished out as fast as possible. Currently, the last remaining lockdown restrictions, including social distancing and masks, are set to be scrapped on June .  Prof Christina Pagel of the Independent Sage  of scientists told the Sunday People: “It is obviously good news that two doses offer very good protection. “However, one dose is not very effective from either vaccine against symptomatic disease, which is not good for the roadmap. “Given that efficacy is much higher after two doses, it seems the best option is to, at the very least, delay step four of the roadmap until all adults have been offered two doses of the vaccine. “Depending on vaccine ­availability this could be ­somewhere between late August and late September.” As of Thursday there were , documented cases of the Indian iant – officially known as B.. – up by , in a week. Six people have so far died from the strain and  taken to AE, ­according to PHE.  The Kent iant is still far more common, with , deaths since February . But experts have found that it is now being displaced in parts of London and the North West. The study looked solely at how effective the vaccines are at preventing symptoms. But scientists believe the jabs will provide even higher levels of protection against ­hospitalisation and death. This week, PHE said real-world studies found the AstraZeneca jab delivered % protection from Covid generally, a fraction less than Pfizer’s %. Dr Mary Ramsay, PHE head of immunisation, said: “This study provides reassurance that two doses of either vaccine offer high levels of protection against symptomatic ­disease from the B.. iant. “We expect the vaccines to be even more effective at preventing hospitalisation and death, so it is vital to get both doses to gain maximum protection against all existing and emerging iants.”  But % of adults have not yet had their first jab and six in ten have not had a second shot. The NHS today opened up vaccine ­appointments to people who turn  before July. Areas where the Indian iant is a major concern, such as Bolton, Blackburn and Bedford, have also ramped up their vaccine schemes to all over-s. For over-s and those with health conditions, the initial -week gap between jabs has shortened to eight weeks. But supply issues mean it is unlikely that under-s will get second doses any earlier. Under-s are being offered alternative to AstraZeneca because of a link to rare blood clots.Prof Martin McKee, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “While vaccines are extremely important in controlling the pandemic they are not­ ­completely effective. “We need to maintain great caution given the very worrying rise in infections with the B.. iant. “Those who argue that we no longer have to worry because we have made so much progress in vaccination are wrong.” Prof McKee, also an Independent Sage member, added: “The low protection among people with only one dose is worrying. The Government seems to recognise it is taking a big risk by opening up according to its timetable and is, rightly, calling on people to be cautious. “Only time will tellit has made a mistake.” Paul Hunter, professor of health protection at the University of East Anglia, said: “The main thing we can do to reduce the spread of this iant is to ensure that we get our second dose of vaccine.” Scientists tonight confirmed they are examining a new “triple mutant” Covid iant with a strange ­combination of genes.

When her co-manager opened up the next day she found the alarm had been deactivated and then discovered the safe had been emptied. CCTV was viewed which captured a man and a woman breaking in to the fast food restaurant. Plumpton denied involvement but was dismissed the next day while Wordsworth’s DNA was found on the spray can. The couple denied the offence until just three weeks before their trial was due to start when they finally admitted the burglary. Dale Brook, defending Wordsworth, told the court his client accepted full responsibility and had become desperate after racking up drug debts. He said: “My client was a man of good character before this and this is completely out of character. “He lost his mum just as he was becoming an adult. She was a central figure in his le but, while his sisters sought counselling, he did not seek help for his grief and ended up turning to drugs... When he did lose his job he still had a habit costing him several hundred pounds a week so his dents mounted. Hull Crown Court heard the couple have two children, with Plumptonaposs lawyer adding: “She is taking full responsibility and is not trying to hide away from what she has done. She has been a dedicated moth and a hard-working, diligent employee. “But my client made a terrible decision due to her partner’s mounting drug debt. “I ask the court to take into account the catastrophic impact any immediate custody will have on her children. “She will have this conviction branded on her for the rest of her le and she will have to declare it for every job she goes for. Recorder Ian Mullarkey told Plumpton and Wordsworth there had been a signicant amount of planning as well as a major breach of trust and that immediate custody was inevitable. Wordsworth was jailed for  months while Plumpton was given a slightly shorter prison sentence of  months, due to being her children’s primary carer.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBurger King Inc.CCTVCCTV footageBurglary"},{"url":null,"title":"covid rules changes indoors pubs","story":"AdvertorialWhat you can and cant do this weekend under new government Covid rulesRestrictions have eased this week in England, which means emotional reunions for many people – but we still need to follow the rules to protect our loved onesmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY AdvertorialFamilies across England are reuniting as lockdown restrictions ease and indoor hospitality is once again open, including cinemas, pubs and concert venues.

Our exclusive snap shows him getting on with Karen Roche-Pearson’s housework. Karen, , told the Sunday Mirror Bashir he “totally lied” to get her to appear on the BBC show. And the maternity nurse is relishing seeing HIS dirty linen being aired in public. Karen, courted by Bashir two years after his Panorama interview with Princess Diana, said: “He was such a creep and would ­pretend to be nice by doing my ironing. He’d say, ‘Oh, let me do that for you’.  “He comes across so nice, but he’s a nasty piece of work.” Karen claims Bashir got her to open up by promising her kids toys. He pursued her for an show after she agreed to be a surrogate for £, but ended up keeping the baby, leading to a historic legal fight with the other couple. But Karen, of Beverley, East Yorks, says Bashir betrayed her after promising the  show would portray her as the victim. She claims he said, “Trust me, I did the Diana interview,” but in the end the show “wasn’t what he said it was going to be”.  “It was supposed to be on my side, the way he did it – he just totally lied. “I was a big fan of Diana and he was saying, ‘I did the famous Diana interview’.” Karen says she turned down a large sum from a rival ITV documentary. She said: “I thought, ‘It’s Panorama, it’s the BBC, it’s going to get the truth over and nobody will doubt it.  “I wanted people to know I had gone into it for the right reasons and I’d done nothing wrong, but that didn’t happen.” Karen added: “He’s not what he presents himself as. He’s a deceitful man – he was telling us one thing and doing another. “He even took us to a fun park called Flamingo Land to film us and make it look as though we were on a day out, but in ­reality we just went on one ride for the camera and then he told us we had to leave. “I complained to the BBC at the time, but my complaints were dismissed.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

Lee Tarpeyaposs devastated we says her husband should still be here after his medication overdose death followed a stressful battle with the Department of Work and Pensions . He had told his we Kerrie Tarpey he felt he was a drain on her and could not provide for his family amid his problems with the DWP. Mr Tarpey, from St Helens in Merseyside, had been a builder for many years but had a heart attack in  which saw him fitted with three stents. He also suffered with angina and diabetes.Kerrie told the Liverpool Echo her husband had tried toto work several times but was physically unable to and so applied for support from the government.Having initially been turned down, he won an appeal in  and was awarded the lower rate of Personal Independence Payments.Have you got a story  Contact webnews@mirror But in the spring of , Kerrie said her husband was called for an assessment in which he was told that he was not unwell enough to qualy for benefits payments and that they would be stopped. His money was stopped in July of that year, and just a month later Mr Tarpey took his own le. Kerrie said: They said he was in good condition and he didnapost even score a single point, I donapost know how - but he was a proud man so wouldnapost want to seem like he needed help. In June he got the letter saying his money would be stopped, he was only getting £ a month but it made him feel like he wasnapost a drain on us - he just ripped up the letter, he didnapost want me to see it. She added: After his money was stopped in July he really went downhill. On August  he was in bed and I was downstairs with the kids, I went up to see him to say I was going to the chippy and I could tell something had happened. Lee had taken an overdose of his medication and sadly died at home despite paramedics trying to save his le for over an hour. Kerrie said: He had left me a note which said he was sorry for not being the man to provide for us, it said he didnapost deserve to live because he was a drain on us. Kerrie, who is a hairdresser, met Lee in , and the couple had three children together who are now , , and . She said there is not a day goes by that she doesnapost think about her husband and feels constant anger for what happened to him. She said: I think about him every day, Iaposm always thinking about him. Iaposve got so much anger inside me, my husband should still be here, he was my arms and I was his legs - we were all each other knew - had been together since .  I still canapost believe whataposs happened. She believes the system currently used by the DWP for assessing people on benefits and awarding them points based on a limited interaction is flawed. She added: I just think itaposs disgusting. These assessments that they do are not right, proud people like Lee may not admit how unwell they are, but he couldnapost work - he wanted to and he tried to go back, but he physically couldnapost. He only wanted the £ a month he had been receiving so that he could get by and not feel like he was a drain on us, he couldnapost physically work. Kerrie said she has not previously spoken out about her husbandaposs death because it was too raw and she was worried about the impact on her children. She added: The children agree with me now that we donapost want this to happen to another family. A DWP spokesperson said: “Our sincere condolences are with Mr Tarpey’s family. “Our decisions are made using information that’s available to us at the time from a person’s GP or medical specialist to help ensure people receive all the financial support they are entitled to.”  aposSlipping through the netapos Meanwhile, an investigation has shown that the tragic deaths of a man and woman in Cornwall who were refused benefits were not isolated incidents.Research carried out by the BBC has shown that the deaths of Nathan Hartwell and Jan Mandeville, who both died in  after contact with the DWP, were among  deaths allegedly linked to the department since .Since , four Prevention of Future Death reports have been issued to the DWP by coroners following investigations and inquests into the deaths of benefits claimants. Mr Hartwell, , was found dead from heart failure in January  just hours before a Citizens Advice appointment about his case, according to press reports from the time. He had contracted a flesh-eating bug aged  and needed vein transplants. His disability became so severe he was forced to give up work at .He was appealing the reduction of his Disability Living Allowance after the DWP became aware he did a charity bike ride despite a flesh-eating bug that made walking painful, Cornwall Live reports. Mr Hartwell was told by doctors before one operation that he might lose a leg and died of heart failure after an -month battle with the ­DWP. The department had stopped his allowance and accused him of lying about his condition. But reports by two surgeons would later reveal that although walking caused him pain - he could ride a bike. Jan Mandeville, , of Truro, had been receiving Employment and Support Allowance but had been unsuccessful in applying for Disability Living Allowance while she had fibromyalgia, cancer, depression and anxiety. She was hospitalised with stress after the removal of the so-called bedroom tax meant she could not afford to stay in her house, and she downsized. The grandmother was found dead at her new home and, according to her family, her death was hastened when she was forced to move home despite her fatal illness. Reports at the time detailed how Jan said that the worry made her so ill that she ended up in hospital with stress. Her distraught daughter Nicola Braithwaite said her mother was left to slip through the net. A DWP spokesperson said of the Cornwall cases: “We support millions of people a year and our priority is that they get the benefits to which they are entitled promptly and receive a supportive and compassionate service. “In the vast majority of cases this happens but when, sadly, there is a tragic case we take it very seriously. “In those circumstances it’s absolutely right we carry out an internal review to checkthe correct processes were followed and identy any lessons learned to inform future policy and service.”If youaposre struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open   on  .

They hit the jackpot after their postcode,NP LG, in the Welsh town of New Tredegar, was drawn as a big winner.And theyaposre already planning a bumper street party to celebrate the le-changing news. Among the winners are an NHS nurse, a set of relations and a winner who recently suffered heartbreak at the hands of covid. Support worker Gareth Walbeoff, , lost his father to the pandemic in January. He said: My poor mum was having to isolate for  days, so only I could go to console her, none of the other family could go. “Then she unfortunately fell and broke her back, she’s up and about now and my niece is taking her to a hospital appointment today. My niece is really good to mum, I couldn’t manage without her. She’s got three children and my nephew has a little girl as well. What I’m going to do is pay for all these kids to have a good holiday in a big -star, luxury caravan in Tenby for two weeks!  He also congratulated his neighbours and added: “In this street we all are like one big family. When it’s safe to do so we’re going to have one hell of a street party!”Gareth wasn’t the only member of his family to get a call from lottery ambassador Danyl Johnson . One of the other winners was -year-old Alan Vaughan whose partner, Nicola, is Gareth’s cousin.Another winner from the street was NHS nurse Tina Watkinswho learned of her windfall while on a break at work. As the cheque was revealed, the -year-old clapped with joy and said: “Woo!  grand! Oh that’s fantastic, thank you very much!” Her co-workers cheered on hearing the total and Tina said she would buy her manager, who was holding Tina’s camera phone over the call, ‘a nice big cake.’ Tina already had plans for some of her winnings: She added: “I’ve got a house renovation going on, so I can plough it into that and buy my son a car. What a lovely surprise, I can finish off what I want to do with the house without having to save. “Maybe a holiday next year. Our holiday to Fuerteventura was cancelled this year, but we might go further afield now.” People’s Postcode Lottery ambassador Danyl Johnson sent his congratulations to all the winners. He said: “What a fantastic surprise for our winners in New Tredegar! I can tell it is a really close community, so I was thrilled to bring this great news. “Congratulations to them and all our other winners today, I’m sure they’ll enjoy their winnings.” Everyday throughout the April draws one postcode was announced as a £, prize winner. All the players in the postcode won £, for every ticket they hold. People’s Postcode Lottery costs £ a month to play and there are guaranteed winners every day. People play with their chosen postcode and are automatically entered into all draws.A minimum of % of ticket sales goes directly to charities and players of People’s Postcode Lottery have helped raise over £ million to date for thousands of good causes across Britain and internationally.

The business has already made £m in turnover with more than , customers nationally - but Mark, from Altrincham, says it was never about the money. He first got the idea when medication prescribed for his mother Judith, who is in her late s, didnapost seem to help with her swollen joints. Judith suffers from osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis and Mark was determined to find a solution to the problem. He started to research alternative solutions in an attempt to make things easier for her to walk around - thataposs when he came across collagen.“I told my mum that I needed to try and find something to help her,” he told Manchester Evening News.“I spoke to numerous doctors and specialists and they kept mentioning that people over the age of  start losing collagen and that will result in weakened skin and bones.  “So, I started looking into it and managed to find some collagen for my mum. Three weeks after using it, she said she wasn’t sureit was a placebo effect or not but she started feeling better.” He started passing round bottles to his mum’s friends and other elderly people in the local community and they all started to saying the same thing - their skin felt improved and they noticed a change in their hair and nails. Already in business as a co-founder of PPI company The Genius Group, Mark thought he could be onto a good thing. Alongside work partner Chris Niebel, he came up with Reverse Le and the business was born. “A lot of people said it was pretty crazy of us to be starting a business while we’re in lockdown,” Mark explains. “But my argument was that we’re providing something to the people who can’t go to see the doctor and can’t go to see the beauty therapist because of the lockdown and shielding. “In a way, it really was the perfect time to start this.” The product features a ‘magic formula’ of ,mg of marine collagen, which is said to aid with skin strength alongside minimising wrinkles and elasticity.  Almost overnight, the product proved to be a runaway success. Within the first two months, they had already sold £, worth of products and were constantly selling out of stock. Set to launch in Australia and America in the next few months, Reverse Le is now also set to appear on the stock market with an evaluation in the millions. “Just this week we’ve been approached to float on the stock market - it’s an unbelievable evaluation and we’re over the moon,” Mark adds. “In a few month’s time, this tiny Manchester business is going to be on the stock exchange. “We’ve been told that when Virgin Wines floated on the market for £m, they had , clients and an average client value of £. Our average client value is more than that in just six months with over , clients. “We’re expecting to be a £ m company in the next  months from now. It’s unheard of.” During the height of the pandemic and as Reverse Le was just finding its feet, Mark and Chris donated , Covid test kits to doctors and nurses working in Manchester hospitals. Mark says it was a part of his ethos of not standing around and waiting for change to come. “We’re a tiny company in the speck of it but I felt we needed to do something,” he says. “I know nurses were crying their eyes out saying they were terried of going into work. We paid for the kits and got them independently tested. “I’ve spoken to billionaires and asked them to help and they’ve just turned round and said it’s not their problem, it’s not their issue. “To say that it wasn’t their problem, when surely someone in their family will need to go to hospital at some point, was really shocking to hear. “I’ve always been brought up to be a parallel universe kind of person so I couldn’t just sit back and do nothing.

Nick Breese, , from Powys, suffered a blood clot on his lung and medics were sadly unable to save his le. His son Casey was just  when he was killed in  after a goalpost fell on him while he was out playing with his friends.In an unthinkable set of circumstances Casey’s -year-old sister Kelly died only two years later in a fatal accident when the car she was driving crashed and hit a tree, Wales Online reports.Now Nickaposs niece and Casey and Kellyaposs cousin is desperate to make a dference in their memory by raising thousands of pounds for the Welsh Air Ambulance, which tried to save them. Speaking about her cousins, Ffion Jones said: “Casey is two years older than me and Kelley, she’s four years older than me. We’d go over to each other’s houses, we used to go on holidays to Pwllheli. We had a caravan and we’d go on activities like a day out on the boat around the lakes and things like that.”  Now -years-old, nursery assistant Ffion has fond memories of growing up with her two cousins in the tight-knit village of Clatter, near Caersws. As well as having the support of the rural community around them, she says her family have helped each other through the dficult moments over the last -years, supporting Casey and Kelly’s older sisters Laura and Natasha and parents Shan and Nick. Speaking about Casey’s death in , Ffion said: “Casey was out in the football field in Caersws, he was playing football and he was in goal. When he went into goal he went to get the ball and he managed to get his foot stuck in the net. As you do you tug it out and while he was doing so the goalpost toppled down, it was a metal one, and landed on his back so he was flat on his stomach on the floor. “He was with a couple of his mates and they were only around  or  years old at the time. The goal post was that heavy that they couldn’t lt it off him so they went to go and get some help.”  Despite the best efforts of emergency services, including the Welsh Air Ambulance, Casey was rushed to hospital but could not be saved. Thinking about her cousin now, the words that come to Ffion’s mind are: “Cheeky, very cheeky.” She added: “He always had a smile on his face. If you saw him he would put his thumbs up, that’s the thing he would always do. He loved football, he played for Caersws Football Club anyway and he loved his sport and his bikes as well. “I was still in primary school myself and being so young it’s quite hard to grasp and get your head around it, to know that he’s gone. It was such a freak accident it’s not something that happens every day, it was completely out of the blue. “I remember his funeral was absolutely massive. Hundreds of people turned up for it. It was that big that it ended up having a police escort there because it was so big. Being in a village everyone knows everyone and him being a boy of such a young age.” On  October, , Ffion’s family received news that few others could ever imagine. At  years old Casey’s older sister, health and social care student Kelly, was involved in a fatal accident on the B between Llanwnog and Aberhafesp, near Newtown. Looking back, Ffion describes Kelly, who had been attending Newtown college, as a “beautul soul” who was caring and kind. She said: “It was a single person crash, there was no-one  involved and when she crashed she crashed into a tree unfortunately. That was a freak accident, she wasn’t speeding, she wasn’t on her phone, the road conditions weren’t wet so we literally don’t know what happened. “There was huge support, everyone was doing as much as they could to help the family out but it was a massive shock.” Despite everything that’s happened, Ffion remains determined to stay positive and to do everything she can to help others. In the last year she has raised more than £, for the Welsh Air Ambulance and Alder Hey Children’s Hospital in Liverpool by planning a charity skye in her cousins’ honour. A vital leline for rural communities, Ffion’s reason for picking the air ambulance as one of her charities of choice is simple: “You never know when you’re going to need it. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, however, Ffion’s skye was cancelled in August last year. It was at that time that her family experienced yet more heartbreak with the sudden and unexpected death of her uncle Nick - Casey and Kelly’s father.At only  years old, the dad-of-four had suffered a blood clot on his lung. On top of his work as a builder, Ffion paid tribute to an uncle who was the ever-supportive “rock” of the family and a talented chef who would always be in charge of the kitchen at family events.On the day of his funeral local residents lined the streets to pay their respects at at time where they were unable to attend the service due to coronavirus restrictions.Ffion said: “It was a complete shock. He just had a bit of what he thought was indigestion, a tight chest. He was working at the time and didn’t feel right and he ended up being taken into hospital by ambulance. We had a phone call saying things aren’t looking good and he was in hospital and probably an hour later we had a phone call saying he’d passed away from a blood clot on the lung “He was fine, you wouldnapost know any dferent really.”  Speaking about her skying challenge, she added: “Because it was meant to be last year I was doing my sky e I’d discussed it with Shan and Nick. They were very supportive of it, they both said they were going to come down to the event and watch and support me. They were helping me to raise funds and sponsoring me so they’re very proud.” As well as the Welsh Air Ambulance, Ffion is also raising money for the Alder Hey Children’s Hospital as a way of thanking them for saving her friend. In  Ffion’s childhood friend Willow experienced a cardiac arrest due to an ongoing heart condition aged . After falling to the ground her sister performed CPR until Willow was taken to the Liverpool hospital where they saved her le. Thankfully she has now made a full recovery and is “making the most of le and enjoying every moment.” Ffion’s sky e is now due to take place on August . After reaching her initial goal of £, she is now hoping to meet her new target of £, by holding dferent fundraising events leading up to the summer. She said: “A sky e is something I’ve always wanted to from a young age. I put it off for a little bit and thoughtI’m going to do it I’m going to do it for a cause. Because the Welsh Air Ambulance and Alder Hay Hopsital are two charities that are close to me I thought I would try and raise as much money as I can and jump out an air plane at the same time. “A lot of my family were shocked, they thought I must be crazy. My dad said he would pay me not to do it, he hates heights.” Dougie Bancroft, Wales Air Ambulance community co-ordinator, said: “Ffion has already raised an incredible £, in aid of two important causes. Despite the heartache the family has suffered Ffion has taken it upon herself to jump out of a plane in memory of her cousins’ and uncle to raise money for charity. What a lovely tribute to remember her loved ones by. Thank you so much Ffion and good luck with the skye.”You can donate to Ffion’sfundraising campaign here.

Kayleigh Stephens, , has been trying to conceive with her husband, Nathan Stephens, for  years - but suffered health issues including an eating disorder and a cyst that got in the way. And after two failed rounds of IVF treatment, her dream of having children looked even further away from becoming a reality. But thanks to her heroic younger sister, Shauna Smith, she may have found the answer sheaposs been searching for.Mum-of-three Shauna told of how heartbreaking is it to watch her sister cry every day because she canapost have children, Teesside Live reports.The sisters, who both live in Lingdale, are just beginning their journey but have shared their story to raise awareness of the struggles some couples face in conceiving.  Kayleigh, a reablement assistant in a rehabilitation centre, said: Since being a teenager Iaposve always wanted kids. About  years ago, me and my husband started trying for kids. We tried for about two years and nothing happened and we werenapost falling pregnant. We decided to go to the doctors to seethere was anything wrong. We were referred to [hospital] and my husbandaposs tests came back fine - there was no issues with him. Kayleigh underwent keyhole surgery to investigate the matter further. The operation revealed that her fallopian tubes were blocked and she had a cyst on her oy, along with a heart-shaped womb. After two rounds of IVF, she became depressed and developed an eating disorder which added to the dficulties and saw her rapidly shed  dress sizes in three months.  I lost quite a lot of weight quite quickly - I went from a size  to a size six in around three months, she said. I was constantly exercising and living on caffeine. It was affecting my work too. Kayleigh was diagnosed with anorexia and put on a course of treatment including medications and therapy, after which her condition began to improve. Now her health problems are starting to look better, sheaposs thinking about the future. She says that because her eggs arenapost good quality, the couple decided not to go ahead with another cycle of IVF.  Adoption was another option, but Shauna then stepped in and offered the greatest gt a sister can give - by agreeing to be a surrogate. Kayleigh explained: My sister offered to be my surrogate but we were looking at between £, to £, for one cycle of treatment. Thataposs a lot of money for me and my partner so weaposve researched and weaposre going to do surrogacy from home. My sister is doing ovulation tests and weaposre doing the insemination at home.  The family say it is legal to undertake and Nathan will be the biological father of the baby, giving him parental rights from birth. Kayleigh will then legally adopt the baby after six-months. Shauna told how she has previously fallen pregnant easily and sailed through her pregnancies. She told how it was very dficult when she had her two youngest children as she knew how heartbreaking it was for Kayleigh. Shauna added: I actually feel better when Iaposm pregnant, I feel healthier. Kayleigh has asked before and Iaposve said no because Iaposve had my own kids. But now Iaposm  per cent sure I donapost want any more.

Three-year-old Dayaal Kaur could name all the planets in the solar system when she was just two and has maths and literacy skills that far exceed her age. Proud dad Sarbjit Singh says they knew they were on their way to raising a child genius when she began chatting before she was even out of nappies. And when her parents took her for a Mensa test to check, little Dayaal wowed her assessor by scoring  on the test - not far off Albert Einstein. After her admission to the famous society, Dayaal was offered a place at a private school in Edgbaston at a reduced scholarship fee.However, Sarbjit says that even with the discount it sadly remains beyond their means, reports Birmingham Live.Dayaal has been accepted into their local primary school and Sarbjit is currently pushing for her to be moved up a school year to ensure she is challenged and stimulated in her learning.  It’s like having a Bentley and not being able to drive,” said Sarbjit, who works at Ruskin Mill Trust college in Stourbridge. Dayaalaposs parents say their daughteraposs intelligence was at the .th percentile for her age and that she had the word recognition and maths abilities of a five-year-old. When the toddler started nursery, their suspicions were confirmed as the manager wrote to them saying that in  years she had never come across a child like Dayaal. Iaposve always talked to Dayaal in an adult way, not using baby talk and no matter what I said to her she’d understand, from popping something into the bin to going to get a nappy,” said Sarbjit, whose we Raj works as a solicitor. “She could follow adult films like The Martian and understand the plot and the funny bits. We’d be in a supermarket and she’d strike up a conversation at the till, asking people about their kids and how old they were. People would turn to me and ask how old she was and I’d say two.  The nursery manager wrote us a letter saying Dayaal far exceeded any provision they could provide, he said. She said in  years of childcare she’d never come across a child like her who was not just academic but sociable with a sense of humour too.” During lockdown, the parents decided to have Dayaalaposs intelligence formally tested to better gauge her mental capacity. “We sat outside the room by the stairs and all we could hear was Lynn Kendalllaughing with Dayaal and, when we came back in, she said you need to sit down for this, he said. She explained that Mensa only accepts the top five per cent in the UK and she said that Dayaal was in the top . per cent, he added.  She said that put her in the top tier of the top tier. She said that her IQ was  at the age of three. Apparently Einstein’s top IQ was  and I’m not sure how old he was when that was measured. “She said that Dayaal really is extraordinary, that she’s a warm girl with an amazing sense of fun. She said it’s a real novelty to meet someone who had such a high IQ that was so down to earth. Sarbjit sadly ended up in a coma after contracting Covid last year, and said it was Dayaal talking to him through an iPad in hospital that saved his le. Fortunately heaposs recovered well since. In her report, assessor Lynn Kendall said: Dayaal is an exceptionally able little girl whose intelligence falls at the .th percentile for her age. “I would rarely recommend accelerating a child out of their year group. However, given Dayaal’s ability and maturity, in this case, it might be something worth considering.  “At home, parents should focus on broadening Dayaal’s interests rather than focussing on maths and English. Geography, nature, history, science, the environment and culture are all barely touched by schools, particularly at this age, and will ensure that Dayaal has a broad knowledge base from which to work. “It is also important that she starts to develop a strong level of resilience. Dayaal is a delightful little girl with a very grown up manner and a great sense of fun. Dayaalaposs scores were measured at: Letter and word recognition: Dayaal has a ‘working at’ level of  years and  months Reading comprehension: Dayaal has a ‘working at’ level of  years and  months Math concepts: Dayaal has a ‘working at’ level of  years and  monthsFOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnAlbert EinsteinMensaEducationSchoolsChildcare"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeTheirs is a friendship born out of tragedy but the bond between Jenny Dees and Laura Sugden is unbreakable. For they both carry the pain of almost unimaginable loss. Laura’s boyfriend Shane Gilmer died after being attacked by a crossbow maniac who also shot her in the head while five months pregnant. She was lucky to survive. Jenny’s six-year-old son Stanley Metcalf was shot in the stomach by his great-grandfather who has never apologised for the youngster’s death. But today the two women tell how they are helping each other through their sorrow – and how new baby daughters are helping them to heal. After her son’s death Jenny longed to have a baby and the arrival of Tilly, now  months, has not only given her and partner Andy Metcalf hope but the future, but also helped Stanley’s twin sister Elsie, nine, come to terms with her sense of emptiness.  Jenny says: “When I went into labour I took Stanley’s bear to hospital which had his ashes in it so it felt like he was looking over me the whole time. “As soon as Tilly arrived she came up onto my chest and turned her face towards me. It was a beautul moment, like Stanley was there and watching over us. “I was so sad because Stanley was gone but overjoyed that Tilly had been born. I turned to the bear and said ‘thank you, Stanley’” For Laura, it was the birth of Shane’s daughter Ella, now two, that gave her the courage to carry on too. Jenny and Laura, who live just nine miles apart, are now pouring their shared anguish into a crusade to make it illegal to own dangerous weapons without a licence.  Jenny’s football-mad son Stanley died in July  after the curious youngster asked her grandfather Albert Grannon to show him a modied air rle, which was unlicensed. After the gun went off, fatally injured Stanley’s final words were: “Why have you shot me, grandad ” The pellet left a hole the size of a p in his abdomen, but he suffered catastrophic internal bleeding. Six months earlier, Laura, , was shot in the head by deranged neighbour Anthony Lawrence. She watched Shane’s le slip away in front of her after a bolt embedded in his spine.  The women met after Jenny heard about Laura’s story on a regional TV news report following our exclusive interview with her last month. Jenny, , of Hull, says: “I just felt I had to reach out.” The pair want strict regulations to stop people owning weapons without a licence or checks on mental health. In the UK crossbows can easily be bought online for around £, while currently most air rles do not require owners to hold any certication. “We don’t want anyone to ever go through what we have,” says Jenny. “Laura and I both know what it’s like to feel that pain of losing someone in such a horrible way and how it always stays with you. It’s there first thing in the morning and last thing at night.”  At a park near Laura’s home the two women talk of how much they have in common how those first few months of loss “made it hard to do the simplest of things”, how they both suffer from anxiety and post-traumatic stress and are tormented by questions that may not be answered. While they have much to share, it’s clear to see they are at dferent stages of grieving. Laura is still angry that the love of her le was taken away in such a random act of brutality, while Jenny appears quieter, almost hollowed out by grief. Laura is still scarred from the night she found Lawrence hiding in the bedroom of her home in Southburn, near Drfield, Yorks, that it took her two years for her to live alone with Ella and daughter Isabelle, now nine. Even now she has removed every door from her upstairs rooms. “I know nothing like that is ever likely to happen again but I just need to be able to see inside every room from the top of the stairs. It helps me cope,” she explains.  “After Shane died I lived with family for months and months because I was too scared to live alone. I would have happily lived with them forever but I knew I had to get my own place eventually.” Both tried counselling in the weeks after the killings but neither were able to cope. Only now is Jenny getting help for the enormity of losing Stanley, made all the more dficult by the fact it was her own grandfather’s fault. Police said retired ship worker Grannon, known as Sam, “showed no real remorse” for shooting the youngster, initially refusing to accept responsibility by insisting he had been wounded by a ricochet. Ballistics tests later proved the pellet had been a direct hit.  Grannon, , was jailed three years after pleading guilty to manslaughter by gross negligence and the unauthorised possession of a gun in July . He was released in January. Jenny says: “I can’t believe he hasn’t apologised or shown any remorse after all this time. “For the first few weeks I defended him, then I’d hear he was in the pub with his mates and I started to get angry. I’d know him all my le and would say I was his favourite granddaughter, yet he’d killed my son and didn’t have a word to say about it. Nothing.” Laura’s twisted neighbour Lawrence, , killed himself in the days after the attack so there has been no court case and no answers as to why he went on his rampage.  Investigators believed he had spent a year listening to the couple through the walls of their semi-detached homes before breaking in through the loft and lying in wait for them. Laura is still tortured by her belief that Shane, , would have survived had ambulance staff not been delayed getting into their home while waiting for clearance from firearms officers. She says: “Shane died because he bled out. He was strong and stayed alive for almost three hours when he was shot. I keep asking myself what would have happenedhe’d have reached hospital earlier.” An inquest ruled the delays were sadly “inevitable”. A trauma specialist at the hearing also called his injuries “devastating”. Both women say they will never get over their trauma, but they also agree the birth of their babies has helped them rebuild their lives slowly.  Laura confesses: “I didn’t knowI’d be able to cope with bringing up Ella without Shane but she’s a part of him I still have. I look at her and she’s so like her daddy.” While Laura worried about bringing up her daughter alone, Jenny said despite having the support of Andy, he was “more reserved” about the idea of having another child because “he worried I wouldn’t be able to cope with any more lossthe IVF didn’t work out”. Jenny explains: “In the end we decided to have just one round of IVF and seeit was meant to be and it was. “Tilly isn’t a replacement for Stanley. I don’t want to replace him, but of course strange things go through your mind during pregnancy like ‘will the baby be Stanley reincarnated’.

We feel so lucky to have her.” And, as their daughters grow up, both women are determined that Shane and Stanley’s legacy will live on through a change in the law. “What happened was so horric, just indescribable really,” Jenny says. “But we are both determined to get the laws changed to protect others. Both our cases prove that new rules around weapons are needed and we are both determined to get there.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnGrievingCourt caseMental healthSunday PeopleGun crimeCrime"},{"url":null,"title":"new coronavirus dogs now infecting","story":"NewsNew coronavirus from dogs is now infecting children, study findsA new study in Clinical Infectious Diseases found samples of the virus were discovered in Malaysia in , but experts do not believe there is reason to expect it to turn into another pandemicmirrorShareCommentsByMark Waghorn:,  MAY NewsAll patients who contracted the newly-uncovered virus made a full recovery \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

If correct it would be the eighth such virus known to jump from animals to humans - and the first to come from a dog. But it is not thought to be a pandemic risk at the moment, and all those who tested positive had recovered. The study in Clinical Infectious Diseases could help prevent future outbreaks, experts say. Coronaviruses are expected to become more frequent as humans will have more contact with wildle due to habitat destruction and climate change. Co author Dr Anastasia Vlasova, of The Ohio State University, said: At this point, we donapost see any reasons to expect another pandemic from this virus. But I canapost say thataposs never going to be a concern. The US team identied the novel canine coronavirus using a molecular diagnostic tool they created last year to detect Covid-.Project leader Professor Gregory Gray, of Duke University, North Carolina, said: How common this virus is, and whether it can be transmitted efficiently from dogs to humans or between humans, nobody knows. What is more important is these coronaviruses are likely spilling over to humans from animals much more frequently than we know. We are missing them because most hospital diagnostic tests only pick up known human coronaviruses. He analysed the archived nasal swabs of  people treated in a hospital in Sarawak in East Malaysia in . Eight of the patients, all but one of them children, were found to have been infected with the new coronavirus - named CCoV-HuPn-. One was just five and a half months old. They all recovered and were discharged after four to six days, following oxygen therapy to help them breathe. Dr Vlasova grew the virus in her lab from one of the clinical specimens - which came from a child. By reconstructing its genome, they were able to confirm the canine coronavirus. It evolved from a coronavirus that afflicts dogs to infect humans - and may contribute to respiratory symptoms. Dr Gray said: There are probably multiple canine coronaviruses circulating and spilling over into humans that we donapost know about. Sarawak could be a rich place to detect them since it is an equatorial area with rich bioersity.  Dr Gray went on: Many of those spillovers are dead ends, they donapost ever leave that first human host. Butwe really want to mitigate the threat, we need better surveillance where humans and animals intersect, and among people who are sick enough to get hospitalised for novel viruses. Diagnostic tools like his have the potential to identy other viruses new to humans before they can cause a pandemic. Dr Gray added: These pathogens donapost just cause a pandemic overnight, it takes many years for them to adapt to the human immune system and cause infection, and then to become efficient in human-to-human transmission. We need to look for these pathogens and detect them early. The researchers plan to further study the CCoV-HuPn- virus to determine how harmful it is - or could become - to people. It is unknownthe virus can be passed from person to person, or how well the human immune system can fight it off. Dr Vlasova said: We donapost really have evidence right now that this virus can cause severe illness in adults. She pointed out only one of the infected patients was an adult. But she said: I cannot rule out the possibility that at some point this new coronavirus will become a prevalent human pathogen. Once a coronavirus is able to infect a human, all bets are off. When a virus alters its genetic makeup enough to go from infecting an animal to people, a combination of factors determine how well it replicates and spreads. It must first enter the human body and recognise something on the surface of the cells, then bind to them. Dr Vlasova said: We know this virus can do that. About half of the genes of the canine coronavirus are similar to those of Covid-. Although only eight cases have been identied, the dog virus or highly similar ones are likely to have circulated much further among dogs and people in Malaysia. Dr Vlasova said: A one-time sampling is not going to tell you with accuracy how prevalent it is. The sampling has to be repeated and done over a period time to see how many people become infected. She added: If you had mentioned this  years ago, that a virus that affects dogs could change to be able to infect people, many would have been sceptical. But it may not be necessary for people to change how they interact with their dogs. Dr Vlasova said: But I would definitely be watching a little more how much I allow my babies around dogs. The virus causes dferent symptoms in dogs, including gastrointestinal problems. Infected people experience a respiratory illness. Dr Gray said: We are likely missing important animal viruses that are beginning to adapt to humans. We need to conduct such virus discovery work among people with pneumonia and also among people who have intense exposure to animals so that we get early warning of a new virus which may become a future pandemic virus. The potential threat posed by the viruses of dogs or cats, which also suffer illnesses from coronaviruses, has not been studied widely. It should be, said Dr Vlasova. Monitoring animal viruses is a way of protecting public health. She added: We primarily put the emphasis on studying emerging disease in humans - not animals. That is a big flaw in the current approach.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnHospitalsImmune systemTherapyAnimalsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"one four think british food","story":"NewsOne in four think British food is boring and even compare it to cardboardA new survey has revealed some unusual snacking habits, with respondents eating beans straight from the tin and dipping gherkins in chocolate spreadmirrorShareCommentsByAdrian Hearn:,  MAY NewsBiscuits are leaving Brits uninspired \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

For decades, the nation has been ridiculed for its beige buffets and stodgy snacks. And now a study of , people has found nearly half feel theyaposre lacking inspiration, particularly when it comes to snacks. Bananas, rich tea biscuits and yoghurt also ranked highly in the monotonous snacks list as  per cent simply eat whatever they can get their hands on - evenit is dull. With snack sessions feeling like Groundhog Day for many, Brits are also crunching on carrots and nibbling rice cakes and popcorn - often compared to chomping on cardboard. What do you think  Have your say in our comment section below...  As a result, some have turned to odd combinations in a bid to waken their taste buds, from dipping digestives in ketchup to munching on Marmite and malt loaves.Others have also ditched the bread in beans on toast - and spoon straight from the tin at snack time. What do you think  Have your say in our comment section below... Other peculiar pairings include dipping gherkins in chocolate spread and squirting salad cream on crisps. A spokesperson from Peperami, which commissioned the research as part of its Ban the Bland campaign, said: A snack should be something people look forward to eating. However, as these results show, thereaposs a worrying lack of flavour hitting the tastebuds of Brits across the nation.

It also emerged nearly a third of adults eat purely for fuel rather than because they enjoy it. Though of those searching for flavour,  per cent find themselves scouring the aisles only to settle for the same old snack they usually tuck into.  Nearly four in  stick to the same old snacks just because theyaposre there - yet nearly one in five said theyaposd happily snack morethey had something interesting to eat. Despite adults snacking across the day, :pm is re with voracious Brits looking for their next fix ahead of dinner time. But respondents described their snacking choices overall as standard, safe or healthy - with  per cent admitting theyaposre in need of some snackspiration. And nearly a quarter have eaten so much bland food recently that their tastebuds have forgotten what flavour is like. There was an also a ide when it came to preferred snacks, with  per cent enjoying savoury and  per cent preferring sweet options. Three quarters admitted they snack even when theyaposre not feeling hungry and will usually reach for a treat when theyaposre bored or watching the telly. When quizzed on what made the perfect snack - flavour was most popular for  per cent, while  per cent said it needed to be something youaposd look forward to eating. Food psychologist, Greg Tucker, said: Playing it safe in snacking is a sensible strategy when the underlying driver is superficial boredom - so the need for stimulation and escape is uppermost. Often we are simply seeking some minor ersion through a measure of predictable pleasure and the well-known reassurance of an old favourite. And when we do discover a new, exciting and stimulating snack then there is a real endorphin rush - a genuine escape, a moment of lasting pleasure and a product added to our repertoire. A spokesperson from Peperami added: We want Brits to take a stand and right the snacking wrongs that have plagued routine for so long. Thereaposs no reason people shouldnapost cast aside their ready salted crisps, of plain rich tea biscuit and enjoy something all-the-more exciting during their day.

Find a hotter iant of a snack you know - either through adding a chilli dip or through a premade hotter iant.. Find a friend. This can be a way to refresh those dreaded Zoom calls or now that we can mix more freely a way to regain some of that social buzz.. Munch faster. Kick start the body by chomping aggressively, make the incisors do the work so the flavour release is more a front of mouth burst and so sht the snacking experience dynamics.. Make it count.

Penny Mills, , was diagnosed with Sanfilippo syndrome two years ago, which has already caused her to forget words she used to know.The condition will eventually take away her ability to walk and to swallow, reports StokeonTrentLive.Friends and family have now rallied to raised thousands of pounds for Penny, which it is hoped will be put towards a holiday. Some of the money has already gone on a wheelchair so the youngster, from Stafford, can go on hikes with her family.

It hadn’t occurred to me we might be told she may not live beyond her teens.” Her initial symptoms included hearing and speech dficulties, repeated nasal infections, diarrhoea and learning delay. Pennyaposs adenoids were removed and she was fitted with grommets, but neither helped her hearing or speech. She was also negatively tested for autism before reaching her true diagnosis. Kelly, who works as a veterinary nurse, added: “I’m very keen to raise awareness of Sanfilippo and other MPS diseases.

If doctors don’t know about them, diagnosis is delayed and children don’t get help as early as possible. “Secondly, some clinical trials are happening around the world into MPS, but they are largely funded by charities. We need more people to know about MPS for it to attract more research funding to help us find a cure for this terrible disease. Kelly and her husband Andrew, , have taken Penny around the world to try to get her into clinical trials, but she wasn’t accepted either time. She has also been supported by the Society for Mucopolysaccharide DiseasesBob Stevens, group chief executive, said: While choosing to shield and take treatment ‘holidays’ has kept many of our young people safe, we know some of our children have suffered from tiredness and pain. While our families have felt isolated, with increased mental and emotional health concerns. We also know that once our families feel confident enough to resume their lives, they will face longer waiting lists for referrals for diagnosis and treatment. That’s why MPS awareness week is very important this year - our families have taken every step to protect themselves and now we want to make sure their quality of le is improved.

His report found that Bashir had lied and deceived his way into securing his explosive chat with Diana, and the internal investigation led by Lord Hall into the matter was woefully ineffective.

The Duke of Sussex was furious at being unable to pay a separate personal tribute to his mother after the inquest in April , with the royal response instead covered by a statement from Prince Charles, claims Duncan Larcombe.Mr Larcombe, author of Prince Harry : The Inside Story, said Harry and William were at a stag do for cousin Peter Phillips on the Isle of Wight just two days later when it became clear Harry was not right.While many factors contributed to the tragic events in Paris, the High Court had concluded the People’s Princess died in an accident.  Writing for the Mirror, Mr Larcombe said: Something was not right with Harry. He was visibly rocking backwards and forwards on his feet. Under his arm was a piece of plastic pipe taped at one end by a large funnel. At one point Harry kneeled down, put the other end of the pipe in his mouth as a pals poured two pints of bitter down his neck. Even by Harry’s standards, this was a young royal drinking to oblivion. Mr Larcombe said Harry told him how he spoke to Harry at , trying to understand what was the matter with him. He added: Harry was furious at the official statement his ‘father’s people’ had issued on his behalf, welcoming the inquest findings.  As far as he was concerned he’d been forced into silence, denied the chance of paying a personal tribute to his beloved mother. When I plucked up the courage to ask him why he had not simply instructed the men in grey suits to issue a statement he was happy with, his answer remains ingrained in my memory. aposBecause they don’t work for me, they work for my father,apos Harry barked back. The author said he can vouch for Harryaposs version of events about what his le was like that he gave to Oprah Winfrey for her new Apple TV+ documentary. He added: Most people thought he was just Harry being Harry, enjoying a drink, a party a good night out.  But in reality, so much of Harry’s infamous hell-raising had a very dferent meaning to the young Royal. Whatever the public’s current view of Harry, the once popular Royal did have to cope with a great deal before he met Meghan. Senior royals are horried by his very public sessions in the psychiatrists chair. But they would do well to remember the role they played in letting their star act suffer in silence for so many years. Can they really blame Harry for wearing his heart on his sleeve, after all that’s the reason he held a special place in the hearts of the public since the age of .  Harry has levelled strong criticisms at the royal family in recent days, following on from previous comments that he had felt trapped. The Duke of Sussex appeared in a new documentary series The Me You Canapost See for Apple TV+ in which he made further damaging allegations against the firm.

She said: I held his hand from pm and talked to him about promises I would keep. At ., the nurses came to change his syringe drivers and they said he was ok. I looked at the clock and I [said] to him aposdarling, it is getting close to the time, itaposs  more minutes [until] I walked down the aisleapos. I reassured him how much I loved him and how much he meant to me.  I told him I will be an old crazy cat lady and how I have adopted three cats already. Then I told him how much I loved him again and I reassured him I would be ok. And then the time came: .pm. He had one big breath, at .pm another one. At .pm, the exact time, six years before, I walked down the aisle, he took his last breath and his colour changed. So I knew it was final. With his last breath he gave me his last reassurance to show the immense love he had for me, he had held on for this signicant day and time as he promised. It was his last promise and he kept it. Steven, was diagnosed with stage four glioblastoma in October .  He had joined the Royal Air Force in  and completed a number of tours including in Iraq. He ed to his Northumberland home and to RAF Boulmer in , following his diagnosis. Rita said that her husband had survived for much longer than doctors had predicted he would, thanks to his strength, spirituality, love of le and love of his family. She said Steven was a beam of light. After Stevenaposs diagnosis, the couple were still able to make precious memories in his final months, including meals with family, walks on the Northumberland coast, and completing the DIY projects he loved. Rita said: He lit up the room with his welcoming smile, booming voice, infectious personality and sense of humour. You would instantly warm to him and he would quickly accept you as part of his wider family.  A very caring, strong and loyal family man, he loved T-shirts and had a fabulous range. Steven would go out of his way to try to help anyone, even through his cancer-fighting days. He always said, aposBehind every dark cloud the sun always shinesapos. His extreme positivity was infectious, even on the darkest of days. She added: His love shines through my everyday le, before and after his death. Steven will also be greatly missed by his family, including parents Alison and Ken Vout, who recalled crying with pride at the passing out ceremony at RAF Halton as he joined the airforce, and how happy his career made him. They said that in Rita he had found the love of his le and that they had never had to worry about him being alone since the pair met.  They said: Steven has been a number one son and we love him forever and [his loss] has left an enormous hole in our hearts. Sharing a tribute on behalf of herself, her husband Kevin, and Stevenaposs nieces and nephews, sister Melissa Barnard recalled how her brother had been caring and creative ever since he was young, and remembered the adventures they would go on as children. She added: Steven had a caring and gentle heart who always thinks of others, mixed with a wicked sense of humour that made his ‘Dad jokes’ legendary, even during the times he was challenged the most by his illness. He never let anything stand in his way of getting what he wanted in le, he was focussed and constantly determined - no more so than in holding on to le for his wedding anniversary. Steven wanted people to realise that we live every day despite any challenges and that every day is beautul. He loved to enjoy a drink or two with friends or family and we have lots of fun memories dancing singing and playing pool, which he was great at. Overall, myself and family will never stop missing him and he will be in our hearts forever. Stevenaposs RAF colleagues are also devastated by his death. Steven and Rita had always been valued members of the Royal Air Force family. Group Captain David Keighley, station commander at RAF Boulmer, said: I am deeply saddened by the news of Sergeant Vout’s passing after many months of illness.  His courageous battle against cancer has given hope and inspiration to countless others across the country. The thoughts of all of us here at RAF Boulmer, and across the wider RAF, are with his family, friends and colleagues at this dficult time. Rita hopes that Stevenaposs story will still continue to inspire people. During his illness, Steven had been determined to share his message of strength and positivity to others living with cancer. She said: Steven’s strength, grace and dignity shone through all his cancer battling journey. He would want you to know everything is possible, stay strong, stay true to yourself and never give up.Stevenaposs loved ones are raising money for St Oswaldaposs Hospice in his memory, and donations can be made here.His funeral will be held at St Bartholomew’s Church, Newbiggin by the Sea, on Friday, June  at .pm followed by a cremation at Blyth Crematorium at .pm. Guests at the service are limited due to Covid- restrictions, but people are invited to line the route from his home to the church, ahead of the ceremony to pay their respects.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnFuneralsCancer"},{"url":null,"title":"student loan system out control","story":"NewsStudent loan system out of control as graduates leave uni with £k to repayEXCLUSIVE: New figures acquired by the Sunday Mirror show .million students have debts totalling to £billion, showing the system is a runaway trainmirrorShareCommentsByJohn SiddleMatthew Davis:,  MAY NewsGrace Dean fears she will never repay her loan \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

At least  graduates owe six-figure sums to the Student Loans Company .And figures acquired by the Sunday Mirror reveal . million students have debts totalling £BILLION .Christopher McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education warned: “The student debt crisis is a runaway train. It is completely out of control. “We need to cut courses by % and restore grants for those who can genuinely benefit from a degree course.” The biggest debt on record is £,, which could be subject to monthly interest of £. Another student owes £, and eight have debts of more than £,. What do you think of this story  Let us know in the comments.  It is believed the £,-plus students have done longer courses, embarked on further education after their initial degree or chosen to restart their higher education. The figures show , students have debts of between £, and £, and , owe £, to £,. Many others will be saddled with a debt of £, to £, after three years – made up of £, tuition fees per year plus borrowing to cover living costs. That can hit £, a year, depending on locality and family circumstances.  Repayments are set at % of anything graduates earn above the annual salary threshold, currently sitting at £,. But interest as high as .% can plunge many into further debt – and % are not expected to clear the loan within  years, at which point it is wiped off. Labour’s shadow universities minister Matt Western said: “This deeply flawed system, combined with the Conservatives’ abolition of the maintenance grant, often leaves the poorest students graduating with the most debt, deterring others from applying to university altogether.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

Now, almost five years after leaving university, her debt stands at £, – up £, due to interest and the fact she is not earning enough to start repaying. Grace, , from Leeds, said: “It’s always in the back of my head how much I owe even though it doesn’t affect getting credit or a mortgage. “I don’t think I’ll ever be able to pay it all back – I’ll never earn enough to clean the slate.” Grace graduated with a PR degree and now works in aviation. She added: “I don’t regret going to university because I met my husband and it shaped my le. “But student debt is enormous and it’s awful so many young people are graduating owing tens of thousands. “For a lot of graduates, the interest they are paying is more than a loan or a credit card.

Their prey include zebras at a starting price of £ for a killing spree and Cape buffalos at £,.Almost all the animals on BookYourHunt are exempt from forthcoming UK legislation aimed at banning the import of hunting souvenirs such as skins, antlers and heads.The website has up to , hunts available for animals such as reindeer , striped hyenas , golden jackalsand the African civet cat . They are not considered sufficiently at risk of extinction to make the Government’s designated categories of species to be covered by the new law. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  But all are on a “red list” compiled by global animal rights body the International Union for the Conservation of Nature which considers them near threatened or vulnerable.Others on the hunt list include camels, kangaroos and even sheep.Eduardo Goncalves, founder of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, said: “This is a click-to-kill catalogue which sick psychos browse before choosing a defenceless animal to shoot for fun. “It’s a one-stop snuff shop for hunters who love to kill for thrills. There’s something for every animal murderer.”  Explorer Ranulph Fiennes said: “This is the most hideous website I have ever heard of. It’s advertising animals like you’re doing a weekly shop, except the photos show bloodthirsty psychopaths grinning moronically over the dead animals they’ve killed for fun. “Trophy imports like these should be banned, they’re an absolute disgrace.” MPs are signing a cross-party Commons motion to press ministers to include less endangered species in the new law – and jail time for offenders. Tory MP David Amess, who is behind the move, said: “We should ensure all animals are protected from those who take pleasure in killing them for entertainment and furnishings. We must settle for nothing less than a total ban.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

Labour environment spokesman Luke Pollard agreed: “If the ban only covers lions and elephants and doesn’t include zebras and other species it will simply displace the cruelty from one species to another.” Campaigners are trying to close another loophole that would allow hunters to import trophies of threatened animals like lions and elephants infor a “conservation exemption” fee. James Reed, north America director of BookYourHunt, condemned the proposed ban for “ignoring the scientically proven benefits trophy hunting provides to animal species”. Mr Reed, whose US firm has offices in Vienna, Budapest, Moscow and Sydney, said: “We strongly support ethical, legal conservation-based hunting”.  Mr Reed claimed that hunting deters human encroachment on animalhabitats and overgrazing by livestock which would “decimate” land.He said: “The loss in revenue from diminished hunting opportunities would increase poaching and cause anti-poaching efforts to cease due to lack of funding by trophy hunting. “On the surface it is easy to let emotions rule when in reality such bans lead to decreased wildle and habitat.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnSunday PeopleAnimalsTrophy Hunting"},{"url":null,"title":"uks youngest lotto winner looks","story":"NewsUKs youngest Lotto winner looks unrecognisable after shaving off her hairCallie Rogers, who was a fresh-faced -year-old when she won a £. million Lotto jackpot, shared a photo of herself with a blonde buzz cut instead of her usual long brunette locksmirrorShareCommentsBySophie RobertsLestyle and Travel EditorChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video britains-youngest-lottery-winner-looks-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:hTMcXZ,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Michael Thomas and Tova Noel have agreed to a plea deal with US prosecutors meaning they will skip prison over convictions for falsying records relating to August . The pair were charged after apparently napping and browsing the internet instead of keeping an eye on the millionaire paedophile throughout their sht, Liverpool Echo reports. According to prosecutors, Thomas looked up sports news and motorcycle sales and Noel shopped online for furniture on the night. Under a deferred prosecution agreement disclosed late on Friday, Noel and Thomas admitted wilfully and knowingly filling in forms saying they conducted regular checks on Epsteinaposs cell.  The bargain, which requires a judgeaposs approval and could be confirmed next week, will see the pair carry out  hoursapos community service and serve six months of supervised release. They must also cooperate fully with the US Justice Departmentaposs probe into the convicted child abuseraposs death. Financier and registered sex offender Epstein, , was found hanging in his cell at the politan Correctional Center in downtown Manhattan on August  . At the time of his death he was being held on remand accused of sex trafficking charges. Epsteinaposs death, which was ruled a suicide by New York Cityaposs top medical examiner, angered then-Attorney General William Barr, and prompted a management overhaul at the Manhattan jail.  Ben Sasse, a senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee and a vocal critic of the governmentaposs handling of the Epstein case, blasted the deal as a joke. In a statement, the Nebraskan Republican said: Epsteinaposs victims have been failed at every single turn. One hundred hours of community service is a joke - this isnapost traffic court. British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, Epsteinaposs longtime associate, has also denied sex trafficking offences and charges that she procured underage girls for Epstein to sexually abuse. Maxwellaposs lawyers have complained that guards in the Brooklyn jail where she is being held on remand regularly shine flashlights into her cell during the night, ostensibly to ensure her safety. They have also said Maxwell, who is expected to go on trial in November, is not a suicide risk and wants her day in court.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnUnited States Department of JusticePrisonsCommunity serviceCrimePoliticsJeffrey Epstein"},{"url":null,"title":"greece packed french tourists who","story":"NewsGreece packed with French tourists who get free Covid tests while Brits must payCritics have called on the British government to offer free PCR tests to travellers like the French government do, but Health Secretary Matt Hancock has previously said people should not travel to amber countries on holiday at allmirrorShareCommentsByDave BurkeNews reporter:,  MAY News\" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _GREECE-HEALTH-VIRUS-TOURISM-TRAVEL-ECONOMY.jpg\"Greek holiday spots are reportedly packed with French tourists who are entitled to free PCR tests\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Under current regulations, people travelling from the UK to amber list countries are required to take four tests, racking up a bill of £ on top of their travel and accommodation costs. Critics say this needs to change, although ministers have said people are not advised to travel to these countries at all unless it is essential. Greece is one of many European tourist hotspots, including France, Spain and Italy, on the amber list - meaning people must quarantine at home on theiror face fines of up to £,. Although travelling there is legal, the government has said people should not do it in a week of confused messaging. The French government is providing free tests to people travelling abroad, and the Mail on Sunday reports that the Greek island of Snos is flooded with tourists as a result.Former British Airways boss Willie Walsh said the PCR tests should be free for UK travellers. He said: ‘The tests are being mandated for health reasons, therefore they should be provided free of charge by the health authorities.’ And the former airline chief fumed: All you have to look at is the number of people who have gone into the PCR testing business in the last few months. It’s clear that people see this as an opportunity to profit from a health crisis.  During a Downing Street press briefing this week, Mr Hancock said people should not be going to amber list countries at the moment. He said: We have been absolutely crystal clear that you should not go to an amber or red list country on holiday, you should only go in exceptional circumstances. I think we have been really clear throughout this pandemic that there are some things we have banned in law but there are some things that we do not recommend, but you donapost necessarily have to ban everything. As a government minister,you donapost advise it and you think it isnapost the right thing to do, you donapost necessarily ban it - there are many examples of that. What we do know is that the public have been brilliant at exercising the personal responsibility that we are seeking.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"young girl suddenly loses hair","story":"NewsYoung girl suddenly loses hair after catching infection from familys new catThe girls condition, which has been identied as scalp ringworm causing a large bald spot on the top of her head, sadly developed just a week after an adorable new addition to the familymirrorShareCommentsByNina LloydFreelance reporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe girl may need to continue shaving the bald spot until the infection clears \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

When the youngster was given the seemingly harmless new pet by her parents, they could never have guessed that in just a weekaposs time she would develop a huge bald patch. But according to the news site Toutiao, the cat infected the girl with tinea capitis - a fungal infection of the scalp also known as scalp ringworm. The condition can be caught by coming into close contact with an infected animal or person. The family, from Shenzhen city in the south-eastern Chinese province of Guangdong, have now sought treatment from a doctor.  They had to take the girl to a salon to have the affected area shaved to give the infection a chance to heal and may need to continue doing so. Symptoms of tinea capitis include hair loss, redness, itchiness, and dry scaly areas - but the youngster appears to have a sense of humour about the situation. In a clip circulating online the girl can be seen lowering her head and pouting jokily while displaying the patch for the camera. She scowls and takes a sip of smoothie before performing a mock angry walk away. Fortunately, tinea capitis can usually be treated with an antungal medicine. In the UK, pharmacists can help with cream, gel or spray that typically clears the rash up in around four weeks.

Max Anderson was the man to drop to the bench.Marshall, meanwhile, was only fit enough for a place on the bench after five weeks out. He was joined by striker Jason Cummings as a substitute with Danny Mullen leading the line.The dangermen started for the Premiership side with Chris Burke looking to provide service for striker Kyle Lafferty.A huge roar erupted from the  home fans as Dundee kicked off, shooting towards the empty Bob Shankly Stand in the first half.The rain was teaming down with a chill wind but there was no dampening of voices at the other end.They were up again seconds into the contest as Shaun Byrne crunched into Greg Kiltie in midfield.The real roar came on six minutes, though, as Dundee got off to the perfect start.And it was that man McGhee with another key play-off goal.Charlie Adam found time in the middle to chip perfectly over the defence for the run of Cammy Kerr.With his left-foot the full-back sent the ball in first time to find the head of Mullen.Colin Doyle got to it but could only push the ball onto the post. Following in was McGhee, however, and he got his reward with a tap-in on the line.And it could easily have been - inside  minutes as Paul McMullan found himself through on goal.He took his time but couldn#t beat Doyle from the angle.On the quarter-hour mark Killie threatened for the first time as Lafferty ran the channel in behind Fontaine before curling an effort well wide.As the conditions worsened, the visitors began to work the ball and work the Dundee defence.They weren#t getting much change out of the Dark Blues players charged up by the boisterous  in the stand, though.The contest meandered towards half-time with neither side able to create much on the slippy pitch and howling wind.Kilmarnock boss Tommy Wright wasn#t happy with his side#s performance, either, giving the dugout a good whack and his players an earful.Four minutes before the break Dundee did create a look at goal and, once more, McGhee was the man.Mullen did well to get down the left flank before cutting back for the midfielder. McGhee#s effort, though, was deflected into the side-netting.A quick start to the first half was followed by a fast start to the second.Dundee shooting towards the home fans, the script was written for only one man.Harassing play from Christie Elliott saw McMullan pinch the ball off Gary Dicker and cut the ball back.Playing in front of a home crowd for the first time, lelong Dee Adam was on hand to fire the Dark Blues - ahead.And his celebration in front of the cheering fans showed just how much that meant.After  months away it wouldn#t take much to get the Dundee fans behind their team.Their team, though, was responding to every shout, every bit of encouragement from the -strong support.On  minutes it was almost - as Killie let possession slip once more, allowing Mullen to run into the area.His effort was well-struck but Doyle was equal to it with a good stop.With  minutes remaining, Killie got their leline.There was an element of luck about it as a combination of Mullen and Kerr blocked Haunstrup#s first effort.The ball, though, dropped perfectly for the full-back to slot through the legs of Adam Legzdins.And it was almost level just moments later as Legzdins had to be sharp to beat the ball out at his front post.The nerves were obvious from the support every time Kilmarnock ventured forward in the closing stages.There was still plenty going the other way, too, but there would be no more scoring.That leaves Dundee just one game away from promotion back to the top flight, heading to Rugby Park on Monday with a - lead.Dundee: Legzdins, Elliott , Fontaine, Ashcroft,

really grateful.# #I’m absolutely buzzing.# #Just delighted.# #You don’t really appreciate it until it’s gone.# #There’s a real buzz around the place.#Dundee fans have waited  days to be allowed back into their Dens Park temple to cheer on their dark blue favourites.The day has finally come for  supporters lucky enough to have had their names plucked out of the hat toto their own hallowed ground.And it’s not just for any old game either # the last home match of the season is the first leg of the Premiership play-off final.Ato the top table of Scottish football is at stake. Kilmarnock are in the way.Whatever the result, Dundee supporters with the golden tickets are just grateful to be back.And they are ready to make their voices heard.“I don’t think I’ve ever answered a call as quick as I did once it started ringing!” says Sean Ferguson, a diehard who hadn’t missed a game, home or away, including pre-season trips, for seven-and-a-half years before the pandemic.“I couldn’t stop smiling. We’ve been hoping and praying all year to get in at some point and it was just a great feeling to be lucky enough to receive the call, I’m really grateful for it.“It’s been really dficult not getting into Dens to see them every week. It really has been hard because watching my team every Saturday is an escape.“It will mean so much to me getting to be there on Thursday. I honestly can’t wait.”mdash sean fergusonMay , Russell Hutchison has been going to Dens since  and a season ticket holder, on and off, for the past  years.“I got the phone call on Monday and, to be honest, I thought I had missed out after not hearing on Sunday,” he said.“I’m just delighted to have been lucky enough to come out of the ballot.“It’s the luck of the draw and I’m thoroughly looking forward to getting back to Dens and getting my bum back on a plastic seat.“There will be no pub, though – I usually go with four mates and I’m the only one to get a ticket.“That’s the big thing I’ve missed, the social aspect of it.”mdash Scott McruvieMay , Ross Day, meanwhile, is normally located in the South Enclosure on a matchday.He’ll be joining the other  lucky souls in the Bobby Cox Stand from an hour-and-a-quarter before kick-off.“I’m absolutely buzzing to get a ticket,” he said.“It’s like getting a ticket for a cup final.“No matter the game,it was a friendly against Brechin, you couldn’t keep me away.“I’ve missed going to Dens big time.“You don’t really appreciate how important it is until it’s gone.“It’s only maybe a couple of hours a week but it’s my time where I can do what I want, let out some frustration.“It’s just not the same on TV, you find your attention wavers and you end up looking at your phone. There’s nowhere near the same engagement as actually being there.“I can’t wait.”Ross has been hard at work over the past year or so setting up the  Foundation for fans to help support the club.For Saturday#s play-off second leg against Raith Rovers, with fans still unable to attend due to coronavirus restrictions, the Foundation sold virtual tickets.The aim was to ‘sell out’ the almost ,-capacity ground with proceeds going directly to the club.• Virtual ticket raised just under k• Now over  members • Over £, a month donated to @DundeeFC from the fans• On course to top £, in their first yearJoin here 👇🏻https:t.co yTAtevSEbmdash The Dee ArchiveMay , He admits that was a tall order but he’s delighted with the money raised to top up their overall tally to more than £, for the past season.“We were just shy of , tickets sold which is around about what we managed the last time,” he added.“Ideally we wanted a sell-out but we’re happy with the end result.“We raised about £, from the game on Saturday and that brings us to around £, for the entire season.“That’s phenomenal really in our first year.“We have around  members now and we hope to see some  Foundation scarves on show for the first time tonight!”The big question, though, is how the match might pan out tonight at Dens Park.Kilmarnock are the big favourites, being the Premiership team, but Dundee have been in good form of late.Ross said: “I’ll take a draw. Going to Rugby Park for a one-off game might suit us.“With these games you go in with more hope than expectation, to be honest.”mdash Dundee Football ClubMay , Russell, meanwhile, has a similar view: “We’ve been playing well and we’ve got goals in us but I’m not bullish.“I think we’ll score but the main thing is the tie is still alive for the second leg.”And Sean adds: “I think it’s all about the first leg,we can go to Kilmarnock on Monday night with either a draw or a win we give ourselves a great chance.“It won’t be easy keeping Kyle Lafferty quiet but we have good players in our team as well, let’s hope the fans can get right behind them and cheer them on to win.“It would mean so much to the club and fans.“With there being no fans in this year the relationship has gotten closer with the club and the fans setting up the  foundation and things like that.“I feel there’s a buzz around the place.”EXCLUSIVE: Dundee stalwart Paul McGowan opens up on making  appearances #

This year they’ve moved it to May to take advantage of the supposedly better weather in the northern hemisphere, but that’s debatable.#The rides have been running for  years, so this is actually the th anniversary of it happening. It#s been in Aberdeen since , I took over the hosting of the ride in . Since we’ve been doing it we’ve raised about £-,, just the Aberdeen one alone.#Globally, the Distinguished Gentleman’s Ride has taken in around million since it started, and it’s definitely the biggest motorcycle charity event that takes place.#After the disappointment of the  event being cancelled due to covid, this year#s ride was organised at the last minute when restrictions changed on May .The riders normally have a celebration at the end of the ride and this year they will go to the Buchanan Bistro in Banchory. He said: #They’re quite happy to host the riders coming in and they’ve actually provided a complimentary lunch for us as well which is absolutely fantastic and super generous of them.#So, the first  riders that have registered and fundraised are all getting a complementary lunch at the bistro.#Other local businesses have been showing their support for the dapper chaps. Shirlaws Motorcycles are providing a brand new helmet and other motorcycling clothes as prizes for the four riders who raise the most money.Additionally, Rugged Miles have donated items for the most dapper rider which will be judged tomorrow. Mr Webster describes it as a #bit of fun to keep the guys interested and inspire them to go out and raise a bit more money for the charity.#The route will go through Aberdeen and has only been shared with the registered riders for safety reasons, however, Mr Webster did say they will be riding along Union Street.#If there#s anyone on Union Street who#d like to give us a wave we#ll be heading up past there a little after am and we will give you a toot and a gentlemanly tip of the hat as well.#The group of gentleman will finish at the Buchanan Bistro at around pm where they will stay for a couple of hours.

It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began.After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus.The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement.

Carried out in a dferent way during daytime, physically spread out, limited attendees, socially distanced and cordoned off behind plastic.Everyone behind the planning of the election in Argyll and Bute deserves a huge pat on the back.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And then there#s the goats.Leaving the harbour car park, turn right and follow the road back up the hill for m.You will pass two minor roads on your right, the turning to Port Righ on your left.Continue until the school is on your left and immediately look for a forestry road to your right .Turn right on to the track, keeping the car park to your left. Ignore a small path to your right and continue to a T-junction.Turn rightpast the village playing fields, with woods to your left. After m, turn left at a fork in the track into the woodland .The track meets the other route just ahead. Veering left your path climbs noticeably over the next .km, through plantations, past the reservoir off to the right # worth a small detour # until arriving at a junction.The Kintyre Way continues north whereas your path heads sharply left to continue up the hill.The next section opens out and is a lovely part of the walk, with excellent views back to Arran.After a few minutes, and as the path heads south on the higher section, look for the path to the summit on your right.It is now a very short hop to the summit Trig pointfor some lovely views right down Kintyre and towards Ailsa Craig.Although known as Deer Hill, Cnoc an Ghabar translates as Goat Hill I suspect there will be an explanation!Return to the path, meandering southwards for .km, with the odd little up and plenty of steep downs, passing back into the woodland where it meets another track.Turn left and look out for the path right just over m ahead. Follow this down through the dark woods.After m look for the path and steps heading right. Take these to the Network Centre, which,open, is a good place to stop for a well-deserved cuppa.Exiting the Network Centre, carefully cross the road, heading left towards a track opposite signposted to Carradale Bay Caravan Park. Follow this briefly before turning right onto Sally’s Walk.After a minute or so look for a turning left signposted ‘Carradale East Services’ and take it. After m you will re-join the main track but will soon take the turning right heading south to ‘Carradale Bay’.En route you will see the stepping stones that cross over Carradale Water to Waterfoot # I don’t recommend standing on them as they can be very slippery.Continue by the river, passing through gorse and a gate, before finally reaching a sharp left-hand bend.Head straight on via the little path to the beach. You can now enjoy the vast open expanse of sand as you head eastwards across the lovely Carradale Bay.When you reach the far end of the bay, over km away, veer right to a gate by a ruin.Passing through the gate a small path now meanders up through gorse and bracken heading south towards Carradale Point.It is worth keeping to the higher ground on the way out as the path drops down through interesting rocks near its end with some grand views.This is also a great vantage point from which to see the area’s feral goats,about.At the end you can cross to the vitried fort on the islet unless there are very high spring tides.To , take the lower path* up the western side just above the shoreline # a mass of wildflowers in early summer. This also allows closer inspection of the amazing folded Dalradian rocks.Once back at the bay # where you may decide a swim is in order # head right up the track from the carpark at its eastern end.After a gate you will be in fields which may have livestock. Veer sharp left at the other side of the first field and follow the track to another gate out on to a lane.Head straight ahead toto Carradale village and the main road. Right will take you back down to the harbour and past potential refreshments.*You can also follow part of the coast or go over the top to Port Righand along the edge of the golf course via Airds Castle ruins before dropping back down to Carradale harbour.

With their strong Gaelic and Norse heritage they defied the will of kings, and their political influence was undeniable.This independence of spirit might account, in part at least, for a modern-day habit of Islay folk # to enter the world of politics.With the election earlier this month of Jenni Minto as constituency MSP, the island now has three serving Argyll and Bute politicians, with council leader Councillor Robin Currie and Councillor Alastair Redman.Orkney and Shetland LibDem MP Alistair Carmichael, another Ileach, can be added to the list # and there may be more out there.Then there is George Robertson # now Lord Robertson of Port Ellen # former Labour politician and Secretary General of NATO, and the much-respected late Labour leader John Smith, both of whom have Islay connections.All of the above from an island of little more than , people.The Argyllshire Advertiser decided to ask the politicians themselves for their theories about why Islay has the habit of producing a preponderance of politicians.Leader of Argyll and Bute Council Robin Currie explained: #Ileachs are known for their sense of community, their enthusiasm for their island and their culture, and their erse mix of skills and resilience # so it#s no surprise that so many of us want to take that a stage further by representing not only our own island but the whole of Argyll and Bute, or indeed the country itself, as is the case with George Robertson and the late John Smith.#All of these characteristics will stand anyone in good stead when it comes to le as an elected representative, whether that’s at local or national government level.#It#s great that [in Argyll and Bute] we have a good balance of elected representatives of all political flavours, who understand the needs and characteristics of that mix of communities, and who can bring that knowledge together to work on issues of strategic as well as local importance.#Councillor Currie added: #It goes without saying that I wish my fellow Ileach, Jenni Minto, every success in her new role and I look forward to working with her.#Conservative Alastair Redman # one of three councillors serving Kintyre and the Isles alongside Councillor Currieand Tarbert#s Anne Horn# pointed to Islay#s #unique economy and location# as part of the reason for its political prominence.#Islay is both rural and at the same time heavily industrialised with our large number of distilleries,# he said.#It might be considered isolated yet is a global trading powerhouse. We on Islay have a population of just a few thousand yet our name is world famous.#There is also our history which to a degree separates us from mainland Scotland. Finlaggan was the seat of the Lords of the Isles under Clan Donald with roots that go back beyond the Kingdom of Scotland, beginning with Somerled in the th century.#I feel that this has led to Ileachs being more independent and perhaps at times more forthright than others.#I hope that many more councillors, MSPs, MPs, cabinet ministers, lords and even prime ministers will come from my home island which, though small, has made a huge mark on this world.#The last word goes to the newest member of Islay#s political gang, Jenni Minto MSP.The SNP member also cited the island#s past influence on Scottish politics through Finlaggan and the Lordship of the Isles.And she highlighted more examples of single-minded Ileachs making their mark on the world.#In - three ships with Islay people on board sailed for the New York colony,# said Ms Minto.#On one of these was five-year-old Alexander McDougall, who became a key figure in America’s war for independence. He had a very successful le, rising to the rank of Major General in the continental army. He then entered public service and was elected to the New York state senate. On his death he was described by George Washington as one of the five pillars of the American revolution.##I am not Islay-born,# she continued, #but feel very lucky to live on such a wonderful island. I often describe it as the centre of the universe, and there are very few places you can visit without meeting someone from Islay or someone who has a connection with the island.#I think that coming from, or living on, an island you need a level of resilience and creativity but you also have a true sense of community and working together.#Islay is also known to be a friendly place, where everyone has time to chat and listen to other people’s thoughts and views.#I think all of these traits are needed in politics and so perhaps it is not a surprise that Islay people have entered public service.#PICS:Jenni Minto MSP. no_aScotElection_McglynnArgyll and Bute Council leader, Robin Currie. aelectionCurrienoCouncillor Alastair Redman.

However, there now seems to be an acceptance in Transport Scotland that a new solution has to be found.In a letter to the press, George Allan points out that the -mile route from Strathlachlan to Colintraive and the eight miles between Ormidale and Tighnabruaich were designed and constructed in  or  years.I was a member of the survey and design team on these routes. I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.Philip Shimmin, Inverness.Sir,I would like to say thank you to all the lads who have been working at the Crinan Canal # often when the north winds were blowing and water was pouring down from the hills into the empty canal more quickly than the pumps were able to remove it.The men greeted me each morning as I walked past to go over the temporary bridge. They were trying to renew the basement concrete which supports the new bridges in spite of the wet, cold weather.Fortunately, April was drier and they managed to fit the new gates thanks to the massive cranes and the skill of the lorry drivers carrying these heavy loads to and from the canal.Others have cleared the rubbish, including lots of old car tyres, which had been dumped.It is good to see the canal filled and in working order again.J Thorgrimsson, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"reduce farm costs save time and make life easier","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

With the evenings getting longer and brighter you can use your garden or patio as a great extension to your home and just sit back and relax.It’s at this time of year that lawns need to be mowed more frequently, so here are some key pointers on getting that perfect cared-for look.Mow at least once a week and raise the mower blades when it’s very hot weather. Don’t mow when grass is wet or during a drought and don’t collect your clippings during dry spells as this helps conserve moisture.Keep watering throughout the summer unless there is a water shortage and repair bare patches with turf or re-seeding.This is also the month to ensure that all your plants are adequately fed, particularly those in baskets and tubs.Plants benefit from a regular feeding programme as they are growing vigorously and need their nutrition levels to be kept up. Slow-release granules are a good idea for pots and baskets because they last for about six months and release food as it is required into the compost.Not often thought of as a container plant, but an excellent option for small gardens, is a rose.A simple solution for June is to create an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.Just buy a selection of dferent sized pots, plant them with a ieties of roses and then place them together in a group.There is a rose for every garden situation. From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew. Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and midsummer day arrives, here are few ‘must do’ jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"julie-forrest-loses-open-singles-world-bowls-competition","story":"BORDERS bowler Julie Forrest has been knocked out of the open singles at the World Indoor Bowls Championships .Forrest lost her last- match todayagainst Englandrsquos Greg Harlow, the competitionrsquos sixth seed.Forrest, from Hawick, shared the opening set -, but she was defeated -

Irsquove always been happy with my online job and content creation, but when I went for a meeting with the team, I just loved them ndash they were so passionate about the show, and I just thought lsquookay, letrsquos try it out!rsquoThe popular home show continues to attract a strong following in its third series,Spiers believes demand will be at an all-time high. ldquoI think itrsquos a really great programme to go on after so long in lockdown, she highlights.ldquoWhen everyonersquos been looking at the same four walls for the last year, lots of people have big plans for what theyrsquore going to do with their homes, and for when they can have tradesmen back into the house, so I think watching an interiors show is going to be inspiring for people hellip a welcome bit of voyeurism.Despite the fluctuating restrictions of the pandemic last year, the crew, alongside Spiersrsquos fellow judges interior designer Anna Campbell-Jones and architect Michael Angus, were able to film series three last September.ldquoI would not recommend filming during a pandemic, laughs Spiers. ldquoWe would do Covid tests every couple of days, get temperature checks twice a day ndash we constantly had thermometers hanging out of our mouths.ldquoWe were really lucky we could get out to film, and it was great to see more of Scotland.Originally from New Zealand, Spiers considers herself an honorary Scot since moving here as a child. The content creator has a weighty , followers on Instagram, many of whom were gained over the last year alone. ldquoMy following grew massively during the pandemic, she explains, ldquowhereas it hadnrsquot grown that much in the last couple of years.One of the main reasons for this influx is Spiersrsquos dreamy, aesthetically pleasing interiors.ldquoI would think my niche, or my USP, is probably that I live quite a simple le ndash I view my content as being attainable but slightly aspirational.ldquoMy husband and I live in a three-bedroom tenement flat in the southside of Glasgow ndash itrsquos far from a mansion, but it has period detailing and wersquove done a lot of work to make it our own and inject our personality into it. Itrsquos also a style that is easy to replicate.ldquoIrsquom quite inspired by Southern Calornian style ndash lots of wood and greenery, earthy tones, and textures. I bring a lot of that into my home, I love rattan and a bit of s style. I think Irsquove created quite a colourful home that brings me a lot of joy.So, after being able to add TV presenter to her ever-growing CV, whatrsquos next for Spiers  ldquoWriting is my passion, she emphasises. ldquoI would love to write a book one day, a collection of essays, I think ndash thatrsquos something Irsquove always been leading up to. Although everybody always wants me to do an interiors book!Kate shares her top tips to freshen up your home for springThere is no better time to refresh your home than the start of a new season, and the arrival of spring definitely brings with it a chance to declutter and revive your space. So, throw open your windows, stock up on blossom-scented cleaning supplies and follow my steps for freshening up your home for spring hellipDeep clean and declutter:Spring is the perfect time to assess your home and see what you can donate or throw out. Irsquove made multiple trips to the recycling centre lately and it really has made a dference to my home ndash I know Irsquoll never be a minimalist, but it feels calming to have a little less clutter at least.Set aside an hour or so once a week to clear out your wardrobe, kitchencabinets and hallway cupboards.Reorganise sideboards and shelves, and get rid of anything you havenrsquot used or worn in a while ndash be ruthless! Then give everything a once-over as you go ndash spring cleaning is good for the soul.Have a room refresh:Changing the layout of a room and giving your home a bit of a rejig does wonders for making the space feel like new. Once or twice a year Irsquoll consider how I can switch up my spaces. Irsquoll move furniture, swap out soft furnishings, relocate the sofa to another position or change our spare room completely. Irsquoll even rework the gallery walls and artwork around my home. Itrsquos like redecorating but without spending a penny.Bring the outdoors:in Stock up on tulips, daffodils and peonies, and place bouquets around your home ndash on mantelpieces, sideboards, kitchen worktops and coffee tables. Irsquom a big fan ofgreenery in the home too ndash plants like Pothos, Monstera deliciosa and ZZ plants are so easy to take care of and really breathe a bit of le into a room. Irsquom all about the indoor jungle, so go wild with blooms and plants and your home will feel bright and breezy in no time.Consider a lick of paint:With so many fun paint brands launching lately , itrsquos easier than ever to add colour to your le. Opt for a fresh eucalyptus green to revive a bathroom, or pick a played-down pink for warmth. Go wild with it ndash paint a feature wall in your living room or section off a room with a dado rail and paint the lower section a bright shade. Bold colours never go out of style.www.katelavie"},{"url":null,"title":"10-best-museums-galleries-edinburgh-glasgow","story":"Kelvingrove Art Gallery And Museum, Kelvingrove, GlasgowOne of the gems in Glasgowrsquos art crown, Kelvingrove re-opens on Monday giving punters the chance to enjoy its world-beating collection.

Itrsquos normal to find this a bit uncomfortable.Using the same swab, insert it up your nostril until you feel resistance.Rotate the swab in your nostril  times.Pick up the extraction tube, open the lid and place the fabric tip of the swab in the fluid in the tube.Firmly press the swab against the bottom-inside of the tube and rotate it around for  seconds. Itrsquos important to mix thoroughly.Pinch the tube as you remove the swab and put the nozzle cap on.Squeeze the extraction tube to place two drops of fluid on the test strip.

which is more sensitive - to confirm the result before making a final decision on cancelling your visit.\"This is potentially an important way in which we can minimise the risk, of bringing Covid into island communities while nevertheless allowing our island communities the benefit of opening up again to visitors.\"Soyou are planning on travelling to an island over the course of next week, it is possible to get tests from today, and I would encourage you to do that.\""},{"url":null,"title":"times-league-table-borders-high-schools-appear-top-50","story":"A LEAGUE table of Scottish secondary schools has been published by The Timesndash and the Borders has two in the top .The newspaper creates rankings every year based on the proportion of pupils achieving five or more Highers.This years editionwas published in print on Wednesday, May , showing a total of  schools in the country.GalashielsAcademy has risen by more than  places compared with last years chart.The Elm Row school is now in th place ndash up from last yearrsquos finish of th, as reported in the print edition of The Times.: Talented executive director is leaving Scottish Borders Council for new jobAccording to the latest statistics,  per cent of Gala Academy pupils achieved five or more Highers in .That is up on , which saw  per cent of Gala pupils complete the feat.In this yearrsquos table, only Earlston High Schooland Peebles High Schoolfinished above Gala Academy among the high schools in the Borders.Sixty-seven per cent of pupils at Earlston managed five or more Highers in , an increase of  per cent on rsquos figure .Meanwhile,  per cent of Peebles High pupils achieved five or more Highers last year, up from  per cent in .: Historic mansion near Borders saved from demolition following outcry over plansThe other Borders schools named in the rankings were Jedburgh Grammar School , Selkirk High School , Berwickshire High School , Kelso High School , Eyemouth High Schooland Hawick High School .As a region, the Borders council area was th in a league table of Scottish councils after . per cent of pupils graduated with five or more Highers.That is a . per cent increase on rsquos figure .A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \"There is a lot of good work going on right across the nine high schools in the Borders and it should be noted that there are a number of dferent ways of measuring the health and success of a school.\"The top performing school in the latest table based on this metric was Jordanhill School, Glasgow, which recorded an  per cent success rate of pupils recording five or more Highers.The lowest performing school was Craigroyston Community High School, Edinburgh, which recorded nine per cent of pupils achieving the feat."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-vaccine-passport-scheme-announced-scotland","story":"A new scheme that will allow Scots to prove they have been vaccinated against coronavirus before travelling abroad has been launched by the Scottish Government.Those who have been vaccinated can download a letter from the NHS Inform patient website, or request a letter from the Covid Status Helplinethey are not online.But as details of the vaccination status scheme were announced, Scotlandrsquos Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith urged people to be \"highly cautious about international travel\"and ldquocontinue to limit their travel abroad.Only those travelling to a country where proof of vaccination is needed as an entry requirement should request a letter.There are currently no countries that require travellers to show their vaccination status, but the letter scheme is being introduced because international travel requirements can change quickly during the pandemic.What to do before going abroad:If yoursquore planning to travel abroad, you must:check whether a country yoursquore travelling to is on the red, amber or green listconfirm what you need to do when you arrive back in ScotlandCountries may move between the green, amber and red lists at short notice.You should not assume that a country on the green, amber or red list now will remain on the same list over the weeks and months ahead.Before you travelYoull also need to:have taken a coronavirus testin the threedays before you begin your journey to Scotland -

Eight designs will be chosen to become stamps which will be on sale across the UK.Children may choose to illustrate frontline workers in health or social care.They may want to celebrate other key workers who have kept the country going, such as refuse collectors, cleaners, teachers, supermarket workers, public transport staff, delivery drivers or, indeed, postmen and postwomen.Or they might highlight the volunteers who have helped in their local communities or raised money for charity, such as the late Captain Sir Tom Moore.The competition is open until Friday May . A special  of judges will select the winners. As with all special stamps, the final eight designs will be sent to HM The Queen before they can be printed and issued as stamps.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We decided this is something we can do safely, while also making the community smile, just like the previous flock did, eight whole years ago.#Please get in touchyou would like further details.#To find out how to get involved with the latest #flamingo flocking# campaign, email Agnes Stewart on Ags@yahoo, telephone   or contact the @CGSGambia Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The shutdown means the loss of nine jobs at the plant, but local farmers believe the knock-on effect on employment will be even worse.Farmer and shareholder in the company Tony Archibald said: #It could mean the loss of another job on every dairy farm, not to mention the milk tanker driver.#The farmers are looking at ways of opening the creamery. It is very important because it is the one thing we have as a raw material for over here.#The farmers were due to meet as the Courier went to press to discuss ways of re-opening the creamery and they also plan to meet representatives of Scottish Milk.Mr Coffield described the closure as #devastating#. He said: #There#s not a lot of work round here. The main feeling about the place is disbelief.#The creamery produced about  tonnes of cheese a year.FIFTY YEARS AGOColour TV comes to CampbeltownColour television is to be launched in Campbeltown next Tuesday by Redfusion.And to mark the occasion, Redfusion is staging a demonstration exhibition in the town#s White Hart Hotel, where about six sets will be on view.The exhibition will be open to the public for three days.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The live action and CGI film tells of Peter#s latest adventures, this time out of the garden, where he finds himself in a world where mischief is appreciated, but soon his family comes to bring him home.Also hitting the big screen when the cinema reopens is the new part-live action and part-animated Tom and Jerry – the latest tale of the renowned mayhem-causing cat and mouse – and action-smash-fest Godzilla vs. Kong, a sequel to Godzilla: King of the Monsters and Kong: Skull Island.Coming in the next few weeks will be Nomadland, Minari, The Father, and A Quiet Place II.Alongside the newer films, the cinema has also rescheduled its #Thirty Films to See Before You#re Thirty# season, kicking off with Trainspotting and The Goonies.Ellen added: #Along with social distancing please ensure to wear your mask at all times in the building, except when eating and drinking in your cinema seat.#"},{"url":null,"title":"inez picks up prizes amid winning streak","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was really pleased to find a company that does dehydrated vegan food in compostable bags, so I bought  meals and have mailed them in batches to post offices around the country so I can collect them as I travel.#As far as training for such an extraordinary expedition is concerned, Ben explained that he has participated in several endurance events, including multi-day running, in the past, but, now three weeks since he left his starting point of Glasgow he is enjoying this trip more than these previous competitions.#I’m loving this as it’s not all ‘Go, Go , Go’. I want to be able to sit back and take time and explore all the dferent parts of the coast. This trip has given me time to write, which is something I’ve wanted to do for a while.#Ben’s blog can be read on his website where he has also written in detail about the threat plastic litter poses to marine le and the environment in general.#I wasn’t brought up by the sea I’m from Manchester,# Ben adds. #I worked at a youth hostel in Ullapool for a couple of years and felt a connection there.#When I’m picking up rubbish on beaches I feel really up and down about it all.#I feel so sad about what I find, and also about the amount that’s below the ocean’s surface. But then I realise I need to do what I can.#On that note, Ben is keen to work together with locals who want to make a dference.He is helping out at a beach clean in Oban this Friday, May . Information on this and how to donate to the John Muir Trust or the Marine Conservation Society can be found on Ben’s www.ukcoastjourney website."},{"url":null,"title":"new member makes his mark at dunaverty","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance. Anyone who feels they are able to help can contact Campbell Robertson, club secretary.For more club updates, follow @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"budding young photographers make their mark","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Known only to the world mysteriously as #Pat#, he decided to part with his , bottle library last year, through a series of auctions, with a mission to share his passion for whisky with the world by passing his bottles on to new owners.Joe Wilson, head of auction content at Whisky Auctioneer, said: #Fèis Ìle is an iconic celebration of whisky and Islay culture that draws people back to the island year after year.#From Port Ellen to Bowmore and Bruichladdich to Ardbeg, this collection of Fèis Ìle bottlings is without a doubt the largest and most complete we have ever encountered.#The auction presents the rare opportunity for collectors and whisky drinkers to acquire some incredibly scarce malts that have been produced to celebrate the history of this iconic whisky region.#Examples from each of Islay#s eight single-malt producing distilleries feature in the sale, including complete collections of every single limited edition festival bottling from distilleries including Bowmore, Laphroaig and Lagavulin.The sale also features bottles that have been donated to the Fèis Ìle committee by distilleries to raise charitable funds for the island through their Islay Wave Project, which will focus on ways to support culture, artists and youth.Included in the charity lots is the oldest and rarest release directly from the iconic Islay distillery, Port Ellen. The Port Ellen -year-old # Rogue Casks# is the second release in the #Untold Stories# series, which explores the intriguing history of the Islay distillery ahead of its re-opening after closure almost three decades ago.Florence Grey, chairperson of the Fèis Ìle committee, said: #Fèis Ìle was delighted to be given the bottles in this charity auction from Diageo, plus a signed bottle from the legendary Islay whisky maker Jim McEwan.#All the proceeds raised from these bottles will benefit our island community as the funds will kickstart our Islay Wave Project # an ongoing project that will begin after this year#s virtual festival.#Focusing on ways to support our island#s culture, artists and youth, The Islay Wave Project concentrates on everything we celebrate throughout Fèis Ìle.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura. Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen. It is not intended, of course, to confine the benefits of the scheme to miners or their dependents.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in. But our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.The uncertainty during the Covid lockdown over access to basic shopping and medication, a lack of information in accessible formats, the social isolation, the barriers to being guided because of social distancing # these have all added to and compounded the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.But we want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.To contact the Need to Talk service, phone the RNIB Helpline on    or email needtotalk@rnib.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons.

When inflammation becomes chronic and long-lasting though, it can have a negative effect on our health, contributing to diseases like heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes.Diet is just one key way that we can help to control chronic inflammation in the body - and while sugary and processed foods can worsen the problem, these superfoods may help to keep it in check..

These disease-fighting molecules help to protect your body against free radicals unstable atoms that can damage cells, causing illness and aging.All berries contain flavonoids, but certain ieties are more potent than others. Blackberries are known for their high content of the phytonutrient, which has powerful anti-inflammatory properties, and can play a role in supporting the immune system too.If you cant afford to buy fresh punnets of berries from the supermarket on a regular basis, you can pick up frozen ieties for much cheaper, which you can sprinkle over yoghurt or whizz into post-workout smoothies.. Fatty fishWe should all aim to eat at least two portions of fish per week, according to the NHS. Fatty ieties of fish, such as salmon, mackerel, anchovies and sardines, supply us with EPA and DHA - long-chain, omega- fatty acids that have well-documented anti-inflammatory properties.When you eat these kinds of fish, your body breaks down the marine fatty acids into compounds called resolvins and protectins, which can help to reduce levels of inflammation in the body.Tinned fish can be a tasty sandwich-filler, while larger cuts of salmon and tuna are great for adding into salads as a substitute for meat..

With Labour and the LibDems being seen as ldquolosers in the recent election, little attention is being given to the fact that their manestos contained proposals for a Constitutional Commission being established to come up with some form of practical federalism. North of the Border we talk of Devo Max. Without a third option a repeat of the binary Yes No in indyref could lead to disaster with no lessons having been learned from the politics of ision of the past five years.:Lord Advocate James Wolffe to step down within daysIn this context I was much encouraged by Andy Maciverrsquos article Scotland away ... and how to stop doing it, May  and by Gavin Eslerrsquos splendid book How Britain Ends: English Nationalism and the Rebirth of Four Nations.Both Mr Maciverrsquos and Mr Eslerrsquos approach can be summed up by Mr Maciverrsquos assertion that ldquounionists must reimagine unionism. The only viable United Kingdom, now, is a looser kingdom at ease with its many identities and embracing its political ersity and by Mr Eslerrsquos ldquoHome Rule for All Nations will not be easy. But it is probably the last chance of saving the many good things about our United Kingdom, building upon the UKrsquos existing quasi-federal structure being the obvious way to proceed.Furthermore a reading of both reveals that the more rational Scottish nationalists recognise that in this day and age there can be no ldquoabsolute independence and as a consequence it is not entirely inconceivable that they and the ldquofederalists may not be so far apart when it comes to the crunch, the minorities of ultra unionists and Scottish nationalists being the only opposition to the achievement of a reasonable solution.And so the UK needs a Devo Max movement, the core of which is surely to be found in the Labour Party ldquowith Sir Keir Starmerrsquos idea of a constitutional convention being a reasonable first step , as Mr Esler suggests.John Milne, Uddingston.WHY SHOULD WE JUMP OFF A CLIFF NICOLA Sturgeon rightly said in her acceptance speech on re-election as First Minister, that those of who do not support independence cannot be ldquobludgeoned towards an outcome you have not been persuaded of.:Iain Macwhirter: Time to cancel university bosses who violate laws on free speechWith those words the First Minister sums up how it has felt living over the last many years in Scotland, for those who value what we share with our fellow citizens across the UK.Day in, day out, the heavy hand of Scottish nationalism has made its presence felt, badly mismanaging critical public services like education, whilst simultaneously seeking to impose a ldquowe-know-best attitude into many aspects of our lives. All the while, the SNP leadership has used every opportunity to stir grievance against the UK, promoting ision rather than recognising the benefits of working positively together.Despite warm-sounding political spin, the First Ministerrsquos acceptance speech reasserts the SNPrsquos determination to impose its will on the half of Scotland who oppose it. Meanwhile, we have no hint of clarity or honesty on reasonable concerns over the challenges the SNPrsquos overriding objective will likely mean for us.As some countries look forward to enjoying a period of calm normality once they emerge from the awful effects of Covid, our First Minister instead offers us a vision of ision and uncertainty. Using her own favourite Brexit imagery, she appears to want Scotland to join hands with her and jump off a clf into the unknown, simply because she says we should.Keith Howell, West Linton.FIGURES SHOW WERE NECK AND NECKGERALD Edwardspresents the tired old contention that the SNP ldquoonly secured  per cent of the ldquoavailable constituency vote.

Pete Townshend wrote: ldquoThe simple things you see are all complicated.This perfectly describes atmospheric processes.The basics are simple. Earthrsquos atmosphere is absorbing and retaining more solar energy as this is trapped by greenhouse gases. This energy is either dissipated or stored in a iety of ways, with dferent outcomes, all governed by basic physical processes. The atmosphere behaves in line with the combined gas laws. Pressure, volume and temperature constantly interact.Kinetic is movement energy, of both wind and water. More atmospheric energy will mean more wind, bigger waves, and even faster or disrupted flows of ocean currents. A present benefit to us is that the Forth and Clyde are not icebound in winter.More kinetic energy means peak events like hurricanes are likely to be more powerful.Storm energy can be dissipated in electric storms like thundersnow, once rare, now frequent.Both atmosphere and oceans may absorb more heat energy, so temperatures rise.Warmer oceans hold more dissolved gases, becoming more acid. This can have a dramatic effect on marine lersquos ability to survive, corals being a sensitive le form. Corals store carbonates in their reefs. This is a knock-on impact. Fewer corals means less take-up of carbon. These feedback loops intensy climate change impacts.Warmer air in higher latitudes and altitudes will melt more polar and glacier ice. Oceanic thermal expansion will also cause sea level rise,it is not sea ice.The albedo effect ndash reflectivity ndash complicates ice loss impacts. Open sea, formerly ice-covered, absorbs more heat energy than highly reflective ice floes, thus allowing more rapid heat transfers in high latitude oceans. This then accelerates further ice melt.Another basic physical process ndash latent heat, or conversion energy, governs the melting of ice into water . Ice melting, in huge masses, requires a much larger energy transfer than just raising it from -C to C.Mass transfers of energy are needed to drive the hydrological cycle. Water vapour evaporates from the seas, condenses into clouds, then rain or snow.More energy can mean higher rain or snowfall. Additional cloud cover reflects more solar energy so we also have to account for a mitigating impact.Yet, some large air masses stall and produce longer periods of stable drier or hotter weather leading to droughts, and increased fire risk, especially in Mediterranean climates.These are all energy transfers. Feedback loops within these systems then either accelerate or slow processes. It isnrsquot a neat linear progression.Climate is the average weather over a -year cycle. Single weeks, months, even years can erge from the overall direction of longer term trends. Such is \"bias\" or \"noise\". No atmospheric scientist will say any single peak event is definitely caused by climate change. Yet over time more storms and powerful weather events are likely.One of the problems of climate change is that fish donrsquot see water. Wersquore immersed in daily weather patterns so the bigger picture is often concealed.Mr Crossrsquos piscine observations are one such example.Tony Philpin, Gigha.LOCKDOWNS ARE NOT THE ANSWERGLASGOW is facing a lockdown extension . But there are many scientic studies that cast doubt on the efficacy of lockdowns. For example, in December a Korean team led by S Hong published a study which says that, except for school closures and contact tracing, all non-clinical Covid measures ldquoare proven to be statistically insignicant or even have a negative impact.A Stanford team led by E Bendavid published a paper in January which says ldquothere is no evidence that more restrictive nonpharmaceutical interventionscontributed substantially to bending the curve of new cases in England, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain or the US in early .And in February a Canadian study published by A Joffe says that the recession and austerity resulting from government lockdowns ldquocan be expected to cause far more loss of le and well-being over the long run than Covid- can.Government ministers and advisors should be askedtheyre willing to forego their salaries for the duration of any lockdown.Geoff Moore, Alness.BBC SHOULD AXE QUESTION TIMERON McKays comments on Question Timehit the mark.

There were cinemas everywhere and it was onersquos civic duty to go at least once a day.The MacDonald clan came late to the television culture. My dad said it was chewing gum for the eyes. He didnrsquot fund chewing gum for the gub so by the time we had a telly I basically had a job and had left home.Fairly quickly, my job as a sub-editor involved working at night and daytime telly was a test card, though at first it took my half an hour to realise this. I had mistaken it for a Pinter play.Subsequently, I was on the road as a sports journalist and did not have a telly. My mate, in an outbreak of charity, once delivered an unwanted one to a flat I was occupying in my orced dotage. It was called a studio flat. Only because lsquoflat as small as a telephone boxrsquo doesnrsquot have quite the same allure to potential renters.:Hugh MacDonald: Across the water and back to the past, the journey that leads me to childhoodThe gted, ancient TV had a back on it like Quasimodo wearing a rucksack. This, combined with the size of the only room, meant that I could have the telly but could only watch itI opened the front door and stood outside. I did this only a couple of times a week.But the triumphal accession to a state pension has been accompanied by a series of welcome innovations. I am now allowed to walk very slowly on busy streets, feign being hard of hearing to jobsworths, and allowed personal shopping facilities in the cardigan section of local stores.I also have invested in a new telly. It cost more than a premier league striker and covers one my walls in my suburban garret. I came to it with all the joyous innocence of an Amazonian Indian observing his first Iron Bird.My aim was to see what all the fuss was about. I was not completely ignorant. I save that trait for writing columns. No, I had been nurtured on the brilliance of Morecambe and Wise, glimpsed the odd stocking on Play for Today and watched football matches, the last usually in pubs after having ingested industrial qualities ethanol.I therefore knew TV had its merits but was content to leave these with others.As I grew older, I was still a pictures man. It had its rewards. Tarantino with a growing son. Trainspotting with a precocious daughter. The GFT on a Monday night became a ritual. I cut out the old Sunday Herald voucher and went without discrimination. I was rewarded by some marvellous films I may have otherwise missed: The Prophet, most of Terence Davies, some of Steve McQueen, director not actor.John WayneThe GFT, incidentally, was ato childhood. My auntie worked there when it was the Cosmo and we were ushered in regularly without paying. I watched everything I could without judging it good or bad. It was the pictures. That was more than enough.Thus as a callow youth I could watch Viscontirsquos Death in Venice without being encumbered by any need to understand it. Which was handy.My comprehension increased through the years and my attendance was constant. Until Covid.

Some of them are dedicated to special subjects such as shouting in kitchens, showing people houses they wonrsquot buy, and talking on the phone while not wearing clothes.But there is other stuff. It shows that we are living in the golden age of television. It stretches back to the Sopranos which was first broadcast in  and ushered in a st century that has already been marked by televisual genius.The small screen has stretched to accommodate innovation in storytelling, framing and theme. Bold broadcasters have allowed series to take their time. Background can be painted exquisitely, characters can be built intricately, stories can unfold like a slow, rolling wave.Comedies, too, need not have a laugh every line. They can be reserved, even coy. The laugh can come almost as a surprise in the style of Schittrsquos Creek or as a release in Curb Your Enthusiasm, both of which would not have survived the first peek of a th century commissioning editor.There has also been a proleration of extraordinary documentaries that ally the power of the visual to taut, concise storytelling.

The world is watching the pain of Palestine with horror. ldquoBothsideing doesnrsquot cut it. People who were scared to speak out have decided that staying neutral in the face of brutality is not an ethical option.I visited Palestine in  to meet farmers in the occupied West Bank. Their resilience under the boot of Israeli occupation was extraordinary. We travelled from East Jerusalem, to Ramallah, Nablus, Jericho, and Jenin, and met producers like Taysir Sadia Yaseen who kept growing olives even though  of his familyrsquos , trees had been bulldozed by Israel to make way for a \"security buffer zone around an encroaching, illegal settlement.I spoke with women who make the Palestinian speciality, maftoul, similar to couscous.

These settlers looked unhinged and highly volatile. Nowhere have I felt so threatened.Palestinians put up with this ever day of their lives.When I ed from the West Bank I wrote articles for news outlets calling on consumers to boycott Israeli and settlement products, such as Medjoul dates, as part of the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign.A Palestinian protesterIt uses the same tactics as the South African anti-apartheid movement.There were letters of complaint but my pieces were published.In more recent years, those articles may not have seen the light of day because the Israeli government, by deliberately conflating all criticism of Israel with antisemitism, had effectively silenced it.The respected Palestinian academic Edward Said nailed it: ldquoFear of speaking out about one of the greatest injustices in modern history has hobbled, blinkered, muzzled many who know the truth and are in a position to serve it.Glasgow University professor of communications and social change Greg Philo quoted an editor who, defending his news operationrsquos attempts to portray the situation as two evenly matched sides in a war, rather than the systematic oppression of a stateless people by one of the worldrsquos most technologically advanced armies, as saying: ldquoWe wait in fear for the telephone call from the Israelis.rsquoBefore the latest Gaza onslaught, we watched the trial-by-media of Jeremy Corbyn, hounded as an anti-semite for sticking up for Palestinians.The idea that he is anti-semitic is preposterous, a monstrous slur. Yet many media outlets joined the witch-hunt lest the bullies added them to its target list.Perhaps now that Israel has razed the tower block that housed the Associated Press and Al Jazeera news agencies, the fourth estate might find the bottle to craft reports around the facts on the ground, not Israeli government spin,only to show support for their fellow journalists.:Joanna Blythman: Its not up to politicians to tell us that we cant hug our loved onesThose facts, as I see them, are as follows.The context is half a century of illegal occupation. The recent violence was provoked by Israeli troops who attacked praying Palestinians in al-Aqsa mosque with tear gas and rubber-coated steel bullets, and the escalation of expulsions of Palestinians from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah, East Jerusalem, in defiance of international law.Since then wersquove seen the usual asymmetric death toll repeat. As I write over  Palestinians have been killed, including  women and  children.  Israelis have been killed, including one child. Since , Israel has killed roughly , Palestinians, more than half of them civilians , were children.The Public International Law Centre rightly condemns the current situation in Gaza as ldquoa scene of historic and current human rights violations, and in some cases, war crimes.There is no moral equivalence here.

During it, Mr OrsquoConnor asks Professor Dawkinshe stands by advice he once offered to a woman who was unsure of the correct course of action in the event of being pregnant with a Downrsquos syndrome baby. The professor had told her: ldquoAbort it and try again. It would be immoral to bring it into the worldyou have a choice.Mr OrsquoConnor declares his interest in this debate from the outset. He has a daughter with Downrsquos syndrome but he maintains a high level of professional detachment throughout the interview and conducts it in a spirit of polite inquiry. What follows from Professor Dawkins is perhaps the bleakest evaluation of humanity yoursquore likely to hear in a modern setting. What adds to the chill factor, I think, is that it also prescribes an inevitable direction of travel when the state presumes to legislate on matters surrounding end-of-le care.: English Tory triumph means that independence is our last refuge, by Kevin McKennaThe professor partially retreats from his original opinion by withdrawing the term lsquoimmoralrsquo. He suggests rather that it would be ldquowise and sensible in such circumstances to opt for an abortion. His justication for this is his assertion that ldquothe amount of suffering in the world probably does not go down ndash probably goes up ndash compared to having another child who doesnrsquot have Downrsquos syndrome. Professor Dawkins, a biologist who appeals to scientic fact during his regular trolling of people who profess religious faith, admits his view about what constitutes lsquosufferingrsquo is evidence-free. ldquoIt seems to me to be plausible I have no direct evidence, he tells the interviewer when pressed.Wersquoll leave aside the issue of how much an affluent white man residing in a rich country can ever fully grasp the concept of human suffering and its effects. These happy accidents of birth and the advantages they have bestowed on Mr Dawkins means he will always be inoculated from the suffering of multitudes of other humans less favoured. As a gted biologist the professor has used his advantages well in advancing our understanding of ourselves and the world we inhabit. Inexplicably though, the knowledge he has gathered about the beautul ersity of creation seems not to have increased his compassion for it, but soiled it. What he is professing amounts to eugenics: the belief that only the fittest or best-equipped among us deserve to experience quality in our lives.Here, I must declare my own interest in this issue: I have a niece with Downrsquos syndrome. Itrsquos impossible to convey in a column such as this how much hurt she would feel, knowing that another human being harboured thoughts such as these how reduced how unloved how devalued. Ciara is a young woman now and, having known only the love of a large extended family, is embarking on a journey into adulthood and a future that holds the promise of good things.She has already represented her country in ious sports and, thanks to the skills, dedication and compassion of her primary school teachersshe is living a full le. She is also contributing to the happiness of others, this being a basic requirement for peaceful co-existence on earth. Professor Dawkins in his cruel, arrogant ignorance believes she and millions of others with Downrsquos syndrome are incapable of such. And lacking any evidence he chooses to see only that which he regards as other and abnormal and that these must be feared ndash and thus destroyed. It is the philosophy of Salem.Richard DawkinsYou hesitate to sign an entreaty that might adversely affect anotherrsquos ability to earn their keep. The Donrsquot Screen Us Out petition though, leaves room for Professor Dawkins to reconsider his views and their consequences for humanitythey ever entered the mainstream. It says this: ldquoPenguin Random House publishes Richard Dawkinsrsquo books. As a company, they make it clear that they ldquocelebrate and actively promote ersity and inclusion in all its forms, including and not limited to the nine protected characteristics cited in The Equality Act  including ldquodisability. They go on to say that ldquoIt is not acceptable to make dismissive or hostile remarks about a person on any basis or to make assumptions about someonersquos lestyle, interests or abilities.You may be tempted to dismiss criticism of the professor on the basis that, as a high-profile atheist they are consistent with a view that there is no ultimate force for good and that we must simply let the dice roll as they please. lsquoMoralityrsquo being merely existential, this is a grand space to inhabit in which you can set your own boundaries on what you consider to be lsquogoodrsquo. It conveniently frees us from any moral obligation to make the world lsquobetterrsquo.:Downs children like my beautul niece Ciara are a gt ndash not a burdenYet, itrsquos not on the basis of uncertain and precarious religious faith that we must disdain Professor Dawkinsrsquo barren evaluation of humanity. None of us was born complete. We will never be the finished article. At some point in our lives we will require to be fixed and restored. On these occasions the healing can only be provided by others and rests on their willingness to give something of themselves while asking nothing in .For many, the brokenness is long-lasting or permanent and may never be healed. This will call for an extraordinary measure of unconditional devotion that resists the urge to calculate cost or predict benefits. Itrsquos perhaps the most perfect love of all, but itrsquos one which we all have the capacity to offer.

His was made even more daunting by the pouring rain. Scott was so moved by what he saw that he wrote The Umbrellas Of Shibuya, a stunning song which helped colour the album he now regards as a career high.ldquoI was doing an acoustic tour of Japan along with Duglas T. Stewart of The BMX Bandits, said Scott.:Hue And Cry: Remote. Scotlands favourite albumsldquoIn Shibuya Station we both looked out over the plaza. It was raining and there were thousands of people carrying multi-coloured plastic umbrellas on the crossing. I was overwhelmed by the visual beauty of what was in front of me.

Their craft is reflected in his own. The album was recorded in a studio at East Kilbride Arts Centre. The catalyst for the record was when Scott took part in Burnsong ndash a creative workshop staged in Croys, a country house in Castle Douglas ndash where a group of musicians were put together to write with each other for the first time.:Lloyd Cole, Madness, Eighties pop: A Week in RadioldquoIrsquod never done very much co-writing up until that point, he revealed.ldquoBut I really enjoyed it and wrote a bunch of songs I liked. Although none of them actually ended up on the album, I really got into a flow and from that point on the songs were coming steadily. Some of the energy for the album came from that event.Scott already had an impressive musical track record. Between -, hersquod released six albums and toured the UK.His seventh record, Up With The Larks, evolved during a particularly fertile period.ldquoThe songs on the record are probably the best Irsquove ever written, he said.ldquoThey came at a time when I was busy on several dferent projects. But in the studio, I had vocal mics plus the piano and a drum kit set up permanently. SoI ever wanted to work on a new song, I literally just had to press lsquoPlayrsquo and lsquoRecordrsquo.As ever, his lyrics were flavoured by experience. The first batch of songs included The Bluebells, Eco Schools, Londonrsquos In Love and Blue Riders On The Range. ldquoThe Bluebells was the first big song. Itrsquos a love song for my we Margaret, revealed Davie.:Billy Sloan: Associatesrsquo ground-breaking debut was both baffling and beguilingldquoItrsquos about perpetual love hellip so it almost wrote itself. When I had that, I thought, this is something worth building on.ldquoIrsquod also had a letter from a local primary school asking me to come and talk to the kids about having a career in the music business. It was an eco-school, where they had a real dedication to the environment, with an eco-council and eco-warriors, who do sustainable work. That also led to a song.Blue Riders On The Range ndash one of my favourite tracks on the album ndash channels the influence of Brian Wilson, and in particular, Paul McCartney.ldquoI was sitting at the piano improvising some chord ideas, and suddenly I got little bits I could work with hellip almost like doing a sculpture, he recalled.ldquoThe song came from a feeling of trying to escape your everyday le and find something magical. Itrsquos that whole Brian Wilson approach. But,there is a real sonic template for the track, itrsquos more Paul McCartneyrsquos  album, Ram. When I hear that song itrsquos really me trying to do Ram.Itrsquos also one of four songs on the record produced by Scottrsquos close friend, Norman Blake of Teenage Fanclub.:Orange Juice: The Glasgow School: Released ndash . Scotlands favourite albums by Billy SloanldquoI wanted something a little bit dferent in the production process, so I asked Norman to work on a few tracks, he said. ldquoWe just clicked, as we always have done. Therersquos a real bond. The thing that probably turned it into the song it is hellip is that big, but very simple chorus of three chords and four words, where I sing lsquoGet on a feeling Get on a feelingrsquo.ldquoNorman was responsible for the extra choruses at the end. Irsquod had the song quite tight until he said: lsquoYoursquove GOT to repeat that chorusrsquo.ldquoHe wanted to hear it again and again. Norman was a real big part of those tracks. Even just down to the feeling in the room. Other key songs include the autobiographical, Fighting Fire With Flowers. Scott said: ldquoThere are three verses in that song. The first is about something that happened at school when I got into a fight. The second is about my teenage years sitting in The Bouled Cafeacute in Falkirk hellip and the third is more of a widescreen look at the way the world is always at war.Plus the sublime soul of Womack And Womack and I Just See The Rainbow, in which he composed a song for the late Karen Carpenter. ldquoIn my head, I was thinking of her voice hellip I was writing it for her, revealed Scott.ldquoShe was obviously lone gone by then. Butyou listen to the song, just imagine that itrsquos Karen Carpenter who is singing it. When I recorded my vocal I was so focused on that. I donrsquot sound anything like her, but it does have a certain softness about it which was almost like me putting myself into a character.Up With The Larks was well received by both critics and fans alike. Scott has released a further two albums since then and is working on a new record scheduled for later in . He is also currently the Head of Arts and Media at the University of the West Of Scotland.Like all songwriters, he is optimistic that his best song has always got to be his next song. But he has a special affection for Up With The Larks as an accomplished body of work.Scott said:ldquoIrsquom now old enough to know that your existence doesnrsquot necessarily rest on your best work being ahead of you. Irsquom making a new record at the moment and think the songs on it are great. Naturally, you want it to be a brilliant album. Butit turns out not to be as good as Up With The Larks, I wonrsquot cry because I know just how good that music is.ldquoItrsquos a very musical record hellip very melodic. The arrangements are super intricate. I didnrsquot used to think of it as being a particularly lyrical record. But talking about it now, I can see therersquos loads of stuff that is very personal.However, the albumrsquos continued success has given Scott an on-going problem. When The Pearlfishers play live, hersquos got to cherry pick which tracks to perform hellip such is the sheer volume of his back catalogue of songs.ldquoBear in mind that Irsquove now been making records for  years, so you kind of have an overview of what yoursquove done, he said finally.ldquoI can look at every album Irsquove made and feel happy with them. Irsquove enjoyed writing and recording them all hellip and each has got things that I love.ldquoBut Up With The Larks is the album I keep going back to.THE Billy Sloan Show is on BBC Radio Scotland every Saturday at pm.MAKING HISTORYDAVIE Scott of The Pearlfishers has created his music in some of the worldrsquos most famous recording studios. His songs have taken him to the hallowed ground of Abbey Road, where he followed in the footsteps of his hero Paul McCartney. He also worked on albums in live rooms where Pink Floyd and The Who made pop history.But in a -year music career, Scott has made a little bit of magic of his own, in a home-grown studio which wasnrsquot a recording facility at all. He was the in-house producer, composer and general facilitator at East Kilbride Arts Centre.ldquoIt was a medium sized office that I set up to record in, recalled Davie. ldquoIt didnrsquot even have a control room and was very primitive. But we had good microphones, instruments and a piano I borrowed from the Village Theatre. So all the actual equipment to make great records was there.Scott recorded many of The Pearlfishersrsquo albums in the tiny studio. He worked there with Ricky Ross of Deacon Blue, The BMX Bandits, The Pastels and members of Teenage Fanclub.Legendary US acts Alex Chilton, Chip Taylor, Evie Sands and Kim Fowley also made records in the unlikely setting of a converted office in East Kilbride.ldquoThink of a classic album like Sgt. Pepperrsquos hellip it sounds really epic, said Davie.ldquoBut it was made by lashing a couple of four-track recorders together. The point is to get the songs and arrangements right, and then make sure itrsquos recorded pretty faithfully. You can do that anywhere.ldquoWe recorded very simply. There was no monkey business. It was a makesht studio, but it lasted for  very successful years. We produced a ton of great records there.For Up With The Larks, Scott decided to give the album sleeve ndash a series of childlike drawings of birds ndash a real personal flavour.ldquoI made the artwork under the name of Oscar In Venice, revealed Davie.ldquoStefan Kassell, the designer at Marina Records, took these little scraps of paper I had ndash felt pen drawings ndash and organised them into this brilliant album package.ldquoTherersquos also a lovely wee postscript to the story. I was contacted by the producer of the hit American TV drama, Veronica Mars. He was a fan of the band and commissioned a full size painting of the front cover which I had shipped over to Los Angeles. It sits in his house to this day."},{"url":null,"title":"sir-walter-scott-scottish-icons-rab-mcneil","story":"man of parts.Best known as a writer, he is also accused of having been active in the legal profession, as an advocate, Clerk of Session, and Sherf-Depute of Selkirkshire, valuable work that interests nobody.Created a baronet in , he organised the groundbreaking visit of George IV to Edinburgh in .Hersquos said to have ldquoinvented Scotland, or at least its public image which, letrsquos face it, is a facade.He first showed his coupon to the world on  August , when he was born up a wynd in Edinburgh.

Back then, posh and pauper lived cheek by jowl, at least in the centre of the smelly old city.:It took  years to build the Wall. Their tradesmen were even worse than ours Rab McNeils Scottish IconsScottrsquos father was a lawyer claiming descent from Clan Scott, while his mother, a physicianrsquos daughter, traced her lot to Clan Swinton. Childhood polio left him lame, which saw him sent to the Borders for a cure. Instead he found a vocation: Aunty Jenny taught him to read.After schooling at Edinburghrsquos Royal High and Kelso Grammar, he attended Edinburgh University at the age of  to study classics and, at , began a legal apprenticeship. At , he became Prime Minister and, at , walked on the surface of the Moon. Only joking but, given the pace of his le story so far, it wouldnrsquot be surprising.As for literature, he first took a fancy to German poems, which he translated for publication. The Germans at that time were interested in folk culturewhich sparked Scottrsquos interest in traditional Border ballads.Before long, Scott himself became the most popular poet in the land, starting with his The Lay of the Last Minstrel, published in . Yersquoll ken these famous lines from the last stanza: ldquoBreathes there a man, with soul so dead Who never to himself hath said This is my own, my native land!Well, yes, there does: see letters page some weeks.His Marmion, a racytale of lust, duels, folk walled up in nunneries, and the Battle of Flodden, also features the famous line: ldquoO what a tangled web we weave When first we practise to deceive.That was published in , by which time he was a right Tory. That same year, he cancelled his subscription to the Edinburgh Review when it advocated peace with Napoleon.:Billy Connolly: lsquoIrsquom the only guy I know who died in a f*****g Muppet moviersquoWaverley, the first of his  novels, was a great success and, despite writing anonymously , everyone knew who he was, and succeeding works would be by ldquothe author of Waverley and so forth.He was massively popular, the Dan Brown of his day. His novels dealt with historical themes, often set in Scotland ndash including Guy Mannering, Redgauntlet, Rob Roy ndash and sometimes in Englandshire, including Ivanhoe, Kenilworth, The Fortunes of Nigel, Peveril of the Peak.Their themes were ious, though one at least could be renamed Nigelrsquos Overdue Mortgage. For the avoidance of doubt, Heart of Midlothian isnrsquot about football, and the short story Wandering Williersquos Taledoesnrsquot concern a sex pest.A major theme is the romantic enchantment of the Jacobite cause, but Scott believed that time was over. He accepted Hanoverian rule. His stance on the national question is occasionally described as ambiguous , but he was a supporter of the Union who sometimes sounded otherwise in his work.However, it never does to confuse a writer and his characters who often, we should note, spoke with a strong Scots brogue, at leastthey were lower class.Scott played a major part in cementing Scotlandrsquos place in the United Kingdom when, in , he organised the pageantry for the visit of King George IV, a debauched lard-bucket, to Scotland. The event saw the ultimate rehabilitation of Highland society, after the previous centuryrsquos Jacobite recalcitrance.:Itrsquos haddock for Humphrey as jakeys neck cans on the pierKing Dod wore a kilt, which habiliment subsequently became popular . The Lowlands compromised with tartan trews, arguably the most hideous habiliment in the history of trousers.If all this sounds like a never-ending success story, disaster struck Scott with the collapse in  of the Ballantyne publishing business, in which he had the sole financial interest. He was ruined. He endeavoured to write himself out of his dire situation, but after a few years his health began to fail, and he died of a stroke at his Borders pile, Abbotsford, on  September . With his books still selling, his estate was cleared of debt after his death.Scott is not an easy read today. In , a columnist on the New York Herald asked: ldquoWho has not read the Pirate  In , a foreword to the novel answered with melancholy honesty: ldquoVirtually everyone. Sentences meander like the Tweed, and the language is lofty.

A bookmark tells me I reached page  out of  of The Pirate. My fault rather than Scottrsquos: I probably started reading a Dan Brown instead.:Sir Alex Ferguson ndash Scottish Icon, by Rab McNeilOn a more positive note, the Encyclopedia Britannica describes Scott appreciatively as ldquothe master of a rich, ornate, seemingly effortless literary style that blended energy with decorum, lyric beauty with clarity of description.This is true, though it still might seem stodgy to us.

But as more classics are converted, the more we are likely to see vehicles from days gone by on our roads.ldquoThere are two camps out there, says Wayne. ldquoOne says we shouldnrsquot do this to a classic vehicle ndash and there are some cars we would not want to touch.ldquoBut there are also a lot of classic cars sitting in garages and barns that donrsquot turn a wheel from year to year because they are dficult cars to live with.ldquoWith a lot of older cars, you need a toolkit with you whenever you go for a drive.

No-one is actually harmed by this proto-censorship, apart from the students depriving themselves of the opportunity to learn. But things have taken a truly sinister turn in recent weeks.The lives of students like Lisa Keogh at Abertay, and lecturers like Dr Neil Thin at Edinburgh, are being destroyed by crack-handed inquisitions applying Monty Python concepts of justice. Lisa Keoghrsquos advocate, Joanna Cherry MP, has rightly condemned Abertayrsquos violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.:Michael Settle: The reinvention of Project Fear - but will it be a winning combination Highly-paid university principals should now be held to account for failing to defend free speech. Ms Keoghrsquos only crime was to express a wholly-respectable opinion in a debate. She insisted that ldquowomen have vaginas ndash an observation that is only a heresy to advocates of non-binary dogma.Dr Neil Thin was suspended from his role as a senior lecturer in anthropology for criticising the risible decision by Edinburgh University last year to ldquocancel Scotlandrsquos greatest philosopher by striking his name from the David Hume Tower. This for a footnote to an article in  that was disparaging about non-white races.Dr Thin was echoing the views of Scotlandrsquos leading historian, Sir Tom Devine. As former Rector of Edinburgh University I also expressed my dismay at this stupefying act of intellectual philistinism, which has made Edinburgh University an international joke. They had been intending to rename it ldquoJulius Nyerere Tower until someone pointed out that the late president of Tanzania was a homophobe as well as a dictator.I pointed out that its new official name, ldquo George Square, celebrates King George , an ardent imperialist who was responsible for an unprecedented expansion of British colonialism. But they didnrsquot get it.Many academics were horried at the Hume Tower affair, but they kept silent, terried of culture warrior retribution. Dr Thin also had the temerity to question whether a campus event called ldquoResisting Whiteness, which involved people of colour only, didnrsquot look just a bit like ldquosegregation. This elicited howls of protest at his ldquoracism.Any self-respecting institution of higher learning would dismiss such accusations as ridiculous. But principal Peter Mathieson suspended Dr Thin, following claims by students that his remarks were ldquoproblematic and ldquooffensive.What he should have done was censure the students who had called Dr Thin a racist, when he is clearly nothing of the sort. I have looked at the social media comments made by Dr Thin, and none of them could be regarded by any reasonable person as expressing racism. He said what any open-minded person would say about an event which was quite literally segregated on the basis of race. His support for Sir Tom Devine is what every self-respecting academic should have done.I donrsquot particularly blame the students of BlackED for mounting a daft, attention-seeking campaign. Thatrsquos what students do. But I do blame the university authorities for responding to it and validating what was in reality a campaign of intimidation and abuse against a member of staff. These extreme anti-colonialist and non-binary dogmas are usually referred to as ldquowoke, but they would be more accurately described as the sleep of reason. Universities are supposed to challenge dogmas and subject political ideas to rigorous criticism. Yet the university authorities seem to be falling over themselves to encourage these infant Robespierres with their empty slogans and pseudo-scientic jargon.:SNP urge Scottish Secretary to fight back or resign over Australia trade dealOver at Abertay University, principal Nigel Seaton last week defended his decision to conduct a disciplinary investigation into -year-old-mature law student Lisa Keogh for saying that ldquowomen have vaginas. This was in a debate where she was invited to state how she defined ldquowoman. She said that, in her opinion, it was essentially based on biology and a womanrsquos reproductive physiology. She also said that ldquomen are stronger than women on account of their sex, and that male-bodied transwomen should not be competing in womenrsquos sporting events. These are views that would be endorsed by the vast majority of adults, and indeed by Americarsquos leading transgender advocate, Caitlyn Jenner.Abertayrsquos response should have been to dismiss objections to her expressing these opinions in open debate. Yet, principal Seaton has authorised a disciplinary investigation into Lisa Keogh, threatening her with expulsion on the grounds that her views may be ldquooffensive and ldquodiscriminatory.:NEIL MACKAYS BIG READ: It was like Lord of the Flies - Horric accounts of abuse could be boarding schoolsrsquo lsquoMeToorsquo momentHe appears to believe that the university is under a legal obligation under equalities legislation to investigate complaints about comments that supposedly violate the protected characteristic of ldquogender reassignment.Principal Seaton is wrong. Equalities legislation does nothing of the sort. In fact, it upholds Lisa Keoghrsquos right to express her gender-critical opinion. This was made absolutely clear last month by Baroness Falkner, the new chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The views of feminists like Lisa Keogh are in no way discriminatory or hate speech. She said that it is ldquoentirely reasonable to believe that women are defined by their sex and no-one should be ldquopenalised or abused for saying so. ldquoSomeone can believe that people who self-identy as a dferent sex are not the dferent sex that they self-identy, she said.Arguably, it should be Abertayrsquos principal under investigation for conniving in this witch-hunt. In a dignied and restrained interview on BBC Womanrsquos Hour last week, Ms Keogh, a mother of two, explained the distress shersquod suffered being forced to defend herself against this Kafkaesque inquisition. In the midst of sitting her law exams she has had the threat of expulsion hanging over her. Not to mention the abuse she has received from student activists calling her ldquoa typical, cis white woman and much worse.These misguided and unlawful actions by university principals are creating a hostile environment in Scotlandrsquos universities. It extends far beyond Edinburgh and Abertay.The threat of sanctions or stressful disciplinary procedures is chilling debate and making lecturers hesitate to discuss controversial issues. Yet this is precisely what any university teacher should be doing. As for research,academics are looking over their shoulders at Twitter, nothing truly original will ever get done. Just a lot of advocacy research designed to confirm whatever prejudices are acceptable on social media.If universities do not enforce freedom of speech and opinion they cannot perform their proper . Scottish taxpayers expect them to do teaching and research ndash not pursue vendettas against wrongthink. Taxpayer-remunerated principals like Peter Mathieson, earning twice the Prime Ministerrsquos salary, are violating their own university charters, which uphold academic freedom and also free speech provisions of international conventions like the ECHR.:Heralds Higher Education Awards: Hard work and dedication pays off for finalistsNor do university bosses, minds addled by culture war, realise the reputational damage these cases are inflicting on their institutions. Edinburgh University used to get rectors like myself to schmooze rich, potential donors and wealthy American parents willing to pay exorbitant fees.

Just how do you hurt a military junta while ensuring that the people it oppresses are not hurt too Itrsquos over  days now since the February  coup in Myanmar when the army under Senior General Min Aung Hlaing seized power, overthrowing and detaining the elected civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.Since then, given the widespread protests and brutal crackdown by the regime alongside calls for international sanctions and boycott campaigns, Myanmar has been both a chaotic place to do business and posed an ethical challenge for foreign companies with links to the country.In few other sectors has this been more apparent than in the countryrsquos garments industry. The announcement then last week by international clothing companies including HM and Primark saying they have resumed placing orders with suppliers in Myanmar for the first time following the coup has once again thrown the spotlight on what qualies as ethical trading and due diligence over human rights and supply chains.Both the UK and Swedish companies were among those that suspended orders from the south-east Asian country because of human rights concerns and civil unrest. This is a country where nearly half a million people are employed in factories producing textiles for retailers that also include, among many others, Gap, Next, Adidasand Zara.Shortly after the military seized power, HM was among the  foreign investors in Myanmar who signed a statement committing to the country and employees there during developments of ldquodeep concern. Subsequently, HM said it had been shocked ldquoby the use of deadly force against protesters in Myanmar.lsquoNo direct linksrsquoAS the worldrsquos second-biggest fashion retailer, HM has more than , people relying on jobs at its textile hubs and says its decision now to resume placing orders is based on both concern over job losses and making good on commitments to its Myanmar suppliers. After due diligence, HM has now concluded that as a company it has no direct links with the military in Myanmar.ldquoWe are now looking for legal guidance on how to handle any potential indirect links international companies may have, the retailer assured.ldquoWith our decision we want to avoid the imminent risk of our suppliers having to close their factories which would inevitably result in unemployment for tens of thousands of garment workers, the Swedish company explained.In turn, Primark said it was committed to honouring its existing orders from its Myanmar suppliers ldquohowever long they take to fulfil, adding that it had ldquorecommenced placing some orders with our key strategic suppliers in the country.But as the Financial Times last week pointed out, CA, the Belgian-German-Dutch chain of fast-fashion retail stores, has adopted a dferent stance, telling its suppliers that ldquowe are at this point ndashunless we see signicant improvements within the country ndash not placing any new orders.And so once again, as with other similar global crises in the past, in Myanmar today the question of just how corporate groups should respond to such challenges remains a subject of some industry debate.For those foreign companies operating in the country their presence has long been a juggle between high risk and potential high reward. After half a century of military rule, the opening up of one of Asiarsquos last frontier markets in  led to a surge in foreign direct investment.Huge investmentIN the specic case of Myanmarrsquos garments and apparel industry, foreign investment has surged over the past decade as economic reforms and an end to Western sanctions and trade deals helped establish the sector as the greatest symbol of its nascent emergence as a manufacturing hub.Myanmar garment shipments rose from less than  billion in , about  per cent of exports, to more than .bn in , about % of exports, according to UN Comtrade data.The first blow to this increasingly lucrative sector came with the coronavirus pandemic which as it plunged the world into recession, choked consumer demand, resulting in tens of thousands of lost garment factory jobs in Myanmar and where in Asia.But Myanmarrsquos garment industry was then hit with another blow in the shape of the coup. Since then, it has been workers and trade union leaders, many from within the garment sector, who have played a leading role in organising protests against the military junta.As international condemnation of the coup and the crackdown against these protests grew, European and US fashion brands, among them HM, Primark, Next and Italyrsquos Benetton, began to express through statements their respective positions and stances.While HM and Primark initially simply halted orders, Next said it would split its orders previously going to Myanmar between Bangladesh, Cambodia and China, while Benetton said it would mainly move business to China.ldquoThey donrsquot want to abandon Myanmar ... but itrsquos being forced upon them, said Peter McAllister of Ethical Trade Initiative , a labour rights organisation whose members include European high-street brands.Speaking to Reuters Business News last month, McAllister said that it would be very dficult for Myanmarrsquos garment sector to recoverChinese investors left, given that its estimated Chinese nationals fund nearly one-third of Myanmarrsquos  garment factories, according to the Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association. That would make the Chinese by far the largest investor group.And therein lies the real problem given that a few Chinese-financed garment factories have in some instances found themselves razed to the ground as anti- Chinese sentiment grew along with the belief that Beijing was supplying, directing and on the international stage diplomatically defending Aung Hlaingrsquos regime.But this still begs the question: why would people who earn their living from these factories want to burn them down Nick Vyas, an associate professor at the University of Southern Calornia and an expert in end-to-end global supply chain management, believes some protesters see such factories as obstacles to the type of change they want.ldquoThe entire protest in Myanmar is led by the people and a big chunk of this group thatrsquos leading this protest, the ones who donrsquot want to go back to the past and live under the dictatorial military rule, are the people working in the garment factories, Vyas explained in an interview with Insider, the financial global news portal.ldquoThese people are working six days a week, sometimes seven days a week, and there are disputes sometimes about not being paid overtime, issues with benefits, and not being able to unionise.ldquoSo even before this military protest and the coup, there has been some bad history with the previous government of Aung San Suu Kyi not standing up for workerrsquos rights, Vyas said, adding that because the factories are ownedby China, some protesters view themas part of the cycle that prevents change.Cheap labourVyas describes the cycle as follows: ldquoThe garment workers provide cheap labour to these factories, which helps China grow its influence in Myanmar. Then, Chinarsquos lack of support for protesters bolsters the military regime, which then cracks down on pro-democracy movements.Itrsquos a complicated political situation, one that only adds to the existing challenges of how to operate an ethical trading and supply chain approach that does not appease the junta but does not jeopardise the livelihoods of workers, most of them women who earn as little as , kyata day, the lowest rates in the region.Views dfer on the best approach.Chris Sidoti was part of a UN-ledfact-finding mission which in  urged foreign firms to cut business ties with Myanmarrsquos military over human rights abuses and pursue private sector investments there instead.He sees the situation now as dferent with a military regime in place that has taken over every aspect of government, making it now risky to do any business there. ldquoIf businesses are responsible, they will put everything on hold at this point, Sidoti told Reuters barely a month after the coup, before going on to form an independent advisory group on Myanmar with some other former UN investigators.But, as history has shown, sometimes sanctions hurt more than they help. Previous sanctions on Myanmar have had a humanitarian impact. For example, the US state department estimated that a  US ban on Burmese textile imports cost -, jobs .Given such past experiences, other activist groups today have called for a more nuanced approach, conscious of the economic fragility of Myanmar and the vast poverty that still prevails in much of the country.Long before the coup, Myanmar was widely being described as a ldquofragile state because of its economic uncertainty, institutional dys, and political instability. But the danger now, say some analysts, is that a heavy-handed blanket approach of punitive sanctions could easily turn it into a failed state.A nuanced approach, say observers, is vastly dferent from those expanded sanctions by Western governments targeting the vast network of the Myanmar militaryrsquos economic assets, which are based on two conglomerates: Myanmar Economic Holdings Limitedand Myanmar Economic Corporation .ldquoThe debate over the effectiveness of sanctions is bedevilled by many complex iables, including the objectives of the sanctions and the amount of international compliance, observed veteran journalist, filmmaker and Asia-watcher Tom Fawthrop recently in the online magazine, The DiplomatldquoIn addition, the politics of sanctions could be dferentiated into the good, the bad, and the ugly, Fawthrop added.Limited leverageSome also stress that the international communityrsquos ability to influence developments is finite. ldquoThe outside world has limited leverage, the West in particular, says the ICGrsquos Richard Horsey.ldquoThat doesnrsquot mean the West should sit on its hands and do nothing, but it means their actions will not have a determinative effect on what happens.Horsey told the Financial Times recently: ldquoItrsquos a huge problem for the region, and a problem for the international community ... itrsquos a human catastrophe, and one that has direct implications on Myanmarrsquos neighbours.While government sanctions are one thing the corporate approach could be something  again, say activistsrsquo groups, while insisting that Western brands still need to be rigorous with due diligence as to who they work with.The rights group Burma Campaign UK has called on companies not to abandon Myanmar workers but instead look at ways similar to HMrsquos approach highlighted ndash to maintain placing orders with suppliers albeit under strict scrutiny.John Bray, director at business consultancy Control Risks, said that pressure on firms in Myanmar needed to be guided by an assessment of ldquocomplicity.ldquoIf you are providing a service for the Myanmar people, which they are paid for and which promotes the development of the economy, I donrsquot think yoursquore complicit in what is going on in the streets, said Bray.For the moment there remain some Myanmar union leaders and rights groups that continue to urge clothing chains to stop buying from suppliers in the country to intensy economic pressure on Min Aung Hlaingrsquos junta.But equally there are others who stress that the proceeds from the garment industry for the most part do not go directly into the regimersquos coffers, unlike industries like gemstones, timber, and oil andgas.Many in this latter camp are of the view that what matters more than anything right now is to keep alive structures and jobs outside of the juntarsquos control that will keep people working, eating and afloat.Just how many other clothing companies and retailers make the same decision as HM and Primark, and now resume placing orders with suppliers in Myanmar, remains to be seen.ldquoThe brands feel they have a commitment to the country, and just cutting and running wonrsquot solve anybodyrsquos problems, said Vicky Bowman, director of the Myanmar Centre for Responsible Businessthat advocates for human rights.Itrsquos quite a dilemma, but just how many of us, I wonder, will even pause to give it a thought next time we pick up a garment with a label that says ldquoMade in

He used the forgeries to dupe Dianarsquos younger brother Earl Spencer into arranging a meeting with her, and the subsequent TV interview.But more than that, Spencer claims Bashir told him that she was being watched by MI and that there was a plot to kill her. The interview went ahead as we know. Bashirrsquos explanation about why he commissioned the forgeries  He didnrsquot know why he did it. It was ldquostupid. Itrsquos worse than that and it may well be criminal.Tony Hall, then the BBCrsquos head of news and subsequently director-general, sent Bashir a note telling him: ldquoYou should be very proud of your scoop. When doubts were raised about the methods involved he led a whitewash, what the corporation called an inquiry, which totally exonerated Bashir.Spencer was not asked for his side of it, even although Bashir had admitted the forgeries and the brokering of the interview. Hall also misled the BBC board about the circumstances surrounding it. The corporation then, as Lord John Dysonrsquos report into the shoddy affair reveals, instituted a cover-up.In any other news organisation, in any reputable business, when the circumstances of the fraudulent deception were clear, Bashir would have been given  minutes to clear his desk and leave the building.

If it reaches , signatures it will be debated in the Parliament. Details next week.Appy daysTHE Happiness Project. It sounds like a Hollywood movie, or something vaguely religious involving incantations and possibly trepanning, but itrsquos actually a smartphone app which aims to do what it says on the screen. It has been developed by neuroscientists at the University College London with funding from the Medical Research Council and other mental health bodies.There are four games focusing on something scientists feel is important for happiness: uncertainty, thinking about the future, learning, and effort. There are spinning circles, animals and fish with the games asking you for your happiness reaction. It seems a bit simplistic, but then Irsquom not a neuroscientistApparently therersquos something called the ldquohedonic treadmill which is when you donrsquot feel lasting happiness about something good that has happened to you. Perhaps wersquore supposed to feel bad or guilty about this. All I can say is that when I started the games I was in a mellow mood and when I gave up I was angry about the futility of it. That canrsquot be a reaction they were looking for Out of borderLAST month, a Belgian farmer was ploughing a field when he noticed a large stone in his way. So he did what farmers do and threw it out of the way ndash about seven feet away ndash thus redrawing the border between Belgium and France, making his country larger and France smaller. It was a border stone which had been in place since  until the angry farmer expanded his country.This, of course, has ramications for Scottish independence seekers. Those idiots from Scottish Resistance, three men and a mangy cur, could, night after night, move that border sign with England just a few metres north and no-one would notice. After a month or two the unionist-voting Borders would be in England and independence would be a shoo-in.A beautul mindSHE was a bit before my time but Hedy Lamarr was a woman ahead of her own time. She was an Austrian-born, American actress billed by MGM as the most beautul woman in the world. But she was a lot more than that.At the age of  the then-Hedy Kiesler took the leading role in what was a highly-controversial film that would be banned in a number of countries including the US. It was a Czech-made movie called Ecstasy, and in it she played the neglected we of an uncaring older man. What was shocking at the time was that it contained the first scene of an actress, her, having an orgasm. In fact, someone stuck her with a pin, which is a bedroom technique I donrsquot think would work today.She married young ndash well, she married six times and had many flings, including with Howard Hughes. But her first husband, a weapons manufacturer who supplied Mussolini, was domineering, forbidding her to act, so she fled ndash first to Paris and then London where Louis B Mayer, head of MGM, spotted her and signed her up.The important work in her le was as an inventor, principally during the Second World War, when the US had still to enter the war and Britain stood alone. She said of it: ldquoBritish fliers were over hostile territory as soon as they crossed the channel, but German aviators were over friendly territory most of the way to England ... I got the idea for my invention when I tried to think of some way to even the balance for the British. A radio-controlled torpedo, I thought, would do it.rsquoTogether with her friend, the composer and pianist George Antheil, they invented a frequency-hopping device which could not be jammed, as signals could be then. They patented it and took it to the US Navy, who thought it was ldquored hot, but because it came from outside the military and, probably, from a woman, they didnrsquot implement it until .Today, the techniques she invented, called spread spectrum, are used in Bluetooth and wi-fi. Next time I use my mobile Irsquoll be thinking of a truly remarkable woman."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"May ,  at : pmOrkney Ferries is set to ride a wave of change, beginning this June, after Orkney Islands Council agreed to cut standard fares by  per cent.

We seek assurances, therefore, that  steps will be taken to ensure that this happens. Close collaboration with locally elected representatives, including the island authorities, will be important but we would encourage you and your officials to look at other ways of making sure this happens from the outset.“Needless to say, we would be happy to meet with you to discuss this matter in more detail.  Meantime, we wish you well in the substantial task that lies ahead and stand ready to assist, particularly in ensuring the needs of our islands are front and centre of government thinking.“We look forward to hearing from you in due course.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We did a huge amount of work including introducing a one-way system, social distancing measures and putting down markers,” said theatre manager Paul Baines. “One of the biggest challenges was getting people in and out safely.“We have to ensure the measures are genuine and effective and they are visible. Visible reassurance is important for customer confidence.“It is a juggling act because you have to balance creating a too clinical atmosphere with offering a unique theatre experience.”The theatre has been awarded the VisitEngland We’re Good to Go industry standard mark, signying that it adheres to government and public health COVID- guidance, also approved by UK Theatre Seat Safety.Alongside familiar COVID- safety measures, Rosie Fraser has introduced a new service called “Silent Treatment”.“We love a good chat but we also understand some people prefer not to,” said Rosie, whose beauty salon opened in .“Clients can see the service as soon as they look at the online booking menu and add it with whatever treatments they are having.“We still carry out a full consultation and then let them just relax.”Also in place are bespoke engraved screens between stations, extra time for cleaning, screening forms for track and trace, PPE and sanitising measures. Rosie emphasises that it is safety with style! Members of the seven-strong team are carrying out rapid COVID- tests at home thanks to the UK Government asymptomatic testing initiative.“We have exciting plans for this year in expanding. COVID- and lockdown has reaffirmed how much people need care and pampering to feel good.”Investment has helped Fish City in Belfast continue operating. The award-winning seafood restaurant extended its seating, installed outdoor heating and started a delivery service. Since reopening for outdoor dining, it has been doing a brisk trade bolstered by confidence in the vaccine programme. Reopening indoors is scheduled to start on May .“We created a dining room upstairs with a completely dferent feel,” said John, who owns the restaurant with his we Grainne. Safety processes include a digital thermometer mounted at the door which all staff and customers are required to pass before entering. Anyone recording a high temperature is refused admission.Hand sanitisers are also available. Kitchen and front of house staff are required to wear masks and wash their hands regularly. Tables and chairs are cleaned rigorously after every diner. The restaurant’s commitment to the safety is also seen in its recognition as COVID- Compliant by Tourism NI.“If I could do cartwheels, I would” is one retail chief’s response to welcoming the public back.“When we saw the first trickle of people coming back last month, it was lovely,” enthused village location manager Meurig Jones. “Portmeirion needs people here.“It’s lovely but it isn’t what it should be without people appreciating it. It’s easier this year in that it was such a new thing when we opened in July.“We had to do a lot of work to train the staff into a new way of working. We’re constantly improving and we’re learning as we go on.”App orders and one-way systems will ensure ongoing safety. Outside seating, pods and marquee are also available. Misting machines, meanwhile, will keep hotels “squeaky clean – safe for staff and guests”.Meurig added: “There’s hand sanitiser outside every shop and we ask people to wear masks indoors, but not outside.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It acknowledges the anxiety that some travellers may have.Loganair chief commercial officer Kay Ryan said: ldquoWe are delighted to play a part in helping showcase Shetlandrsquos stunning scenery and all the great reasons to visit this beautul part of the United Kingdom.ldquoWe are also extremely mindful of our passengersrsquo well-being, and full details of our lsquoFlysafersquo healthy flying protocols are available on our website, along with our lsquoFlexprotectrsquo programme which outlines our flexible bookings conditions as we continue to transition out of travel restrictions.Shetlanders Neil and Natasha Clubb took part in the filming ndash spending the day as ldquotourists enjoying the scenery and famed islesrsquo hospitality.Mr Clubb said being involved was great fun.ldquoWersquove not told many people about it so I canrsquot wait until my friends in Glasgow see it on the TV and realise that itrsquos us,# he said.ldquoThe filming experience was really good fun.

The trio were cared for at the centre after a number of litters were seized at the port, with puppies being taken into the care of local dog rescues across Mid-Antrim.Originally four puppies were brought to the Ballymena Rehoming Centre by authorities, and were named Neo, Asher, April and Daffy by staff there. However, after receiving an initial vet check-up, they were found to have contracted parvovirus and despite best efforts by the team to help her, April sadly passed away. Conor O’Kane, Rehoming Centre Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena said: “When they arrived, we could tell they had been through a traumatic experience and that something was wrong. We had them immediately checked over by a vet and after it was confirmed they had parvovirus they began treatment but unfortunately nothing could be done for April. “We believe they were under the age of eight weeks which is too young to be taken away from their mum or to undertake such signicant travel. After around four weeks of treatment, Asher, Daffy and Neo received a clean bill of health during that time, they had relaxed more and really started to come out of their shells. “It wasn’t long before we were able to find them new owners prepared to give them all the love and care they need to live happy lives, despite their dficult start in le.” Paula Boyden, Veterinary Director at Dogs Trust,said: “An ongoing and very serious issue that faces dogs and potential owners is the illegal trade of puppies. Alongside other animal welfare organisations in Northern Ireland, we have been campaigning for stronger and better enforcement of dog breeding regulations. “It is important that an improved, robust licensing system is developed in Northern Ireland in order to tackle unscrupulous breeders and sellers, alongside effective inspection of licenced breeders to ensure the welfare of dogs. As well as requiring every dog breeder to be registered or licensed, these credentials should be a legal requirement on any advertising that promotes the sale of dogs.” Every year puppies are illegally imported into Great Britain and mis-sold via online ads to unsuspecting dog lovers who think they are getting a healthy, happy home-bred puppy. Dogs Trust is urging potential dog owners to follow the charity’s responsible purchasing advice when getting a puppy:  Potential owners should always call the puppy seller beforehand and should never make any payment in advance of seeing or meeting their new pet  Pitfalls can be avoiding by not rushing into purchasing a puppy and following our buyer advice so potential dog owners aren’t ‘dogfished’. Always ask to see puppy and mum together at their home, evenits via video call to comply with coronavirus restrictions. Ask lots of questions and expect to be asked lots of questions as a good breeder will want to know where the puppy is going  All puppies should be microchipped at eight weeks old and registered to the breeder as the first keeper. Potential owners should be able to check whether paperwork such as pedigree papers, microchipping, proof of vet checks and vaccinations, all match  If, for whatever reason, something doesn’t feel right or you feel pressured into buying when you see or visit them, do not proceed and report to Trading Standards  We would recommend potential owners consider adopting a rescue dog before purchasing a puppy, howeveryou are planning on purchasing a puppy, then make sure you do your homework.

Photo: Kelvin BoyesJohn BreslinMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThere has been no immediate flight price spike following the latest loosening of overseas travel restrictions for Northern Ireland — while those in the industry say holidaymakers are remaining cautious. There are concerns and some confusion over the test needed to be taken by those ing to Northern Ireland, with those from the green list countries told they will need a PCR test rather than the much less expensive lateral flow one for those landing back in England.There was no spike in the price of flights from Belfast to Portugal#s Algarve following the announcement the country is on the green list under the traffic light system for travel.Flights for a family of four in the first two weeks of July have remained steady at around £,, with both EasyJet and Jet. There were plenty of seats available last night on a selection of flights.Travel agents are busy fielding plenty of calls but there is no rush to book as people appear to be holding off and waiting for more choices, said Sandra Corkin, managing director of Oasis Travel in Belfast.Staff at the agency, still limited as some remain on furlough, are busy fielding calls from potential travellers this summer and  but also those who booked last year and were unable to go on their holiday.Whenever England put some countries on to the green list, people knew Northern Ireland would follow so we were taking names and details of people anxious to get away, Ms Corkin said.But it is still a far cry from normal and they are limited to where they can go so a lot of people are still waiting.Most of those actually booking are those where there are no children in the party, while many families are holding off as they will not be travelling until later in the summer.Certainly some people are determined to get away and we have picked up some business, others do not want to be stuck to Portugal.People are still interested in going to Portugal but are worried about the cost of the PCR test, up to £ per person, it’s been warned.NIDirect has all the information on required testing, a Department of Health spokesman said, adding a link to information on travelling from a green list country.You must take a Covid- PCR test on or before day two after you arrive. This must be booked prior to travel, according to the site.On another page of NIDirect related to travelling from abroad, those ing are told they can take either a PCR test of a lateral flow test,For a family of four, the need for PCR tests could add up to £ to the cost of the holiday. They can cost up to £ compared to £ for lateral flow tests.Travel agents fielding calls, particularly from families planning to travel in July or August, are confused at the dference in the rule between Northern Ireland and England.It is a question I have asked myself, why PCR here and lateral flow allowed in England, said Ms Corkin. It would make le a bit easier.Travellers arriving back from Portugal, Israel or Singapore are requested to take an additional free COVID- PCR test on day eight following their .There is hope, Ms Corkin added, for a a change in rules deeper into the summer to allow for travel without testingpeople are vaccinated.In a statement, Jet, which plans to resume flights from Belfast International to Faro on June , said that it is pleased that the Northern Ireland Executive has committed to reopening international travel this summer.” But the company added: We also call for UK-wide clarity over Amber List destinations rather than the current mixed message approach, which only causes confusion for customers.Belfast Most ReadMark Allen goes from black to red: Snooker star declared bankruptBelfastopinion poll: Northern Ireland#s changing political landscape as support for parties revealedRetired cop targeted by New IRAElements of UDA ready to abandon ‘farcical’ LCCINLA men behind show of strength should be jailed, says BeattieTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cbe-ca--ac-aae_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cbe-ca--ac-aae_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPoll puts the DUP on just %PlayVideo: *Graphic content* Iraqi soldiers reportedly executed by ISISPlayVideo: Searching for Taylor Swt in Belfast Latest CoronavirusVaccine passports ‘being prepared for use by NI citizens’Murphy upbeat about a complete end to lockdowns as no new deaths recorded yesterdayCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths and  cases reportedMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling average£m health boost part of new Covid funding for NILatestBrentford critical of FA and EFL over ticket allocation for play-off finalLil Nas X rips crotch of leather trousers on live televisionRecord daily number of second doses administered in UKGovernment to give clarity on aviation, indoor hospitality and events next weekWar graves awareness week aims to honour ‘truly erse nature’ of veterans,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDeputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill of Sinn FeinGareth CrossTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailDespite their recent troubles Sinn Fein#s popularity shows no signs of declining, with the party on course to emerge triumphant following next year#s Assembly election.The party has been subject to repeated criticism over their role in the funeral of former IRA man Bobby Storey, and an internal investigation in Londonderry has seen two MLAs, including senior party figure Martina Anderson, asked to stand down.Regardless, a new poll from LucidTalk for the Belfasthas Sinn Fein on course to become the Assembly#s biggest party at the next election, with Michelle O#Neill set to become First Minister.One quarter of the electorate in Northern Irelandsaid they would vote for the party as their first preferencea snap election was held.The poll puts the party % ahead of its nearest challengers, the DUP and Alliance, both on %.Sinn Fein#s support has increased % from our last poll in January, while the DUP has fallen another %, with the poll conducted between May -, just after Edwin Poots became DUP leader.It will likely prompt big questions for Mr Poots and his UUP counterpart Doug Beattie with a Sinn Fein First Minister long regarded as a devastating psychological blow to unionism.One approach the parties may consider could be a unionist voting pact.While such approaches have had limited success in the past, during the DUP leadership contest Mr Poots said he wanted to hold a unionist convention ahead of the next election to maximise unionist representation.Supporting any pact will be a tough choice for Mr Beattie, his predecessor Steve Aiken#s reign as UUP leader was seriously undermined after he backtracked from a vow to contest all  Westminster seats in the December  General Election to allow Nigel Dodds a solo unionist run in North Belfast.TUV leader Jim Allister has already expressed his support for unionist parties to work together toas many anti-Northern Ireland Protocol MLAs as possible.Our poll makes better reading for Mr Beattie and Mr Allister, with the UUP up % to % and the TUV up % to %.While the Alliance Party remain in the race to become Northern Ireland#s second biggest party, there are suggestions their popularity may be waning slightly with a drop in support from -%.However, % would still be a massive result for the party who polled just .% in the  Assembly election.Despite respondents finding SDLP leader Colum Eastwood Northern Ireland#s second most competent political leader, and a young Assembly team, the party continue to struggle to make headway with voters.Our poll now has the SDLP behind the UUP and just ahead of the TUV with % of the vote. The party has fallen % from our January poll, but remains just ahead of its .%  Assembly election result.Extensive rebuilding work in the last few years appears unable to entice new voters, but the party continues to maintain its loyal base.The Greens, People Before Profit and others and independents all sit on % of the vote. How the polling was carried outPolling was carried out online from .pm on May  to pm on May , targeting the established Northern Ireland LucidTalk online opinion  , and which is balanced to be demographically representative of Northern Ireland. Some , full responses were received, and these were ‘weighted down’ to a , NI representative data-set used for analysis in terms of the final results. Data was weighted by age, sex, socio-economic group, previous voting patterns, constituency, constitutional position, party support, and religious affiliation.

Donegal.Joe Dunne FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSenator Niall Blaney at his home in Rosnakill, Co. Donegal.Fionnan SheahanMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailIt’s a pretty celebrated farmyard. Steeped in republicanism, all the Blaney family history leads from here. Neal Blaney was commander of the IRA in Donegal in the War of Independence and Civil War. Seán Lemass came here to visit him after the war, meeting his four-year-old son, Neil T Blaney.Young Neil would go on to succeed his father as the local Fianna Fáil TD and serve in Mr Lemass’s Cabinet  years later. Neil would later be sacked from Cabinet by Mr Lemass’s successor as Fianna Fáil leader and Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, for his role in the much-disputed arms crisis and a plot to import weapons for nationalists in Northern Ireland, after what subsequently became known as the Troubles broke out in .He set up the legendary Independent Fianna Fáil. After his death, he was succeeded by his brother Harry, whose son, Niall, also held the seat and ultimately rejoined Fianna Fáil.Now a Senator, Niall woke up the sleepy Seanad this week when he criticised the lack of media coverage on alleged Sinn Féin activities in Derry, including misuse of public funds and criminality in the republican movement.“The legacy of former deputy first minister, the late Martin McGuinness, has been torn apart. What is the problem with the media in this country that they are afraid to report these things  There are all kinds of rumours in Derry of community monies not being properly spent. There are also rumours of drugs being involved. It is in everybody’s interests that the media report these things,” he said in the Seanad, under parliamentary privilege.Mr Blaney also referred to Gerry Adams’s brother, Liam Adams, the convicted paedophile who died two years ago: “Gerry Adams’s brother was placed in a Donegal house for three years and had charges of paedophilia made against him. No media would ever touch that story. Everyone knew about it in Donegal but nobody would touch it.”The Senator said Sinn Féin was “spending tens of thousands of euro week in, week out” on newspapers, media and journalists across the country and “they can attack anybody on social media with the drop of an email”. “Our democracy is under attack,” he said.Sinn Féin’s support continues to grow. Given the disjointed handling of the housing crisis by the Coalition, Mary Lou McDonald has every chance of becoming Taoiseach. A political party on the brink of power, or in power, will rightly come under the spotlight. Yet the party continually finds itself being accused of not acting like normal democratic parties. Scrutiny is met with a culture of omerta.The focus on Derry is quite pointed. Since Martin McGuinness’s death four years ago, Sinn Féin has lost ground in Derry with a sense the party has fallen out of favour with its republican base. Ms McDonald carried out a review of Sinn Féin, the organisation and wider republican movement in Derry, including families of Provisional IRA members.On foot of the report, the party leadership has stood down officials and public representatives, controversially including Northern Ireland Assembly members Martina Anderson and Karen Mullan, who will not be running in the next election.The secret report has not been published and no explanation has been provided for the reason behind the purge. Away from Leinster House and back up in the farmyard on the Fanad Peninsula, Mr Blaney explained the motivation behind his comments. He says Sinn Féin needs to publish its report.“They absolutely should be making that public. What political party in a democracy goes in and stands people down. An organisation should be selecting their own candidate by popular vote. That’s how most parties operate. That’s how they usually operate in a democracy. There’s a whole lot of secrecy. What’s it about ” he says.“These things need investigation. The public need to know who they are voting for and what they are voting for,” he added.Republican politics is in his blood but he regularly talks to members of the Protestant community on both sides of the Border and to loyalists in Northern Ireland.“I wasn’t around in the Troubles and the Arms Trial period in ’ and ’. I was around when my father, then a councillor, was heavily involved in organising the protests in relation to the H-Block and the hunger strikers in Donegal. Sinn Féin didn’t exist back then on the ground, apart from a few they were a non-entity.“Now you have these people claiming to be the great republicans and throwing out material in relation to hunger strikers, Bobby Sands and rest of it, when they had little or nothing to do with the election in Cavan-Monaghan.“For me, my sense of republicanism has more to do with looking after everybody on the island, that’s the proper sense of republicanism. Not this dogmatic driving your ideas down everybody’s throat and doing whatever it takes to get your way, by coercion or whatever other means. That’s not republicanism. They are not republicans. Sometimes it sticks in my throat to hear these people call themselves republican, when they are not. If they are truly democratic,they are republican, it’s time they started acting that way.”From his discussions with unionists in the North, Mr Blaney feels it is too early to be talking about a united Ireland and we need to do an awful lot more to understand the views of people on the other side in Northern Ireland. “I’m not a fan of putting anything on the table before we get people to the table.”Separately this week, in Westminster, at the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, DUP MP Gregory Campbell said there were allegations of criminal activity regarding community associations and groups, which he has passed to the Police Service of Northern Ireland .“A week ago I wrote to the Chief Constable about allegations of illegality amongst community associations in republican areas where Sinn Féin members are involved and my understanding is that there may well be a connection between that and a recent investigation by Sinn Féin which has resulted in two Sinn Féin MLAs being asked to stand down from the Stormont Assembly,” he told the Commons committee under parliamentary privilege. “I haven’t got a response yet from the Chief Constable. I’ve yet to hear Sinn Féin’s response to these allegations of illegality in their community.”Sinn Féin has rejected the allegations of any wrongdoing.Sinn Féin MLA Gerry Kelly, who is overseeing the implementation of the internal party review in Derry, attacked what he called the “grossly defamatory” allegations against the Foyle MLAs, Ms Anderson and Ms Mullan.He challenged Mr Blaney and Mr Campbell to “stop hiding behind parliamentary privilege and abusing it to make unfounded and scurrilous allegations”.“There is absolutely no basis to scurrilous allegations made in recent days by Niall Blaney and Gregory Campbell about Sinn Féin’s MLAs Karen Mullan and Martina Anderson in Foyle,” he said. Ms Anderson and Ms Mullan have threatened legal actionthe allegations are repeated outside of parliament.“Over the past few days a number of politicians have sought, under privilege, to blacken our names and characters by linking us to alleged illegal activity.The assertions that we were asked to stand down as MLAs because we were involved in any kind of illegal activity is absolutely outrageous.As dedicated Irish republicans we cannot allow these scurrilous allegations to go unchallenged,” they said.However, Sinn Féin has not published the review nor given a satisfactory explanation for party officials in Derry being stood down. Sinn Féin has also used parliamentary privilege to put allegations on the public record.Six years ago, Ms McDonald was found to have abused parliamentary privilege by naming six former politicians as being accused of alleged tax evasion by holding Ansbacher Bank accounts.Notably, Mr Blaney didn’t name either Sinn Féin nor any members of the party and his allegations appeared to be directed at the wider republican movement.In one of the more considered speeches on the Ballymurphy Inquest, Sinn Féin TD Pa Daly linked the lack of public awareness of the massacre of  innocent people to a “whitewash of silence”.He pointed out the State censorship of the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin resulted in campaigners for Ballymurphy, the Dublin and Monaghan bombing and the Birmingham Six being “labelled as fellow travellers”“Going back to Section  of the Broadcasting Act, the political programming that was offered by journalists in this State led to a narrative that ultimately served no purpose at all. The people who went further than what was required in the Broadcasting Act silenced campaigners who were campaigning against injustice. Those campaigners were labelled as fellow travellers,” he said.Section  has lapsed. The Provisional IRA has gone away. The party has entered democratic politics.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He waves a cursory greeting and continues on his way. In the time it takes me to gather everything I need together, he passes me again, his step count no doubt rising with every lap of the town. Zoom. Walk. Laptop. Bake. Netflix. Repetition has become endemic over the last year, but its something Moneymore cant be accused of. There is a unique feel to the fronts of the buildings that greet me as I walk around the town. Even the post office, now boarded up, remains unbranded. googletag.cmd.push Moneymores terrain gives the town a layered effect. The pillared entrance of The Manor House provides the backdrop to the towns mini roundabout, welcoming motorists coming down the hill from Smith Street. Rusty scaffolding frames a construction site on my left as I make my way down. A woman waters potted plants in her compact front garden. The distinctive smell of curry is emanating from the two Chinese restaurants at the bottom of the hill. Shutters are down on Antonios pizza, yet to open for the day. More scaffolding sits alongside buildings in mid-construction off High Street, but no work appears to be going on today. googletag.cmd.push Along Lawford Street there are ersion signs in place as Council staff busy themselves in resurfacing the Turnaface Road. The grating sound of the road roller echoes off the houses that line the street leading back to the town centre. You could describe Moneymore as ornate. Older, unique buildings, set at dferent levels, create a layered backdrop, crowned by the spire of St John and St Treas church on the top of the hill.  The hum of a small aircraft passing overhead and the unmistakable smell of freshly-cut grass adds to the sense of a town taking new-found pleasure in the mundane.     A pregnant sky threatens rain. Taken a dip I nip into The Mane Barber Shop, where a neon sign declares the shop open for business. Owner Pauline McGarvey is at her lunch. She says reopening has not been the silver bullet the industry was hoping for. “This week has been terrible. For the first seven days [after reopening] it was great, but its taken a dip again,” she tells me. “The older folk that keep you going – your pensioners and farmers and that during the day – they havent been about the same. A vintage tractor model welcomes visitors to the town from the Tyrone side. “It was a gamble coming into a small town. You do have a bit of passing trade but youre hoping people are going to come in from the likes of Coagh, Lissan and Loup. “I said I would give it six months and see how it turns. Its fine, but its not busy. You have that fear of whether its going to come back.” Pauline has been in Moneymore three years, and until the pandemic ruthlessly attacked all businesses, things had been going well.  has seen a seismic change across all industries, driving many hair and beauty professionals off the high street altogether. “Lots of people are working from home and I have to admit, Im tempted,” she says. “Youre still going to be hit with rates, and you havent stopped paying your water bill, your electricity, your rent. “Yes, we got a bit of help, butyouve no customers in, then that money is all going to go and you still have to find wages too. “Ive seen a lot of hair and beauty people who havent gone back from the first lockdown.” Humanity adapts though, and over the last year, Pauline has embraced the situation in which the world found itself. She got married in February, and has enjoyed the extra time with her family. Keeping an eye on litter in the area. “It was the first time in my le I could actually say I was a mummy. I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, last year a large number of people put their name to a petition objecting to a bid for a coal screening operation on the site. The site has now been placed on the market. Although zoned as ‘white land’ the fuel yard could have development potential, particularly with the progress on the nearby Fort George site. The Department for Communities decision to sell part of the site to the Western Trust in March marked the latest step in the ambitious project. googletag.cmd.push The land on the river front of the Bay Road coal yard was also recently acquired for the new cross border cycle network, which will include a new pedestrian and cycle bridge across the Pennyburn Inlet.

The Derry News has learned that Home Bargains is keen on opening a new outlet on the large Waterside site. The Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre site was put up for sale last year by its owners Derry City and Strabane District Council with an asking price of pound,. It is understood that there was strong interest in the site from potential buyers. However, the council has confirmed that a preferred bidder has been approved by the councils Business and Culture Committee. That decision will now need to be ratied at the councils full monthly meeting later this month before the final details of the sale can be processed. googletag.cmd.push While all those involved in the sale of the key Waterside site are remaining tight-lipped, the Derry News understands that the preferred bidder would see Home Bargains opening a new store on the site. This would involve the demolition of the former leisure centre building and the construction of the new store. The Derry News contacted Home Bargains, who already have a store at Strand Road in Derry, about their plans for further expansion in the city. However, a spokesperson for the company said they were not able to comment at this time. A spokesperson for the local council said a report was brought before the Business and Culture Committee last week in confidential business seeking members approval for the appointment of the preferred bidder for the purchase and development of the Lisnagelvin site. googletag.cmd.push “This decision will come before Full Council for full ratication at the end of the month,” the spokesperson said. “Once ratied Councils legal services team will engage with the successful bidder to commence legal formalities for the disposal and development of the site in accordance with the Conditions of Sale set out in the tender documents.” ​Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre closed several years ago. The leisure centre was hugely popular with generations of young people in the city, especially because of its swimming pool and its famous wave machine. Since being closed, the building has been empty and there has been much debate about the future use of the large site.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Chauvin was recently found guilty of second-degree murder and is awaiting sentenced.

The event schedule includes the launch of an online book of remembrance and an online memorial service that is taking place on May  from .pm to pm. googletag.cmd.push The service will be live-streamed through the NWMF Facebook page. Confirmed guest speakers for the memorial service include: Bishop of Derry Donal McKeown Dr Umar Al-Qadir, chair of the Irish Muslim Peace and Integration Council Colum Eastwood, leader of the SDLP andBrian Tierney, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council. NWMF is also asking members of the public to light a candle at .pm after the online memorial service and display it on their windows in memory of Mr Floyd. They are then encouraged to share a photo of their candle on social media, tagging the NWMF and using the hashtag #uniteaganistracism. googletag.cmd.push Lilian Seenoi-Barr, Director of Programmes at the North West Migrants Forum, said: “It’s hard to believe that it has been a year since the brutal murder of George Floyd in America, a tragedy that should never have happened. “We must continue to work together to stamp out racism and hold accountable the structures and systems that have allowed such heinous acts to continue to occur. “This includes the PSNI and the NI executive just as much as the powers that be in USA.

The young defender scored after just three minutes at the RSC, heading in a Will Patching free kick from close range, and that proved to be enough for the Candystripes. City were completely dominant in the first half, but it was a dferent story in the second half, although Waterford ultimately lacked the quality to take any of the half chances which came their way. It took just three minutes for Derry City to take the lead, doing so with their first attack. Goalkeeper Brian Murphy needlessly raced from his area and fouled James Akintunde in the corner, gting the visitors a free kick. Patching delivered the ball into the near post where Boyce rose to head in the opening goal from close range. googletag.cmd.push The Candystripes dominated the opening stages of the game and it should have been - on  minutes when Patching ran at the Waterford defence before curling an effort at goal which Murphy could only parry straight into the path of Akintunde. The forward opted not to shoot first time however, trying to take it around the goalkeeper, but Murphy did enough to turn Akintunde away from the goal and the chance was gone. It took Waterford  minutes before they tested Nathan Gartside at the other end, and it was a big moment in the first half as the Derry goalkeeper was at his best to keep out Shane Grfin’s free kick from  yards. Grfin, who scored from a similar position earlier in the season at the Brandywell, tried his luck again, but this time Gartside was equal, ing to his right to push the ball behind for a corner. googletag.cmd.push Waterford were much livelier at the start of the second half and they could have gone level when Jamie Mascoll’s cross picked out Adam O’Reilly completely unmarked in the area, but he got his header all wrong and failed to even test Gartside. City did not enjoy anywhere near the same dominance in the second half, as Waterford played a high pressing game, which made the players in red and white very uncomfortable. They were very early caught out by a Mascell free kick on  minutes, as John Martin crept free to the back post, but he was unable to bring the ball under control and the chance was again gone.     That was as good as it got through for the home side as Derry head out to pick up a valuable three points away from home.  Teams Waterford: Brian Murphy, Darragh Power, Cameron Evans, Josh Collins, Shane Grfin, Adam O’Reilly, James Waite, John Martin, Niall O’Keefe, Jamie Mascoll, Eric Molloy . Derry City: Nathan Gartside, Ciaran Coll, Eoin Toal, Cameron McJannett, Ronan Boyce, Ciaron Harkin, Joe Thomson , Will Fitzgerald , Will Patching, James Akintunde, Patrick Ferry .

The OATS Project - Orienteering, Athletics and Triathlon Stars, is an exciting programme aimed at introducing young people to a new sport, or bringing them back to sport after the restrictions of the pandemic. The programme launches this Sunday, May , and is being funded by Sport NI as part of the Project Re-Boot Build Back Better initiative. It will run over the next four weeks at St. Columb’s Park in what is expected to be the first of four seasonal events of its kind. googletag.cmd.push Project Manager Bridgeen Byrne, of City of Derry Spartans AC, explains that the event will host up to  local kids, aged from -, with the emphasis being on fun. We’re doing four programmes - spring, summer, autumn, winter – and the first is this Sunday,” she said. “It will be four consecutive Sundays where three groups of  kids will rotate between the three sports of orienteering, athletic and triathlon. They will be introduced to these sports in a fun environment where they can meet dferent people from other schools. “The emphasis is on fun and enjoyment and getting back outdoors, getting active and meeting new people. It will be skills-based throughout, from the three sports to communication, working together as a team and even healthy eating.” googletag.cmd.push  Support The OATS Project has received the backing of Derry City  Strabane District Council, a number of schools in the city on both sides of the community, the British Orienteering Federation and Athletics Northern Ireland. There will be qualied coaches in every sport as well as A-Level P.E students from local schools who have volunteered to help the coaches roll out the programme. Getting back outside after a frustrating year for everyone is the aim of the project, with Bridgeen hoping to really give local kids a boost after a dficult  months. “Getting outside for that endorphin release, getting fresh air and being out with nature. These are all ways we can better our well-being to get ourselves back,” she added.     “We’re super excited about making the project a reality. It grew from a tiny little seed to this huge event that’s going to take up with full year with spring, summer, autumn and winter programmes. “Some young people haven’t had the opportunities they would usually have in the past year – they haven’t been able to do the things they would be able to do or meet the people they would be able to meet in and around school. This gives them the opportunity to get out and do dferent things and meet dferent people and they could be friends for le then.” Well-being This Sunday will be the first steps for the OATS project but Byrne is hoping that dferent organisations can continue to work together beyond this year, with the physical and mental well-being of young people the most important aspect of all. “It’s a one-year project but we would like to grow it beyond that,” she admitted. “It encourages clubs to work together. You are learning all the time, you are concentrating, you are outdoors in the environment. It’s really good and it will make young people far more aware of their surroundings, when they are outside especially with orienteering because you will be looking at nature far more, and you will be looking after your space. All the spaces around Derry are beautul now and we will be using dferent spaces around the town throughout the year. “In the last couple of years we have run two well-being programmes, and during lockdown we worked with Action Mental Health who ran three programmes for us. Because of lockdown we were concerned with how young people were feeling so we had programmes for three dferent age groups. “We’re always trying to look after the well-being of the young people and trying to get them to come outdoors, and encourage them to participate in sport. Once you’re involved with sport, everything  will work better – it will hep you academically, it will help family le, and help when you’re outside meeting people.” Anyone interested in participating this Sunday is asked to contact Bridgeen on  or by emailing bridgeen@aol.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

That was the last we heard from him.ldquoI was listening to the news all afternoon to hearthere was anything happening. It wasnrsquot until pm that night when I was listening to the RTE news that I heard a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy.Mr Mullan knew in his gut that it was his brother, but could not bring himself to tell his parents, John and Mary.ldquoAll that was said that he was shot, it didnrsquot say he was dead. He was actually dead within  minutes of being shot, he continued.ldquoWe were phoned around am and I found out he was dead. I called the doctor just in case my mother would get badly upset and she was badly upset after the doctor told her. I couldnrsquot bring myself to tell her.ldquoMy father was up the stairs and couldnrsquot come down the stairs but he knew it was bad news.Mr Mullan said it took the Ballymurphy families a few years to organise in order to campaign for truth and justice as a  inquest recorded an open verdict in all the deaths.He has been involved with the campaign for a new inquest for over  years, travelling to Dublin and Brussels and beyond on order to plead the familiesrsquo case.Mr Mullan, his niece Geraldine McGrattan and son Hugh had been regular attenders over the  days the inquest was held.The family, including Mr Mullanrsquos late sister Teresa, lived for a time on the Strand, beside the Portaferry Hotel.While Mr Mulllan took after his father and spent his working le fishing, Fr Mullan spent a year in the Merchant Navy before opting to go to Queenrsquos University and then Maynooth College to train to be a priest.He served for a time at St Josephrsquos Church in Killough before moving to Dunloy for nine years. While his funeral was held in Belfast, he was buried in St Patrickrsquos graveyard in Portaferry.ldquoHugh baptised all my family, he married me and my we Mary, so he was very close to us all, said Mr Mullan.He recalled how his brother loved to sail in Strangford Lough and entertain his family or parishioners by singing along to his guitar.But most of all, Mr Mullan mourns what his brother could have done for others.ldquoHugh was the type of priest who needed to be among people all the time, helping people, he said.ldquoHe was someone who would have given anyone anything he had, even his last penny. He particularly liked to help young people and loved working and encouraging them.ldquoIf he had have got a chance in Ballymurphy, he would have helped the people no end to help themselves. Thatrsquos what he aimed to do with people and was always thinking of dferent things that he could start.Mr Mullan thanked everybody who had called him or send cards over the week and in particular, local priest, Fr Feargal McGrady, for his help and support over the years.Mr Mullanrsquos granddaughter, Mairead OrsquoHare, added: ldquoThese families have fought so tirelessly over the years to get justice for their loved ones, it has been both inspiring and heartbreaking to watch.ldquoI never met my great-uncle, but the stories my Granda tells regularly make his presence known and you can easily tell that the love my Granda has for his brother has never ceased.ldquoHe has known for the last  years that his brother was innocent, he didnrsquot need a coronerrsquos ruling to know that, but having Fr Mullan declared innocent to the entire world has brought much needed comfort and peace..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-World.jpg","title":"‘World knows Hugh was innocent’  ","story":"THE family of Ballymurphy Massacre victim Fr Hugh Mullan have welcomed a coronerrsquos ruling that he was an innocent ldquopeacemaker.The Portaferry priest was shot dead by soldiers as he tended to a wounded man on waste ground in west Belfast on August  .Fr Mullan and nine others shot dead were all exonerated in an inquest ruling by a coroner last week.At the time the Army reported that the nine men and one woman who died were Republican gunmen killed in crossfire.The first to die over the three days of shooting, Fr Mullan had only served a a church for seven months.Mrs Justice Keegan said in her findings that he was ldquounarmed, not acting in any way as a threat, attending to a wounded man in the field and waving a white object as a sign of his peaceful intentions.ldquoHe died as a result of gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen. The shooting of the deceased has not been justied by the State. The use of force by the Army that resulted in his death was disproportionate.Fr Mullanrsquos youngest brother, Patsy, said that he and the rest of his family always knew the  year-old priest was innocent.Now , he said the first learnt something was wrong when he heard that a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy that day on the RTE late news.ldquoI knew right away it would be him, he was the type of person and would be out to help anyone in trouble or who was injured. That was just his nature. Unfortunately it was his downfall, said Mr Mullan, who still lives in Portaferry.ldquoHugh was the type of priest who would have been among people all the time, helping people.ldquoHe was someone who would have given anyone anything he had, even his last penny.Mr Mullan was left unimpressed with an apology that Prime Minister Boris Johnston made in a call to former First Minister Arlene Foster.ldquoI wouldnrsquot have wanted an apology from him actually. I donrsquot have much time for him at the best of times because I donrsquot think hersquos the best person for that job.Mr Mullan, his niece Geraldine McGrattan, his son Hugh and other family members attended nearly all  days the inquest since it started in November .Mrs McGrattan said that hearing the judgersquos findings ldquolted a weight of me.ldquoIrsquove known for the past  years that Hugh was innocent but now the world knows, she said.ldquoTo hear him call him a peacemaker was very touching. It was as though that I had been coiled up in a tight spring and suddenly just released.

This means that plastic litter in the sea is just adding up and, globally, we are adding a truck load full every minute, she continued.ldquoThat is a lot of plastic and, on top of looking bad, it is harmful to sea plants and animals. Every year, plastic kills , sea animals and over a million sea birds. It is a big problem.During last weekrsquos launch event in Ardglass, a number of fishermen told Jenny how sad they were to see how much litter is in the sea and that they have noticed an increase in the amount of it in during their letimes.ldquoIt also takes their valuable time at sea to clear from their nets and can potentially contaminate their catch, so the new scheme is a win-win for them to do their part in getting rid of it.Describing the new project as ldquoinnovative, Jenny said it has already been successful where with fishermen bringing marine litter caught in their nets back to shore.She said the Harbour Authority provides durable bags for the litter to be collected in and that once landed onshore, it is sent off to be recycled or otherwise disposed of.ldquoThis is how our fishermen in Northern Ireland are reducing the marine plastic problem at sea, Jenny explained. ldquoThe thing that makes this project so unique is that fishermen are almost the only people who have access to litter that is out in the open water or at the seabed.ldquoStopping waste entering the sea is imperative, but taking litter out of the sea is too, even though it is more challenging. That is exactly what lsquofishing for litterrsquo fishermen do.Jenny praised the fishermen in Ardglass who have signed up to the scheme as did local councillor, Dermot Curran.ldquoThis is a great scheme and anything which can help reduce the amount of marine litter being washed ashore is to be welcomed, he said.ldquoTen Ardglass skippers have already signed up for the scheme and I hope that there will be more. This is a great new initiative but we also have to look at how litter gets into the sea in the first place which poses problems for trawler skippers as this waste gets tangled up in their nest which is time-consuming and a distraction they could well do without, he said.ldquoThe Fishery Harbour Authority is to be congratulated for bringing this initiative to the Co Down ports and the more skippers that sign up for lsquofishing for litterrsquo the better. The scheme can help protect the environment and reduce the amount of unsightly litter being washed up along the shoreline..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business support programme helps secure 78 jobs in district  ","story":"A COUNCIL-LED local business support programme has created  jobs in the last  months.According to new figures released, the Business Growth and Tender for Growth programmes facilitated by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council have helped to create an average of one new job each week.The programmes are part-funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern Irelandprogramme.Despite the impact of recent lockdowns over the last  months, NMD Business has continued to provide SMEs with support packages in response to challenges created by the pandemic.This has resulted in ongoing growth for the business and the creation of  new job roles, as well as helping  businesses involved in the programme to navigate an unprecedented economic environment.Participants in the programme are able to avail of one-to-one mentoring from leading experts, who help guide them and their business through unprecedented times, as well as learning new skills in financial management, cross-border sales and maximising your chances of winning tenders.As a result, many businesses have been able to not only grow their business, but grow their workforce.Sara Velasquez, from Ecoplastic in Downpatrick, completed the programme last year and has already recruited four new staff for the business.Her firm designs and makes all kinds of structures from % recycled material, from boardwalks to street furniture, bridges to bike trails and picnic tables.She said: ldquoThe NMD Business programme helped us focus on the most lucrative areas for growth for our business.ldquoOur dedicated mentor provided us with expert guidance which allowed us to respond quickly to a new market environment, giving us confidence that decisions we were taking were anchored in good commercial sense, while the workshops equipped us with new skills that will stand us in good stead into the future.ldquoSales have since increased as a result and we continue to work on exciting projects across Ireland and the UK.

However, both batsmen fell in the th over to the bowling of C Allen .Dundrum lost a further two wickets in the following over to the bowling of N Pinkerton . This left Dundrum - in the sixteenth over and looking atthe possibility of posting a below par score.Stephen Campbell and Dave Crudgington added  vital runs for the final wicket to take Dundrum to  for nine from their  overs.

It was a four-lap course which started at Greenisland Golf Club and carried on via Monkstown Wood, Shore Road and then a bit of a challenge with a hill to contend with on Station Road.The weather was grey with a little drizzle but nothing to cause major problems and in fact Declan felt that there was a slight wind assistance on the climb which was welcome.The overall winner Chris Denton, was the only runner to break three hours and he took top spot on the podium with a time of two hours and  minutes.Declan was more than happy with his own time of . and the fact that he placed seventh overall.

A number have also been vandalised.Councillors will be told tonight that a decision is required to repair, replace or remove these particular units and they will be provided with a detailed breakdown of the work that is required.Toilets at Castlewellanrsquos Upper Square need to be replaced while the outer shell of the building would remain in place, while the existing facility at Market Street in Downpatrick would be entirely replaced.The new strategy suggests that the current public toilets at The Rocks in Ballyhornan would be replaced as would existing toilets at the local authority-owned car park at the Newcastle Road outside Dundrum.Plans have also been drawn up to replace toilets at Crossgarrsquos Lislea Drive and at Ardglass harbour, while public toilets at the New Line in Saintfield mdash which have been repeatedly targeted by vandals mdash would replaced, alongside those at the Quoile Road in Downpatrick.Public toilets the Lough Inch cemetery in Ballynahinch and Struell Cemetery in Downpatrick are also in line for refurbishment under the new council strategy, alongside conveniences at Windmill Street in Ballynahinch.It will also be confirmed at tonightrsquos council meeting that almost  people responded to a -week consultation on the new strategy with over  percent of those who responded agreeing with the suggestion to pay to spend a penny. Concern was also expressed about the cleanliness of some public toilets and their layout.And while council toilets in Newcastle, Dundrum, Castlewellan, Downpatrick, Ballyhornan and Ardglass have reopened after being closed due to coronavirus, those in Saintfield, Ballynahinch, Crossgar and Killyleagh remain closed. They are due to reopen shortly.Cllr Billy Walker has welcomed the decision to reopen council toilets across the Rowallane area and said the fact that these particular public conveniences have been closed or over a year was ldquounacceptable.He said steps should have been taken earlier to ensure that staff were available to open and maintain the ious facilities.Cllr Walker was particularly critical of the decision to keep toilets in Killyleagh closed given the number of people who visited the town over recent months as Covid restrictions eased.ldquoPublic toilets across the Rowallane area were closed too long for my liking and I am aware that there was concern that conveniences at the townrsquos Market House and nearby community centre were also closed, he continued.ldquoI have been informed that all public toilets across the district will be reopened by June and that is welcome news. With the further easing of lockdown restrictions there will be an increase in the number of visitors to the area and it is vital that all conveniences are available..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Success.jpg","title":"Success for young stars in virtual competition  ","story":"PUPILS from Mourne Stars Speech and Drama in Newcastle have been celebrating success once again.Many pupils from Clare Murninrsquos classes took part in Newry Feis this year as they usually would have done previous years.This year was a little dferent. With the recent lockdown they didnrsquot get to stand on the stage at Newry Town Hall. Instead it was a virtual competition where pupils sent in video recordings of their poetry recitals.All of the pupils used excellent vocal skills showing wonderful confidence in all age categories.ldquoThe Newry Feis is a wonderful opportunity for the pupils of speech and drama to show off everything they learn in class, for example, proper use of tone, pause, pace, pitch, projection, volume and articulation skills, Clare explained.She said she was proud of every one of her pupils who entered the competitions and thanks all of the parents for their unwavering support.She also said she was delighted to see so many of the pupils be awarded within their age categories, which she described as an excellent tribute to the hard work they all put in.If you are interested in your son or daughter taking part in speech and drama contact Clare via email mournestars@gmail or follow Mourne Stars Speech and Drama on Facebook and Instagram..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Tally.jpg","title":"Tally’s men lose out to Mayo stars in opener  ","story":"DOWN senior footballers did not have their fairytale start back in Division  after being comprehensively beaten by a strong Mayo side.It was always going to be an uphill battle for Paddy Tallyrsquos team as they faced off against a recently demoted Mayo outfit in Castlebar.Despite last yearrsquos relegation, Mayo began their campaign with strong intent and although the Mourne county could not be faulted for lack of heart, it was soon clear it was the home sidersquos game to lose.Down started admirably, matching Mayo for the first  minutes as the sides scored four points a piece.However, it wouldnrsquot be long before Tommy Conroy would open the goal scoring as he rapidly burst through the Down defence to place the ball under goalkeeper Rory Burns.Down showed they would not go without a fight and chalked up a couple more points to bring the scores - to - at the half-time interval.The game was perhaps put completely beyond the red and black outfitrsquos reach when Mayo fired home another goal on the  minute-mark.A consolation goal from Down substitute Stephen McConville allowed for a more modest scoreline but evidently, it was clear that this Mayo side will no doubt be pushing for ato the top tier.Down manager Paddy Tally reflected on his teamrsquos performance after the full-time whistle.ldquoI felt, at times, we just didnrsquot get to the intensity of the game, he said. ldquoTo be honest, it was always going to be a wee bit of fun coming here today to see where the boys are at.Itrsquos a bit freaky, a team like Mayo being in Division Two. Naturally there would be a bit of a gap in experience and quality.Mayo manager James Horan was delighted with his teamrsquos effort as he looks ahead to a promising campaign.ldquoSix or seven sessions is all wersquove had so we were very unsure because we just didnrsquot know where we would be, he said.ldquoThe guys, you could see there, did a huge amount of work inidually over the winter. They were in very good shape and quickly got up to speed, he continued.ldquoWe got sloppy towards the end but overall we were very happy with today.Down now look ahead to the weekend when they face off against Meath following their win over Westmeath.Mayo: R Hennelly E Hession, O Mullin , L Keegan M Plunkett , P Durcan, R Brickenden M Ruane , D OrsquoConnorF McDonagh , K McLoughlin, J FlynnT Conroy , C OrsquoConnor , R OrsquoDonoghue .Subs used: E McLaughlinfor Brickenden, B Walsh for FlynnC Loftus for McDonaghS Coen for McLoughlin, A Orme for OrsquoDonoghue , J McCormack for D OrsquoConnor , C Boyle for Keegan .Down: R Burns G Collins, G McGovern, P Murdock K McKernan, P Laverty, J Flynn R McEvoy, C Mooney J Guinness , C Poland, C Doherty D Guinness , C Quinn , B OrsquoHagan .Subs used: L Kerrfor DohertyO McCabe for PolandD OrsquoHagan for McKernanP Devlinfor McKernan, L Middleton for Quinn, S McConvillefor McEvoyB McArdle for Murdock Mayo -Down -NFL DIVISION .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Tohear.jpg","title":"To hear Hugh was a ‘peacemaker’ was very touching  ","story":"GERALDINE McGrattan was  and away on a holiday in Tralee when she first heard that her beloved uncle, Fr Hugh Mullan, had been shot dead in Ballymurphy in Belfast on August , .The tragic news was confirmed to her grandparents, John and Mary Mullan, around am the following day.Her mother Teresa, Hughrsquos eldest sister, was pregnant at the time and Geraldine could not wait to get home to Portaferry.ldquoGranny was distraught, I arrived home late on the Tuesday evening as it took so long and to get through the Newry border checkpoint, she recalled.ldquoIt was so unbelievable, I picked up a paper in Dublin to read what had happened. My uncle was the first to be shot, then Frank Quinn, the  year-old, who was shot beside him and killed.What hurt Geraldine and the wider Mullan family so much was in press reports Fr Mullan was said to have been involved in a gun battle with soldiers.ldquoHe was such a big part of our family le, for the lies that were told about him were very dficult for us all, she said. ldquoIt was hard enough to lose him, but to lose him like that and then everything afterward was so hard.She said on that fateful day, her uncle had been trying all day to calm things down.ldquoThere was trouble from Loyalists behind Springfield Park and the people in Springfield Park started to evacuate their houses and tried to flee across a piece of waste ground over to Moyard to safety.ldquoBricks and stones were being thrown at their houses and houses were badly damaged. They were carrying children across the waste ground and firing started. A man, Bobby Clarke, was shot and wounded in a field and local people called for a priest as they thought he was going to die.ldquoUncle Hugh had been standing outside his own house and had spent the day ringing the Army, trying to get thing quietened and calmed. He called the Army to tell them that he was going out to the wasteland to help an injured man. Then he got a white cloth, began to wave it and went out onto the wasteland.ldquoHe got to Bobby and he told Uncle Hugh he wasnrsquot too bad. Uncle Hugh said he would go and get him an ambulance but would give him the Anointing of the Sick to help him anyway.ldquoHe did that and he was making his way back to get an ambulance when he was shot. He was shot at least twice and left in the field. Frank Quinn went out to help Uncle Hugh and he was shot and died instantly.The family never received any official explanation about Fr Mullanrsquos death.ldquoIn the early days, we were told that Uncle Hugh had been killed in crossfire during a gun battle, said Mrs McGrattan. ldquoNewspapers reported that he was a gunman, carrying a weapon. No one ever contacted us, there was never a person at the door to tell us what had happened.Along with the joy from last Tuesday of the coronerrsquos ruling that Fr Mullan was an innocent, Mrs McGrattan said there was also a lot of sadness for her.ldquoIt was a sad day as my grandparents, John and Mary, werenrsquot there to hear it, nor were my parents, Teresa and Gerry, my husband Gerard and my brother Hugh Kearney. So many of us have died in those  years and didnrsquot get to hear the good words she used.There was another loss for her family mdash her mother Teresarsquos baby died at birth and her parents moved to England shortly afterwards.Mrs McGrattan said she was really moved to hear the testimonies of civilian witnesses who gave evidence during the inquest.ldquoWhenever Mrs Justice Keegan said that Hughrsquos story was stark and in her opinion, he was a peacemaker, and totally innocent, it lted a weight off me.ldquoIrsquove known for the past  years that Hugh was innocent but now the world knows. To hear him call him a peacemaker was very touching. It was though that I had been coiled up in a tight spring and suddenly just released. It was a great day.She praised and thanked the Portaferry community for their support over the years.ldquoThe people of Portaferry were so generous and so kind to the whole family at that time, actually all through the years.

It is celebrated on Sunday, May .In their joint message, the bishops opened by quoting a verse from the book of Acts in the Bible: \"All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability - Acts :.\"They continued: \"One of the great marks of the first Pentecost was the ability the Holy Spirit gave the apostles to speak across barriers of language of the works of God.ldquoThe Spirit today gives the people of God the same ability to speak as one across all kinds of barriers and boundaries.ldquoWe rejoice today that we can speak together to both our church communities and beyond with a common message of hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\"Stating their disappointment that for a second year they are unable to mark this \"great feast\" by coming together for their Ecumenical Service of Prayer, as they have done for almost  years, the bishops added: \"This service allows us to give thanks and praise together to God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Please God, next year this might again be possible.\"They continued their message by noting how speaking together about \"the goodness of God\" across barriers is an \"important expression of the language of hope\".They said: \"This is so important as we begin the journey of recovery from the impact of coronavirus. There has been much suffering the loss of loved ones, illness, financial challenge and isolation.ldquoWe all need to hear the healing and strengthening words of Christ, lsquoCome unto me all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you restrsquo.\"Outlining how during the pandemic people quickly realised how important communication is when denied simple non-verbal qualities of close contact and touch, the bishops said: \"We discovered how much we need the warmth of the love of our family and friends.ldquoThe telephone and internet became our key means of keeping in touch and we thank God for these technological aids that kept us connected.ldquoCrucially, we learned how much we are indebted to medical staff, nurses, key workers and volunteers who have communicated dedication, care and love to the community through their skill and acts of kindness.\"We must continue to communicate the language of love and hope across all barriers and boundaries.ldquoIt would be so easy after this long period of restrictions to move to despair and lose hope. Yet we believe there are signs of new le all around us in the vaccination programme and the good response to public health guidance.ldquoLet us encourage one another to communicate the hope that by Godrsquos help, our common le will slowly , and together seek his grace to renew our lives.\"In closing, the bishops said: \"We pray that the Holy Spirit of Pentecost may inspire us so that we communicate in our words and deeds the hope we have in God.ldquoMay we as Christian people speak of our belief in the transforming power of God, and by his Spirit to work together for the rebuilding and re-energising of our churches and society.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ben Lowry says that republicans have for decades known the importance of law, and are using it to secure political, even constitutional, changeIt is why you cannot do things such as smoke until you are , vote until , or, in the US, drink until .It is why safety experts say that young drivers are more likely than older to be reckless until their mid s, when the part of the brain that understands of risk fully develops.When I was a teenager I was keen to get behind the wheel, and I recall being depressed to find that some insurers would not cover drivers under  for faster cars .Respect for age is why you can’t be a US senator until . So while Joel Keys is articulate, I still do not think him a credible witness for MPs. Instead,bright young unionists want to fight republicans, they should get a law degree — as Jamie Bryson is doing.Republicans have for decades known the importance of law.

With top speeds of km per hour, the e-bikes can cover greater distances in less time and with less effort than conventional cycles.E-bike rental costs pound per  minutes for customers with a monthly or annual membership, or pound per  minutes on a pay as you ride basis.The consultation runs until May .

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I think, in a way, therersquos been uncertainties all the way along.ldquoItrsquos always been a sort of provisional timetable and it has to be, or may have to be, adjusted according to events as they occur.ldquoWhen we get to June, whatever happens on that date, this global pandemic will not be over.

Unfortunately, both Sean and his father were thrown from the kayak into the freezing cold water.Sean’s father was washed ashore and despite frantic efforts he was unable to reach his son who was stuck in the water against a wall at the opposite bank. Thankfully a local father and son - Mike Greerand his -year-old son Zachery - were able to pull Sean safely out of the water and alert the emergency services. ]]Due to the severity of the incident, the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service , flown by Air Ambulance Northern Ireland were tasked to the scene along with a number of emergency first response teams.Fortunately Sean has recovered well and as a result of his experience he wanted to do something positive that would potentially help another person who might need the air ambulance in future.Sean’s mum Elaine said, “We wanted to do something that would give back. Air Ambulance NI is a wonderful service that we cannot take for granted. “The service has been tasked to our council area  times in  and it can only help people with donations to support its sustainability. We are so thankful that Sean wanted to do something and that’s him, he has so much grit and determination and we are so proud of him.”Just two months after Sean’s ordeal in the water, both he and his father took on the mighty challenge of summitting Northern Ireland’s highest peak, Slieve Donard to raise funds for the lesaving service. The seven-year-old initially set himself the goal of raising £ but was overwhelmed when his final total came in at £,! His mum said, “Sean is so grateful to every single person who donated to his Just Giving page and helped him smash his target. If the money pays half the fuel or pays towards saving somebody ’s le, it will have been worth it. “Every step Sean took on that mountain really was to help ensure someone  got pre-hospital critical carethey needed it - every penny donated will help that cause.”At the beginning of May, Sean and his family were delighted to be one of the first patient families to visit the air ambulance base with the easing of lockdown restrictions. Sean was delighted to get a tour of the airbase and hear all about how his donation will help others who are potentially in le threatening situations. Mum Elaine commented, “Sean has not stopped talking about his visit to see the air ambulance. He also signed up as a Junior Club member with the charity and so was delighted to wear his branded lanyard and bring along his teddy to get his photo by the helicopter. “He was given a tour, had lots of questions answered and was delighted to hear more about the pilot’s role within the team, as this is something he’s really interested in. “He was also given a copy of the charity newsletter and hasn’t put it down - that’s really helping him with his reading too! We are just so delighted that something that could have turned out to be a devastating situation has had such a positive outcome and we are extremely proud of our young boy who is a big air ambulance fan!”The charity Air Ambulance Northern Ireland, in partnership with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, provides the HEMS for Northern Ireland. The service brings urgent medical assistance to anywhere in the province, operating seven days a week for  hours per day. It can get to anywhere in Northern Ireland in approximately twenty-five minutes.How we reported Sean’s rescue in February - read hereEditor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
