There’s a roaring fire and the place is decorated with quaint, and faintly freaky bric-a-brac (I can see a stuffed cat dressed in a Santa suit).‘I love eccentric London. Eccentric England,’ Patti said happily.She picked the venue, having enjoyed an arvo spread at the Zetter’s sister hotel in Marylebone.Tea isn’t such a big deal in the United States. ‘No, not at all,’ she agreed, before popping a glazed gammon and piccalilli delicacy into her mouth.‘We have breakfast, lunch and dinner. That’s it. How did this happen?!’ she asked as we go on to discuss the rules of taking tea and whether the jam goes on the scone before the cream and how thrilled she’d been, years ago, tasting clotted cream for the first time.‘The jam has to go on first, right? Otherwise you smash the cream?’ she said (she is correct, by the way, in my opinion).The idea for tea with Patti came when Chris Harper, business partner of Company’s celebrated director Marianne Elliott, mentioned in passing that many of the ‘boys’ from Company enjoy popping into the actress’s stage level dressing room.‘What we have are Patti’s Panderings,’ she said...the name given to the gatherings by Richard Fleeshman, who plays Andy, the dim but strapping flight attendant whom Bobbi wants to devour during a number called Barcelona.Patti explained that ‘the guys come into my dressing room between numbers, and at the end of the first act…there’s plenty of room — and their rooms are way up the stairs.’Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it\u0027s Superdog! Grinning...Inuits fear the curse of HMS Terror has been reawakened by...Share this articleShe and her esteemed dresser Murray Lane started feeding them. Apples with almond butter, and other tidbits. Ashley Campbell arrived one day with smoked salmon and cream cheese. George Blagden brought sausage rolls. Sometimes Patti picks up mini pork pies from a posh butcher in Holborn and serves them with chutney. A fruit course might include clementines and strawberries. ‘They’re only little nibbles,’ she said.‘We gossip, and everybody’s listening for the cue to go back on stage. It’s turned into this very sweet, wonderful bonding of the company. In my dressing room.’The Broadway legend said that ‘the guys have banned the women’ — though Mel Giedroyc shows up anyway.‘I don’t know why the women were banned,’ Patti mused. ‘If there’s anything left over, we give it to the girls.’With Christmas approaching ‘we’re going wild now’, she said, adding mince pies to the snacking menu.I told her that, in my opinion, the best are to be found at Maison Bertaux in Soho (I shall be leaving a few at the stage door for them).It’s clear Patti has been enjoying her time in London. She will remain here until Company closes on March 30. ‘I couldn’t be happier,’ she said, with a cat-that-got-the-clotted-cream kind of smile. ‘Happy on stage, and content in my life. That’s the way I phrase it.‘Usually with musicals I’m like: “When’s it’s going to end?” I’m already mourning the end of this one, because it’s a great experience.’And it’s a great show. I caught up with Company (for about the fourth or fifth time) a couple of days before our tea date, and every performance has deepened: Patti’s and Rosalie’s in particular.The Juilliard School-trained thespian clearly adores her co-star — and the whole of the company of Company — and is torn about repeating the role if the show plays on Broadway. Which I’m certain it will.She said she faced a similar dilemma when she played in the original cast of Les Miserables at the Barbican, where she created the role of Fantine. (She also played Norma Desmond in the original, West End production of Sunset Boulevard.)‘This is my company — I belong to this company,’ she said. ‘I had said that I’d never do another musical on Broadway. But I did this for Marianne, in London. I had no idea it would turn out to be this happy, incredible experience.’But doing it in New York? Starting in a new musical there would be ‘so complicated’. ‘You start your first rehearsal exhausted. You start the run exhausted.’And then there’s the acting...We discuss a revival of a play in New York which we both saw and both struggled to understand.‘I get told off about my diction but at this I was going “What did they say?!” I wanted to shout: “Slow down! Enunciate!!”’And the musical performances haven’t been much better. ‘I go: “Really? Really?! You call that a leading lady? You call that a leading man?” They don’t come across the footlights.’She noted that the great Ethel Merman (whom she never saw, live) could hit the theatre’s back wall without a microphone. A rare occurrence today.‘They’re forgetting how to P R O J E C T,’ she enunciated, with such command that hotel staff 20 yards away leapt to attention.‘Often they’re miscast, just because they had success on TV or something. They’re not successful, because they’re limited — because they don’t come across the footlights.‘I think people forget that they’re doing it for an audience, and that there’s more to it than learning the lines and singing as beautifully as you can.‘You have to want to do it. You have to have the technique to do it. You have to be fearless.’          \u0027It’s clear Patti has been enjoying her time in London. She will remain here until Company closes on March 30. ‘I couldn’t be happier,’ she said, with a cat-that-got-the-clotted-cream kind of smile. ‘Happy on stage, and content in my life. That’s the way I phrase it\u0027She went on to praise Rosalie Craig. ‘She makes me cry because I’ve seen women her age in musicals who have gotten great reviews and even won awards and I’ve gone “Why?”‘But watching Rosalie is different. She’s the essence of what a leading lady in musical theatre should be.’We paused, while she sampled more delights from ‘Aunt Wilhelmina’s’ menu (little sandwiches), and I tackled ‘Uncle Seymour’ (Scotch quail eggs, mini truffled sausage rolls).There were cakes, and two snowman Pavlovas, which we happily donated Jo Davidson, my long-suffering photographer.We could have carried on for hours, but five o’clock was fast approaching and Patti wanted to get to the Gielgud. Her progress to the door was slowed by a group of American actors at the next table, keen to fete her. And who could blame them.Here’s to the sensational lady … who drinks tea.   Ben\u0027s unlikely blonde ambitionSome like it hot, and Ben Whishaw is preparing to walk through the flames to portray Marilyn Monroe in a new play. Yes, that’s what I said.Whishaw will star in a new work by Anne Carson, the renowned classics professor and poet. ‘It’s called Norma Jeane Baker Of Troy,’ the actor told me. ‘Norma Jeane Baker was Monroe’s real name and the play’s about Marilyn Monroe — and I play her . . . sort of.’He added that the American soprano Renee Fleming will sing in the production, which is being directed by Katie Mitchell at The Shed, a new arts complex opening in Manhattan in the spring.  \u0027Some like it hot, and Ben Whishaw (left) is preparing to walk through the flames to portray Marilyn Monroe (right) in a new play. Yes, that’s what I saidWhishaw is on the big screen at the moment in the delightful Mary Poppins Returns — he plays grown up Michael Banks, with Emily Mortimer as his sister Jane. The magical nanny, deliciously played by Emily Blunt, returns to Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane to help the siblings as much as Michael’s three young children.Whishaw sings in the Poppins film but stressed that he won’t in Norma Jeane Baker Of Troy.‘It’s about as far away from Mary Poppins as you could possibly go,’ he told me.Carson’s piece, partly spoken and partly sung, is based on the Greek tragedy of Helen, the beauty whose face launched a thousand ships. Scholars have tried before to link the allure of Monroe with the Ancient Greeks. Moral philosophy lecturer Dr Edward Spence, for instance, noted Monroe’s comment in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes that ‘when love goes wrong, nothing goes right’, claiming that ‘Plato would agree’.After Marilyn, Whishaw will join his 007 colleagues, as Q, in Bond 25, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga.   Now that\u0027s what I call a super-scary power coupleDirector Adam McKay sets the opening scene of his film Vice, about Dick Cheney, George W. Bush’s vice president, in the town of Casper, Wyoming.It’s 1963 and Cheney, then a very unpolished young man, is shown drunk as a skunk.McKay then cuts to a shot of Cheney sitting in the White House Situation Room, where he has taken control of operations after the 911 attacks in 2001. Bush was being flown to a place of safety — which suited Cheney just fine.          Director Adam McKay sets the opening scene of his film Vice, about Dick Cheney, George W. Bush’s vice president, in the town of Casper, Wyoming. Amy Adams stars as Lynne Cheney in Vice          \u0027In the film Cheney is seen in 1963 then a very unpolished young man\u0027.Christian Bale as Dick Cheney in Adam McKayMcKay’s masterstroke was to cast Christian Bale and Amy Adams as Cheney and his wife Lynne. They are sublime.‘I’ve never seen someone so purely interested in power,’ McKay said of Cheney. Equally, it’s rare that I’ve seen performances, such as the ones Bale and Adams deliver, that embody that sense of power on the screen.McKay said he and Bale spent a lot of time talking about characters who internalise their emotions. ‘They cover themselves up and Christian’s very good at giving life to such people,’ McKay said. Cheney may not have been a great orator but ‘he knew that the real power resides in the ones who are out of the spotlight’.McKay added that while preparing the film he thought of the 1986 movie Sid And Nancy, about Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious and his girlfriend Nancy Spungen. Both were junkies.‘That was a love story,’ he commented, and this is a love story, too. ‘Lynne Cheney wanted safety, security — and she wanted control. And if Dick was going to be with her, he’s going to get those things. He has to, if he loves her.‘I kept thinking of Sid and Nancy and how one of them had to become what the other wanted, if they wanted to be together,’ he told me when we met at the Soho Hotel. ‘There are people in Casper who to this day claim that no matter who Lynne married, he would have made it to the White House.’You’re drawn in by the Cheneys in Vice — but they scare you half to death too.I’ve long been fascinated by the intricacies of American politics, so Vice was like caviar to me. It received six Golden Globes nominations, so I will watch with interest at the Globes’ ceremony in Beverly Hills on January 6.

China\u0027s new type of domestically-built destroyer, a 10,000-tonne warship, is seen during its launching ceremony at the Jiangnan Shipyard  in Shanghai on June 28, 2017Up to five Type 052D destroyers have been spotted on the satellite images of the shipyard this year, according to the study.Type 052D, a class of guided-missile destroyer, has been described as the \u0027backbone\u0027 and \u0027workhorse\u0027 of the Chinese navy. A military report from China\u0027s Sina.com last week suggested Beijing aimed to have a total of 24 of those vessels. As of August, 14 of them had been launched and the rest are being built, it is reported.Other vessels observed include icebreaker Xue Long, or Snow Dragon, and its upgraded version Xue Long 2. Xue Long 2, China\u0027s first self-developed icebreaker,  was launched from the Jiangnan Shipyard in September. The ship is China\u0027s second polar research vessel and puts Beijing on par with Washington in terms of operational icebreakers. Seven to 10 Type 726A air-cushioned landing crafts were also found to be moored at the shipyard throughout the year. Media reports from last year claimed that the Chinese military was mass-producing the vessels in the Jiangnan Shipyard.             Icebreaker Xue Long 2 prepares to take water in the Jiangnan Shipyard on September 10CSIS expert Dr. Matthew Funaiole said he and his colleagues decided to analyse the Jiangnan Shipyard to find out its importance to the modernisation of the People\u0027s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).Dr. Funaiole told MailOnline: \u0027There is a lot of interested in the PLAN\u0027s modernisation, especially with regard to the pace at which China is producing modern, capable warships.\u0027  China\u0027s state-run Xinhua News Agency last month reported that Beijing was building its third aircraft carrier, marking the first official Chinese media confirmation of the warship\u0027s construction.Rumour has it that the warship is being built in the Jiangnan Shipyard. Dr. Funaiole said the team also hoped to verify the claims, but they were not able to find any evidence of the construction of an aircraft carrier in the shipyard. China currently has two aircraft carriers: Liaoning, a refitted Soviet ship it bought from Ukraine that went into service in 2012, and Type 001A, the country\u0027s first domestically designed and built carrier.           China\u0027s President Xi Jinping has vowed to build a world-leading naval force for the countryChina\u0027s president Xi Jinping has vowed to build a leading navy since he took the office in 2012. In April, China held its largest-ever naval parade on the South China Sea which involved 48 warships, 76 warplanes and more than 10,000 soldiers, according to Xinhua News Agency.While reviewing the parade, President Xi said the mission for China to build a strong naval force had never been more pressing. Analysis of Jiangnan Shipyard | ChinaPower Project"},{"url":null,"title":"Inside Morocco beheading suspects squalid home Jealous man lived rundown family house","story":"    A suspect is arrested by the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ) in coordination with the Royal Gendarmerie and national security services in Marrakesh           Another suspect is detained as part of the investigation carried out after finding the dead bodies of two foreign tourists in the region of Chamharouche (Al Haouz Province)The developments appear to confirm fears that the attack was planned by a wider Isis network operating in the country, which has not seen a terror attack on westerners since 2011.Meanwhile pictures have revealed the squalid house of one of the terror suspects accused of the Scandinavian women\u0027s murders.Images show the dilapidated house of Younes Ouaziad, one of four men held over the murders of Dane Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, and Norwegian Maren Ueland, 28, in the Atlas Mountains.Family members say the 26-year-old, who lived in grinding poverty at his father\u0027s home in the El Azzouzia district of Marrakesh, had repeatedly refused to get a job - even after his wife had a miscarriage.The obsessive hunter became intensely \u0027jealous\u0027 of his wife after he turned to religion, his wife added, forbidding her from leaving the house alone.

Sarah and Ahmed El Kerrami (both pictured, outside court) had hoped to overturn the decision at the appeal stage - but it was upheld Since then, she and her mum, Fereshent Salamat, had been bombarded with noise from a boiler, fridge, taps and a fireplace above, she said.The El Kerrami family used the flat \u0027like a playground, kids running and dropping things for seven hours non-stop\u0027, she told the judge.Awarding her damages, Judge Parfitt said it was the noise of simple \u0027day-to-day living\u0027 which had caused the problems in the mansion block.Although he said Miss Fouladi and her mum\u0027s evidence was exaggerated, the judge said noise was \u0027...sufficiently loud to be invasive and disturbing...\u0027          The neighbours live in this plush property in Kensington, West London, where they began to feud about noise \u0027We\u0027re orced TO, not FROM each other\u0027: That’s how Fergie...Ex-wife who first met her tycoon husband when she worked in...Share this articleThe El Kerramis and the family company which owns their flat should have had carpets on the wooden floors in living areas, he said.And, when the floor was replaced before they moved in, nothing had been done to limit noise transmission between the flats.Appealing, the El Kerramis argued that, having found Miss Fouladi\u0027s evidence exaggerated, Judge Parfitt was wrong to find in her favour.

The BBC put Evans onto the Radio 2 breakfast show eight years agoIt is also a huge disappointment to the audience when someone leaves a role they do brilliantly well. Evans is one of the all-time greats of radio presentation, and still firing on all cylinders. His worth seems more apparent than ever in the times we\u0027re living through. While the news programmes chunter on about the ups and downs of Westminster politics or the latest warnings from Brussels about Brexit, and the world seems gloomier by the day, Evans\u0027s show is sunny and high-spirited.Some may still resist his charms, but for an overwhelming majority he has created a morning family — reinforced by the way he involves his own children as a modern, slightly imperfect dad.This week, once again, his nine-year-old son Noah has been asking some of the questions and assisting with corny jokes that show every sign of having been supplied by his father. But on these airwaves there are no domestic rows and the energy level is always fizzing.          Chris Evans and his wife, Natasha, leave Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey with their newborn twins, and Eli, six, and Noah, nineThis is no mean achievement for someone starting at 6.30am for a three-hour show, five days a week and Evans attracts an audience of all ages.The students I talk to as Master of Selwyn College, Cambridge, will mention Evans\u0027 name much more frequently than those of the news agenda-setters on Radio 4 or whoever is currently doing the Radio 1 breakfast show.The sobbing you hear is therefore not just from listeners but from BBC bosses who are losing one of their main assets to a direct rival.The Evans ratings have had a slight wobble recently and dipped below 9 million a week, but they still beat all other radio programmes and are two million ahead of Radio 4\u0027s flagship Today. They also dwarf almost all television audiences in this multi-channel world.This success shouldn\u0027t obscure the gamble that the BBC took in putting Evans onto the Radio 2 breakfast show eight years ago.He was taking over from the ultimate broadcasting icon, Sir Terry Wogan and there was the starkest of contrasts between a laid-back wordsmith Irishman and a hyperactive and sometimes rebellious DJ who had made his reputation in shows for young people.The shift was from Wogan\u0027s one-to-one conversational style into Evans\u0027 morning \u0027zoo\u0027 with seemingly a cast of thousands but what they both had was a warmth and an invitation to be part of their club, and that has retained the loyalty of listeners.I had some experience of the Evans\u0027 style when he was part of the line-up for the London 2012 Olympics, which I was running for the BBC.We wanted to build up excitement for the Games across all the BBC\u0027s services, and Evans did that in spades on Radio 2. His show was relocated to the Olympic Park, and I went along for the duty \u0027BBC suit\u0027 interview on the morning of the opening ceremony.I\u0027m taking a guess that there were a few million other people he\u0027d rather have been talking to, but he was glowing in his welcome without being sycophantic and impishly intelligent in his questioning. It was one of those rare occasions when a boss could be part of a feelgood experience.Like Wogan, he makes you feel part of his clubBut the flip side of the Evans Olympic experience happened later in the Games. BBC management had taken a tough line in resisting a bombardment of suggestions from Downing Street that the then prime minister David Cameron would be the perfect guest for our Olympic programming.There must have been something about the record audiences on TV and radio, and the national exuberance, that the Conservatives wanted to convert into political advantage – and we were determined to keep this kind of politics away from the sport.We bopped on the head every offer from No. 10, and we sternly told producers that interview bids for the PM were not allowed.    Evans is seen out and about this week in London. His audience figures dwarf almost all television audiences in this multi-channel world, ex-BBC bigwig Roger Mosey saysIt therefore came as something of a surprise to wake up in my BBC-rented flat in Hackney one morning during the Games to hear David Cameron chirping away happily on the Chris Evans show — and not from Downing Street but from the Olympic Park, where he had been respectfully let in by our security team.There were some perfectly fair questions from his host, but Cameron was living Downing Street\u0027s dream: linking himself with the success of the Games on the nation\u0027s most popular radio show.A good old-fashioned internal BBC row then took place.From Prince Harry to pop queens, he has pulling powerOn our morning editorial conference call with the director-general, the Evans show was in the dock. Decrees of condemnation were issued instant inquests were launched. The circumstances were murky, but it seemed that this was largely Evans\u0027 own initiative.In normal circumstances, we would have been delighted that a presenter had the kind of contacts that could get the prime minister into a peak-time special appearance and, six years on, I would give Evans full credit for that if not for adherence to editorial policy.Evans\u0027 pulling power has continued with Prince Harry as a studio guest announcing the Invictus Games for wounded, injured or sick service personnel and veterans, or helping out with the travel news in contemporary royal fashion, alongside the daily interviews with the more routine kings and queens of pop.BBC bosses are accused of using Katya and Seann Walsh kiss...Convicted sex offender who told vigilantes it \u0027doesn\u0027t...Share this articleInsiders say that it is not always a bed of roses working on the Evans show.His rebelliousness was at its peak in his Radio 1 days when he had a falling out with his boss, whom he nicknamed on air as \u0027the fat controller\u0027.He is reported to have mellowed with age, but \u0027a rollercoaster\u0027 is one description of a typical working day when he moved to Radio 2.Evans drives himself hard and has a head full of creative ideas, and it can be a tough ask for the people charged with turning those into programme items.The bad times could be pretty bad, say some, though characteristically the rewards from Evans were high, too. A team Christmas dinner, at his expense, would shun all the BBC-favoured restaurants around Broadcasting House and be held at a luxurious Heston Blumenthal restaurant instead.Perhaps it\u0027s no surprise that many of Evans\u0027 team are moving with him to Virgin.Mind you, Evans can afford the largesse. His wealth is estimated in the Sunday Times Rich List at more than £50million, and at his peak he was earning more than £2.2m a year from the BBC.

Chuck Schumer released a joint statement with Nancy Pelosi following the shutdown at midnightRoughly 800,000 federal workers will now go paychecks until the government reopens. Some 420,000 employees of the federal government are likely to be deemed essential and kept on the job with the promise of  back pay. Another 380,000 workers will be sent home on unpaid leave. They\u0027re likely to get checks from the government down the line, but that requires an act of Congress. A senior administration official said that in the event of a shutdown: \u0027Agencies and programs with missions essential to the safety of life and the protection of property will continue to operate. \u0027For instance, our southern border will continue to be patrolled by Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

That was not to happen.  Senators had voted to proceed on a motion to consider a House bill that cannot pass so that they would have a legislative vehicle for an eventual agreement, if one is to be arrived at, over the weekend.McConnell said in a dinnertime update that it was clear that it will take the support of Senate Democrats to overcome a 60-vote threshold and a presidential signature to turn whatever legislation is passed into law.

Pictured are pupils with headteacher Dave McPartlin, centreLast month, the school was crowned happiest primary school in Britain as part of the National Happiness Awards, for goodness’ sake.When I meet them, they are also buzzing, fizzing almost, from the excitement of having their first single, Light Up (in aid of the Alzheimer’s Society), in the UK Charts. In recent weeks, dressed as elves, draped in fairy lights and led by their astonishingly energetic head Dave McPartlin, 40, they’ve appeared on The One Show, Sky News, ITN and in newspapers and blogs around the world.They’ve driven hundreds of miles through the night to London to meet Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans as he arrived outside the BBC studio at 5.45am, and were invited on to his show.They’ve sung in schools, care homes and nurseries and assured everyone, everywhere they go, that all they really want for Christmas is ‘to make memories’, to spend time with families and to spread some good in the world.‘Time and memories, that’s what really matters,’ says Grace, ten.So they’d be forgiven for being a teeny bit downcast to have been beaten to the top spot yesterday by a song about sausage rolls, in aid of food banks, with their own single coming up 64th. But not a bit of it.Who wins the Christmas Lunch store wars? How supermarkets...You’re all Christmas stars! Actor Rupert Everett salutes...Share this article‘It doesn’t matter if we don’t make No. 1. Our school’s attitude is not about getting somewhere, it’s about trying to get there,’ explains Ruby, ten, from Year 6.Abbie, also ten, agrees: ‘We tried our hardest and it was fun. We did all we could. You have to take the risk or you lose the chance. So we did.’Such depth of character and stoicism beyond their years.Flakefleet’s big push to top the Christmas pop chart began just four weeks ago.‘Staff thought I’d lost the plot when I said, ‘Let’s go for the Christmas No. 1!’ says head Mr McPartlin. So he put up a new school Facebook page, ‘Flakefleet For Christmas No. 1’, and that was that.He is not the sort to let lack of cash, or any relevant experience, or contacts in the music business, or indeed any knowledge of music at all, to get in the way.‘On reflection, it would have been better if we’d started a couple of weeks earlier,’ he says.The song was written by pupils and teachers along with couple of producers who were friends of friends and helped out for nothing. The recording — featuring all 471 children — took place in a studio lent to the school.          Staff and children from the school have gained media coverage after doorstepping Chris Evans at BBC Radio 2 and were then invited on his show, picturedThe accompanying video — featuring the pupils and residents of Fleetwood Hall Care Home laughing, hugging, whizzing about in wheelchairs and learning to floss-dance on Blackpool promenade — was shot entirely on Mr McPartlin’s iPhone and edited on his home computer one evening.I defy anyone to watch it without laughing, crying and generally feeling happier.There was something so joyful, so uplifting, so happily infectious about Flakefleet’s offering that, despite the odds, it entered the midweek charts at No. 15 last week.‘No. 15! It’s crazy,’ says Mr McPartlin. ‘It’s mad. But it just shows that you can do anything if you try. Anything at all. It didn’t even cost a penny.’Everything necessary to record the song and put this wonderful school on the map has been donated.A local bus company provided transport so the children could zip all over the country to perform.‘Some children had never been to London, so it seemed a shame not to show them around,’ says Mr McPartlin.Fleetwood Town Football Club have been unfailingly supportive. Blackpool Winter Gardens were lent free of charge for Light Up’s official launch. Smart posters, flyers, logo’d T-shirts and sweatshirts have all been given — leaving a whole school room dedicated to publicity.On Thursday lunchtime, I watched a light aircraft trail a jaunty ‘Flakefleet For Christmas No. 1’ banner across the grey skies.‘Fleetwood is a small place, but that’s the only small thing about it,’ the head says.Sadly, no one can donate hours in the day for Mr McPartlin, who has three young children, a long-suffering fiancee Alex (who’s been roped in to help with publicity) and hasn’t done a jot of Christmas shopping.‘The house is a bombsite, we’re eating terrible food and we haven’t watched telly for a month!’ he says. ‘I would dearly love some sleep. I am absolutely exhausted!’But all that, too, bounced off Mr McPartlin as he drove down the M6 to London and back — first with a carload, and later busloads, of kids dressed as singing elves, giving them their first taste of fame. ‘I’m loving every minute,’ he says. ‘Our school motto has even been changed to “Dare to Dream”.‘It used to be “everyone is a learner and every experience is a learning opportunity”. But you have to dream. You have to follow your dreams. The children are already walking taller and prouder. If you look after confidence, resilience and perseverance, the rest will follow.’Mr McPartlin has never been the sort of chap to do things by halves.When Prince Harry and Meghan married in May, the school put on their own mock Royal Wedding.In the summer, Mr McPartlin and his 80-strong staff put on FlakeFest to celebrate the school’s singers, dancers and performers.    The children, pictured recording, say they were not disappointed the single reached no.64 in the charts and added they just wanted to \u0027make memories\u0027‘It shouldn’t just be about classroom learning’ is his philosophy.The ‘happiest school’ accolade was a result of staff routinely going far, far beyond the boundaries of either their job description or the national curriculum.Indeed, sometimes they take pupils’ washing home to do themselves. They provide extra food, where necessary, and supplement missing birthday and Christmas presents — all with the utmost discretion, of course.‘We don’t want to make a song and dance of it,’ he says. ‘It’s just about providing a supportive environment, where our kids can stand a bit taller, a bit prouder. Happy learners have got to be better learners.’The staff posted a video called ‘What teachers do when the kids go home’ — showing them racing about the corridors on their twirly-whirly teacher chairs, playing in the nursery sandpit, climbing trees, having wheelbarrow races and generally goofing about.No wonder the walls are plastered with thank-you notes from grateful parents, eulogising about the brilliant school.The links with Fleetwood Hall Care Home were forged in 2016. There are joint arts and crafts sessions with the school nursery, residents are invited to major school events and, every week, the older children visit. ‘We love it,’ says one of the Year 6 girls. ‘We get to dance and laugh. They are so happy when we arrive. We play games, we chat. We dance.’The impact on the residents is palpable. ‘They’re wonderful children,’ says Dorothy Billington, who is 93 and features on the video. ‘They listen to you. They chat to you. They love you for what you are. Even if you’re old and tired.’ The idea for the song came at the end of the Royal Wedding extravaganza.‘We went back to the staff room and we were giddy with excitement and thought, right, what can we do next?Some might have thought that aiming for a Christmas No. 1 — an achievement most professional pop groups never manage — was a touch ambitious. But, naturally, not Mr McPartlin. ‘I want children to know they can do anything if they throw themselves at and commit to it,’ he says.‘I want them to know they might knock on 1,000 closed doors but that the 1,001st could give them their special break.’He has wanted to be a head teacher since he was a boy. After a childhood in a happy working-class home in Hartlepool, he studied at Durham University. He is exactly the sort of head that every school wants and then worries they’ll manage to keep.Flakefleet is his second headship. He has already helped turn a Church of England primary near Morecambe, Lancashire, from an Ofsted Good to an Outstanding.When he visited Flakefleet, he felt a yearning. ‘I looked around and thought: I want to be your head. Your leader,’ he says simply.After three years, he has already made a huge impact. Not just on the Ofsted results —which are rocketing — but on the children, staff and wider community.          Scenes in the video (seen) show the youngsters dancing with residents at the care home in Lancashire as they enjoy day out          Flakefleet Primary School went viral when pupils staged their own version of Harry and Meghans Royal wedding earlier this year‘I can’t think of a time when I’ve gone home and complained about work the whole time I’ve been here,’ he says. ‘I love our kids. I want them to do well. I really love them.’The kids, meanwhile, are an absolute delight — boisterous and bouncy, as they should be, but also polite and courteous.Two blonde girls approach me unbidden, to say: ‘I hope you’re having a very nice day!’ and, ‘I hope you like our school.’They all adore their head.‘He cries more than us!’ says one of the Year 6 boys.‘And he drinks A LOT of coffee but he’s taught us not to stop and think about things too much before we do them — and just go for it,’ says another. ‘He’s the best head in the world and he’s ours.’Even more surprising, they do, genuinely, appear to believe in his vision.‘Christmas is about family,’ says a boy called Jack.‘For Christmas, I’d like to be able to get along with my brother better,’ says Abbey. ‘We argue all the time.’Sadly, the competition to be Christmas No. 1 was always rather strong.There were rival offerings from global superstars Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Mark Ronson and the inevitable X Factor winner. Also, a host of home-grown charitable songs, including a clutch of handsome firemen, singing for injured firefighters, and a group of organ transplant recipients with a song called Tomorrow.And the favourite: a self-styled ‘dad blogger’ from Nottingham singing a comedy ode to sausage rolls in a parody of Starship’s hit We Built This City, raising money for the Trussell Trust’s network of food banks.So, no, Flakefleet Primary didn’t make it to No. 1. But they have been invited on to next year’s Britain’s Got Talent. And what they did was so much more important. They showed us how to care, to love, to live . . . and to dare to dream."},{"url":null,"title":"More pentagon officials planning resign wake Mattis departure","story":"    Outgoing Secretary of Defense James Mattis (left) make a final attempt Thursday, before resigning, to convince President Donald Trump that it was unwise to pull all of America\u0027s military troops out of SyriaMedia reports Thursday focused on Mattis\u0027 veiled reference to Russia and China in the letter, which explained his belief in \u0027being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors.\u0027Trump defended his record in a tweet: \u0027There has never been a president who has been tougher (but fair) on China or Russia – Never, just look at the facts.

We must rebuild our country first.\u0027Mattis, a famously well-read and edurite \u0027warrior-monk,\u0027 wrote in careful prose about America\u0027s failure to tend to its crucial international alliances and partnerships, concluding that Trump should find a replacement whose views aligned more with his own, The president tweeted his thanks for the retired Marine Corps general\u0027s help with \u0027the purchase of new fighting equipment\u0027 and \u0027getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations.\u0027 The White House hasn\u0027t denied that Mattis quit as a direct consequence of Trump\u0027s announcement, over his objections, that America\u0027s troops stationed in Syria would be pulling out. That decision will leave large swaths of Syria unguarded against efforts by Vladimir Putin\u0027s Russia to prop up strongman Bashar al-Assad in his bloody civil war with rebel groups.            Mattis sees Chinese President Xi Jinping as a powerful adversary and blames Trump for not doing more to keep U.S.-China military ties strong in order to pre-empt future conflicts  Taking all of America\u0027s troops out of Syria will leave dictator Bashar al-Assad (left) in a much stronger position with Vladimir Putin of Russia (right) given a free hand to protect him          Mattis was a Marine\u0027s Marine, carrying his own pack as a brigadier general          President Donald Trump reportedly overruled Mattis\u0027 objection this week in deciding to withdraw American troops from SyriaMattis\u0027 written message to Trump didn\u0027t mention the Syria conflict, but its unmistakable flamethrower rhetoric left little doubt. \u0027One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies.\u0027Mattis also declared that America \u0027must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours.\u0027 At the White House, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told a crush of reporters that Mattis made the decision about the timing of his announcement.\u0027He and the president have a good relationship, but sometimes they disagree,\u0027 she acknowledged, responding to a question about the Syria troop pullout\u0027s role in the defense secretary\u0027s departure.\u0027The president always listens to members of his national security team, but at the end of the day, it\u0027s the president\u0027s decision to make,\u0027 she said. \u0027He was the one to be elected president, to be the commander in chief, and while he takes all of their opinions, and all of their advice into consideration, at the end of the day it\u0027s his decision to make.\u0027          Mattis was regarded as a steadying influence on Trump and his departure will leave much of Congress worried about the lack of a check on the president\u0027s more arbitrary impulses          White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders didn\u0027t deny on Thursday evening that Mattis timed his departure to show displeasure with Trump\u0027s decision to withdraw America\u0027s troops from Syria over his objection    The president stunned Washington with his announcement, making it on Twitter instead of in an official statementTrump made waves Wednesday at the Pentagon by announcing his withdrawal of America\u0027s mid-size military contingent stationed in Syria.The decision, reached Tuesday in a small group meeting at the White House, didn\u0027t include consultation with Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were in the room. Both objected. Trump declared this week that his administration has won the war against the ISIS terror army, even though the Pentagon has said the group still has 30,000 soldiers in Iraq and Syria. Reactions to Mattis\u0027 announcement fell along partisan lines on Thursday. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who will become speaker in January, said during a press conference at the Capitol that she was \u0027shaken by the resignation of General Mattis\u0027 and called it \u0027a very sad day for our country.\u0027Pelosi encouraged reporters to read the resignation letter, and to pray for the United States.  \u0027You have leaders, great leaders who have left the administration in dismay and the rest of them have left in disgrace. And that\u0027s what this administration has been about,\u0027 she claimed.Most Republicans thanked the defense secretary for more than 40 years of public service. Many Democrats lamented that one of the Trump administration\u0027s few \u0027adults in the room\u0027 would be leaving.Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin said on Twitter: \u0027America has lost more than an exceptional Secretary of Defense. We have lost the adult in the room when the President goes off on a tweet-filled, uninformed rant about our national security.\u0027           California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff will chair the House Intelligence Committee next year he blasted Trump for ignoring Mattis\u0027 advice          Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin said the Trump administration has \u0027lost the adult in the room\u0027          Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was among very few Republicans to offer anything but wistful thanks he tweeted that the Mattis resignation letter points to serious flaws in America\u0027s strategic thinking overseasTennessee Rep. Jim Cooper appeared to be tweeting from the same talking points. \u0027I worry the White House meeting rooms will soon be vacant of adults,\u0027 he wrote.California Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez chimed in: \u0027The adults have officially left the building.\u0027Fellow Californian Adam Schiff, who will chair the House Intelligence Committee in 2019 and 2020, took his criticism a step further.\u0027Old Marines never die, but they do resign after the President ignores their advice, betrays our allies, rewards our enemies, and puts the nation\u0027s security at risk. Turn out the lights when Mattis leaves we will not see his like again while Trump remains in office,\u0027 Schiff tweeted. Outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan, a retiring Wisconsin Republican, issued a more traditional statement, saying Mattis has made the nation \u0027a safer America at home, and a more commanding force abroad. His patriotism and grit are matched only by his humility and graciousness.\u0027 On GOP dissenter, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, tweeted that Thursday\u0027s resignation letter \u0027makes it abundantly clear that we are headed towards a series of grave policy errors which will endanger our nation,damage our alliances \u0026amp empower our adversaries.\u0027 Trump\u0027s top general was blindsided by decision to pull out...¿THEY want it.¿ Trump claims troops killed battling ISIS in...Share this article    The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee called Mattis\u0027 planned departure \u0027scary,\u0027 saying the retired general \u0027has been an island of stability\u0027 amid Trump\u0027s chaosTrump has speculated before about how long Mattis might stay in his Cabinet.Asked in October during a \u002760 Minutes\u0027 interview whether his Defense Department chief might be on his way out, he responded: \u0027Well, I don\u0027t know. He hasn\u0027t told me that.\u0027\u0027I have a very good relationship with him. It could be that he is. I think he\u0027s sort of a Democrat, if you want to know the truth,\u0027 he said. \u0027But General Mattis is a good guy. We get along very well. He may leave. I mean, at some point, everybody leaves. Everybody. People leave. That\u0027s Washington.\u0027 Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner tweeted in horror on Thursday: \u0027This is scary.\u0027 \u0027Secretary Mattis has been an island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration. As we\u0027ve seen with the President\u0027s haphazard approach to Syria, our national defense is too important to be subjected to the President\u0027s erratic whims.\u0027Warner is vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.Mattis isn\u0027t the only senior official on the way out. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly will depart in a matter of weeks, and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is also on a glide path to the private sector.The president drew cheers at political rallies during his late 2016 transition period when he announced that Mattis would run the Pentagon.Trump was fond of calling him \u0027Mad Dog,\u0027 a nickname Marine lore described as a loving tribute bestowed by the men he led.In fact, his men in the field had a different moniker for him when he was a Marine colonel. They called him CHAOS, short for \u0027Colonel Has An Outstanding Suggestion\u0027–a hat tip to Mattis\u0027 reputation as a thinking man\u0027s soldier.Behind the scenes of the Mattis bombshell: More resignations expected after ¿protest¿ exit | Fox News"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b51633bac32bc1d9147681301bd3efd52af0b43/0_177_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2f32a971ec80db44bd80c23fe4e10b8","title":"agency photographer of the year 2018 hannah mckay","story":"This year the picture desk has chosen Reuters photojournalist Hannah McKay as agency photographer of the year. We talked to her about the past 12 months – and she picked out some of her favourite imagesHow would you describe the year from the point of a news photographer?This year has been non-stop but that’s exactly what you want as a news photographer. It keeps you on your toes and pushes you to tell the story in the best possible way.I’ve been lucky enough to be involved in some really interesting stories, including Cambridge Analytica, the Salisbury poisoning, a royal baby, two royal weddings, Donald Trump’s working visit to the UK, the World Cup, the Pope’s visit to Ireland, the migrant caravan in Mexico and, of course, Brexit. Each and every one of them was very different, often challenging but equally as rewarding.What was your favourite assignment?My favourite assignment this year was the World Cup, it was so exciting to be covering a story that had such a global interest, particularly coming from England, where World Cup fever was as big as it was in Russia. Knowing the pictures you’re taking are being seen all over the world is all you want from a story, and the World Cup did exactly that.What is the best image you took or one that touched you – is there a story behind this?My favourite image I took this year was one taken while on my second visit to Mexico covering the migrant caravan. It was the first time in my life I’d seen an actual physical border between two countries. Amazed and fascinated by its existence, I was drawn to spending time at the border fence. It was taken on my first day in Tijuana, I’d been sitting on the beach in front of the fence for about an hour just absorbing my surroundings. It was very busy with locals and tourists enjoying the good weather on the beautiful Mexican beach, so I didn’t expect to witness anything related to the story, but then I spotted a male migrant take his shoes off and he began to climb the fence.It was surreal, I’d travelled over 1,000 km with the caravan as they made their way through Mexico to the US border so that moment and this picture sum up the story for me.Are there any communities that you have made relationships with in your work as a photojournalist?Working with the migrant caravan this year was the most amount of time I’ve spent with any one community as a photojournalist, some of them were wonderful people who were very welcoming. As an outsider looking in, it’s important to build a rapport with people, to be invited into their world because it helps you get the most out of the story.Do you approach stories in a particular way? How do you approach switching between completely different stories and places?The thing I’ve learnt the most about this job is to approach every story with an open mind because you really never know what is going to happen next with it. When people are involved, you just have to let them do their thing and the pictures will follow.One of the best things about this job is the variety that comes with it. Every day is totally different and switching between stories so quickly keeps your mind and your pictures fresh.It’s not unusual to be photographing the prime minister walking out of 10 Downing Street one day and then sat getting wet at Stamford Bridge for a Chelsea game the next, but I wouldn’t want it any other way. I think that says a lot about my attention !Aside from the news-driven material – were there any features in particular that you were most proud of?The feature I shot that I’m most proud of this year is one called: Pride and worry, Britain’s free health service turns 70, the beginning of an ongoing project illustrating life within the NHS. I worked in an NHS hospital while I was studying to become a photographer so it’s something I’d wanted to shoot for quite some time.“I’ve had so many things go wrong with my body in the past four and a half years that it’s just incredible that one organisation can cure so many things and treat me so kindly, efficiently and for free. It’s just astonishing,” said Ritson. He remembers what it was like before the state-funded NHS when healthcare was beyond the reach of many people because they could not afford to pay doctors’ fees.This was the third and final time I was photographing Donald Trump during his working visit to the UK. I’d noticed he had a tendency to hold Theresa May by the hand when they used stairs, so I lay on the floor for 15 minutes waiting for the pair to exit via some steps. As they did, Trump took May by the arm and shouted over his shoulder: “Yes” in response to the question: “Mr President, will you tell Putin to stay out of the US elections?”Rong Lu said she has been coming to the swimming shed for 30 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd6a082b79215f8313c3692faf066c183460f63b/66_461_5720_3433/master/5720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=284ce619486d05a52d395870839418a7","title":"buy your own guardian classic photograph cumbrian shepherd 1990","story":"This week in our regular series of exclusive  print sales is a shepherd with his flock in Cumbria, by  photographer Denis Thorpe photographer Denis Thorpe was on a whirlwind tour of Cumbria in November 1990, documenting the activities of rural communities with the then Countryside Commission, when he chanced upon a pair of shepherds bringing their sheep down from the hills – a ritual known as “the gather”, says Thorpe. “I was lucky to be there at the moment they came through the gate – I felt I’d captured the animals’ breath in the cold air.” It was a beautiful composition, he says: the shepherd with his stick, the dry stone wall, the sheep. “It couldn’t be anywhere but the north of England.” Hannah BoothBuy your exclusive print herePrintsPhotographs are 30x40cm and presented on museum-grade, fine-art paper stocks, with archival standards guaranteeing quality for 100+ years.

It is Gaelic for the stunningly beautiful grassland found in the Hebrides and parts of the Highlands: fertile, a mass of wildflowers, fringed by remote sandy beaches. The first time I saw it, as a teenager on Harris, I wondered why my ancestors had chosen instead to live on the other side, on barren and rocky land, a hard place to grow anything. Within a matter of seconds, the answer dawned. They had lived on the machair but were forcibly moved in the 19th century, like many other casualties of the Highland Clearances.The Clearances, the mass depopulation of the Highlands and Islands, still resonate today. They provide the backdrop whenever the Scottish parliament grapples with land reform or there is another community buy-out. This summer, the journalist and historian Max Hastings, writing in the Times, joined the discussion in a piece about his annual trip to the Highlands for shooting and fishing. Patronisingly, he wrote that the curse of Scotland is “its sense of victimhood, lovingly nurtured over the past century” and cited the Clearances as a prime example. He falls into the ranks of those who claim the scale and suffering has been exaggerated.Scotland has until recently been ill served by historians. At school in the 1950s and 60s, we were taught more about the Tudors than our own history. A textbook at the time, a history of Scotland starting in 1702, ran to 335 pages, of which only one covered the Clearances. The writer John Prebble, English-born and brought up in Canada, broke this embarrassing near-silence with The Highland Clearances, published in 1963 and still the most popular Scottish history book ever written. Writing from a Marxist point of view, he portrayed the Clearances as the unnecessarily brutal expulsion of the population by greedy landowners and clan chiefs to make way for a more profitable source of income – sheep. Academics dismissed it as a blend of fact and fiction.Revisionism was inevitable. It came in the shape of, among others, Michael Fry, a mischievous conservative and author of Wild Scots: Four Hundred Years of Highland History, published in 2005. Fry, whose admirers include Hastings, portrayed the Clearances as a myth that falls apart once probed.Thankfully into the debate comes Tom Devine, Scotland’s best modern historian. Although viewed as tainted by some Scots for coming out in support of independence during the 2014 referendum, he makes history accessible, backed up with formidable original research and statistical evidence. In this book, he chronicles land ownership, the clan system and shifting attitudes towards Highlanders, from heroic soldiers to lazy aborigines. He is populist enough to find space for the romantic Jacobite TV fantasy Outlander, but this is a serious book, which includes a large section on dispossession in the Borders – intended to put what happened in the Highlands and Islands into perspective.Clan chiefs in the Highlands were happy enough to have large populations at various points, especially during the Napoleonic wars. Devine demolishes the idea that Highlanders were by nature more martial than people in other parts of the UK. It was simple economics: the clan chiefs behaved as military entrepreneurs, providing recruits at a price. When the war ended and demand for soldiers fell, they looked for alternative sources of income. Sheep farming was one, and that meant clearing the land. Devine is fair minded, acknowledging landlords and chiefs who tried to devise ways to keep people, but they were in a small minority. “Coercion was employed widely and systematically,” he concludes.The harshest of the expulsions came in the 1840s and 50s with the collapse, as in Ireland, of the staple crop, the potato crop. Families were evicted when they were at their most vulnerable. Devine finds space for the voices of those sent into exile, often ignored in the past because their accounts, mainly told through song and poetry, were in Gaelic. Coming from the Lowlands, Canada, the US and Australia, they record homesickness but also a rage and desire for revenge, against both landlords and sheep.My own family were moved from the machair on the island of Berneray in the Sound of Harris in 1850, according to local historian Peter Kerr, author of The Story of Emigration from Berneray, Harris. Forced out with them were other relatives: the family of one of Scotland’s best-loved poets, and my cousin, Norman MacCaig.MacCaig wrote extensively about his love of the Highlands and believed the land should be masterless. That does not equate to victimhood. I do not feel any sense of victimhood either, having seen the consequences when people around the world cling to historical injustices. I just want to know about Scotland’s past, and am grateful to Devine for producing a balanced, detailed and extremely readable account of one of the saddest episodes in that history. He also makes it harder for conservatives who persist in the claim it was all a myth.• The Scottish Clearances: a History of the Dispossessed 1600 to 1900, by TM Devine, is published by Allen Lane.

We wanted our voices to be heard on Brexit. We’ve now built a national movement across campuses, schools, towns and cities.We’ve gone from being laughed at to offering the most credible way forward. And in doing that, we’ve been able to engage directly with some brilliant, principled politicians across all parties. In contrast to how they are usually seen, I have come to believe that most – even some of those with whom I disagree – are in this for the right reasons.But the past few weeks have filled me with a sense of dread about this new and peculiar world we find ourselves in. It is now less than 100 days until Brexit and, as each day passes – with no vote on any deal or parliamentary progress to avert impending crisis – this anxiety increases. The respect I have gained for the political class is in danger of turning to disgust.Our elders are supposed to know better, to be wiser, yet I see no leadership and no plan: nothing for my generation but prolonged posturing. Rather than engage meaningfully, the prime minister and the leader of the opposition appear to have focused their entire energy on political brinkmanship and time-wasting.Theresa May continues to threaten the country with the prospect of a suicidal no-deal Brexit if she cannot force through a plan that even her own cabinet knows is all but dead. Her ministers tweet their support for her in public but manoeuvre behind her back. For every Jo Johnson or Sam Gyimah who resign on principle, dozens more cling to their ministerial limousines.Where we might have hoped for voices of reason, we see remainers such as Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt ingratiating themselves with the ever-shrinking, ever-aging Conservative base by acting like hardcore Brexiters. Both of them now say they are sanguine about a no-deal eventuality, something they vehemently opposed just months ago.Why could this be? Is the Conservative party really only able to elect a future leader who will welcome a catastrophic no-deal with open arms? They can wave goodbye to the support of my generation if they do. Most Tory MPs spent the last week far more animated by internal spats and Brexit fantasies than the grave political crisis we are in. Shamefully, May pulled the vote on the withdrawal agreement, leading to unabated coverage for her party’s European Reform Group ideologues – who declare no confidence in their leader while claiming Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg would be capable of delivering a better Brexit. It is a farce.And at the same time Jeremy Corbyn, who symbolised a bold and different approach to politics to so many young people like me, now seems to be in thrall to the same techniques of triangulation and gamesmanship he once despised in others.Labour says its priority is a general election and will only campaign for a people’s vote if it fails to secure that. But it admits the numbers are not there to succeed with a motion of no confidence and does nothing.There is no Brexit deal from either the right or the left that can deliver the cake-and-eat-it fantasies we were fed in 2016. And there is no deal that is better than the one we already have.Thousands upon thousands of young people are throwing everything they possibly can into their vision for a positive future inside the European Union. We are engaged with politics. But it’s difficult to engage with politicians who care more for their careers than our futures and those of generations to come.• Lara Spirit is co-president of Our Future Our Choice"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c74735ccf6155048d7e1c157e659edb8fab6fd0/0_170_3753_2252/master/3753.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32ec6279976e322bf655c2c10868cb51","title":"christmas long drive stubbornness","story":"The long drive, the cold pork, the room full of older strangers … this is where my stubbornness had led usIt was all my fault. It usually is. When you’re married with young children but still haven’t managed the transition to hosting Christmas yourself, the question of whose parents you join for Christmas can be a tense one. And here’s the thing. I was determined that fairness meant we would alternate: Christmas day with my wife’s parents one year, and with my own the next.So there was this one year when Alice’s parents were coming down from Northumberland, where they live, to London, where we live, to spend Christmas with her two sisters and their partners and kids – right round the corner from us. But, dammit, it was MY year.It occasioned what I’m pretty sure is the longest marital argument we’ve had. It started in mid-August, and reached a rolling boil on Christmas morning. But there were various peaks and troughs. It became clear, for instance, in the run-up to the big day, that we were out of sync with most of my own siblings – so rather than have a full complement of Leiths around the brussels sprouts, we’d be a thinner crowd. And my mum and dad said they didn’t mind much if we all got together on another day. But I was adamant. It had to be Christmas. Christmas day was different. It was a point of principle.Still, because Alice’s parents live much farther away and were only going to be in town for a few days, and were in any case staying with us, I grudgingly conceded that it wouldn’t be the end of the world if we just went home for Christmas day itself. Christmas lunch itself. But that was my Theresa May-style red line. We would, one way or another, spend Christmas lunch with my family. It was only fair.And by this stage, friends, I was sticking to my guns. In fact, I was gorilla-glued to my guns. Even when it became clear that, rather than host Christmas lunch at the family home, my folks had decided that, what with only two of their children’s families coming, they’d drive over and join my auntie’s Christmas party at her house in Gloucestershire. Well, I adore my auntie, as all right-thinking nephews do, and it might besides be a rare chance to see my cousins, so dammit that’s where we’d go. Oh. One or both of the cousins had made other arrangements? NEVER MIND.So, on Christmas morning, in a mood that has (ever since my late grandmother single-handedly lifted a car out of a ditch in a seasonal rage) been known in my family as “Christmassy”, we bid goodbye to my parents-in-law, and my sisters-in-law, and my children’s closest cousins. We left them in a cosy room, aglow with the soft light of the Christmas tree, and scattered with presents, and warm with good cheer, and 10 minutes from our house. We loaded the children into our car and set off on the two-and-a-half-hour drive to my aunt’s house.I can’t remember, mercifully, the conversation we had on the way. But it was not such as is commonly carolled in the sentimental stories of Yuletide. I think words such as “orce” and “drive me home this instant” and “worst Christmas ever” and “stop the car” were merrily exchanged as we barrelled along first the motorway, and then the icy and deserted country lanes.But nobody actually jumped out of the car, and what with all the adult shouting the children were traumatised enough to behave themselves, and we finally rocked up at my aunt’s. Which – she being a great hostess – was not an intimate family lunch but a stand-up-and-stroll-about party for about 50 people, all of them very nice but most of them a generation older and unknown to us. And she’d decided that instead of doing turkey we’d all have slow-cooked shredded shoulder of pork and apple sauce in pancakes an Anglo-Saxon riff on the Chinese duck classic, I suppose.Which would have been fine – except that they’d had a bit of a disaster (someone had innocently turned the oven off that morning) so the meltingly slow-cooked pork was now sliced pork emergency flash-fried by hand.

They shared a director, a predilection for A-list movie stars, a central mystery wrapped up in tight, secretive knots and an underbelly of violence that bubbled up through the thinnest of facades. But Sharp Objects wasn’t so much BLL’s aspirational high-gloss sibling as its oddball goth cousin, thrillingly unable to stick to the parameters that straightforward dramas usually do. It lurched in unusual directions, played with time and memory, and it left viewers – at least the ones who stuck it out to the crucial end of the final credits – in no doubt as to the depths that teenage girls can plumb.The show adapts Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn’s debut novel with experimental grit, a grim sense of humour and an unflinching appetite for the dark side. Camille Preaker – Amy Adams putting on what is surely a career-best performance, in a career full of them – heads home to face her troubled past in Wind Gap, Missouri, a claustrophobic and clammy small town upholding propriety and standards, even as it falls apart to reveal a barely concealed malevolence. Camille returns to investigate the gruesome murders of two young girls, found without their teeth, but she’s ill-equipped to face other people’s demons when she’s practically drowning in her own. She has a drink problem and a body covered in self-inflicted scars, visibly spelling out her pain in a litany of coarsely scored words. Her self-loathing radiates outwards, catching anyone in the vicinity up in its chaos.It can all be traced back to Mommie dearest, Adora, the town’s wealthy de facto ruler, and a woman who makes Livia Soprano look like Supernanny. Patricia Clarkson appears to be having the time of her life skulking around the shadows of this grubby, Tennessee Williams southern gothic-style world, as she wafts around her pristine mansion in a pink slip, amaretto sour aloft. Among many highlights, perhaps the best scene in the series is one of its least flashy, when, over drinks on the veranda, Adora calmly and cruelly informs Camille of the limits of her motherly love.It would have been easy for Sharp Objects to be lurid. The plot is unapologetically pulpy and trashy, and, in the end, the story turns out to be about as subtle as an episode of Scooby-Doo. And yet there is something utterly gripping about the unravelling of Camille’s trauma, and the slow reveal of Adora’s torture, both taken and given – to say nothing of the ultimate twist that shows where the evil truly resides. Whether you see it coming or not, the show delivers a breathtakingly audacious ending, almost funny in its sheer brutality. This has been a boon time for shows that, as the much-mocked Netflix category puts it, are lauded for “featuring a strong female lead”. But in making women the villains as well as the heroes, and in doing so with uniquely nasty verve and vision, Sharp Objects stands in a category all of its own.Donald Glover’s Fox show Atlanta is known to test the boundaries of the sitcom form, but episode six of season two marks the first time it goes full horror. In the 41-minute episode, Darius (Lakeith Stanfield) is lured to an eerie plantation-style mansion in rural Georgia by a messageboard post advertising a valuable piano for pick-up. Once there, Darius is greeted by Teddy – a middle-aged man with a creepy high-pitched voice and some serious daddy issues (actually Glover, unrecognisable in whiteface makeup). The set-up nods to Get Out, Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man and the life of Michael Jackson, but you don’t need to pick up on any of that subtext to find the character of Teddy deeply unnerving. That is, if Teddy even is a character, and not just a figment of Darius’s imagination? Or an alter ego of the mute, bandaged guy in the basement? Or an embodiment of Black America’s continued cultural subjugation? The internet theories abound.BodyguardJed Mercurio may have mastered the action sequence, less so the red-hot hump.

Chances are you were too frickin’ terrified to really figure it out at the time. Hereditary’s bizarre sensory-overload climax left many viewers in a state of raw, bewildered panic, deprived of rational thought processes – the perfect result for any horror movie.Torture porn and jump-scares are so commonplace in horror, it is easy to forget what a genuinely scary movie looks like. Yes, Hereditary has its share of horribly gory moments: the multiple beheadings Alex Wolff smashing his own face on a desk ant-infested corpses Gabriel Byrne burning – all the stuff of nightmares. But the movie operates on so many more levels. It gives you a deeper, longer-lasting type of dread, and that’s often the difference between a great horror movie and a great movie that happens to be a horror.Tracing Hereditary’s own movie ancestry, director Ari Aster cited Rosemary’s Baby, The Innocents and Don’t Look Now – but also, tellingly, dramas such as The Ice Storm and Ordinary People. Because Hereditary is a family movie at heart, even if it does for the institution of family what Jaws did for shark-cuddling.The story begins with the death of Ellen, matriarch of the Graham family, and, in retrospect, it is their happiest moment. A funereal gloom seems to hang over the household at all times, accentuated by the forest outside. Or rather, each family member is under their own inidual cloud of gloom, with their own coping mechanisms: daughter Charlie (Millie Shapiro) makes weird art and strange clicking noises son Peter (Wolff) smokes weed their father (Byrne) always seems to be preoccupied by work while his artist wife Annie (Toni Collette) finds solace in her control-freaky little models. Until she discovers communing with the dead.Bereavement, grief and trauma seem to be this family’s fate: Annie tells her support group that her brother committed suicide and her father starved himself to death. Is there a rational explanation for this family curse? Genetics? Mental illness? Inherited control-freakery? Or is it something more supernatural? The scales steadily tip towards the latter but never quite desert the former. As it ratchets towards its freakout ending, Hereditary packs in the cryptic clues and details: that recurring, curlicued symbol, the treehouse, Annie’s models, the tongue-clicks, the weird flashes of light. Anything could be a threat: a nut cake, a doormat, a decomposing corpse in the attic.It would take as long to “explain” the movie as it does to watch it, although that doesn’t really matter. What is so impressive is how beautifully it all fits together. Hereditary is a fantastically well-made film – technically, it is expertly done – but most of all, it is the characters who stick in the mind, especially Collette, who puts in a brilliant performance. By turns jittery, fractious, anguished, vulnerable and terrified, her anxieties are myriad. She is a reluctant mother who hated her own mother and doesn’t like her own children much, either. She knows what is going on even less than we do. She’s a textbook study in falling apart, and she holds the film together.Bradley Cooper’s character Jackson Maine wetting himself is the most eventful thing to happen at a music award show since Britney’s Gimme More performance.Gaga’s character Ally’s songs might be crap – “Why do you look so good in those jeans? … Why you keep on texting me like that? (Damn)” – but they’re still better than most of Artpop.There’s a bit where Ally wins the Grammy for best new artist, and you think: “As if.” Then you remember Meghan Trainor won that exact same award in 2016.Erm, the dog’s the best thing about it.1 The decades-old Korean peace process went from illegal rocket launches to planning to dismantle North Korea’s entire nuclear weapons programme.2 Angela Merkel completed her vast 171-day coalition negotiation process.3 The world decided once and for all whether it is “Laurel” or “Yanny”.4 Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko literally came back from the dead.5 Ireland overturned its strict abortion laws, ending the 1,000-year-long grip of the Catholic church.When Cardi B released Invasion of Privacy in April this year, expectation was high. Bodak Yellow had been a huge surprise hit, knocking Taylor Swift’s Look What You Made Me Do off the No 1 spot in the US and taking the rapper from niche reality and social media personality to a respected artist – with a lot of pressure riding on the album.However, Invasion of Privacy delivered. Her debut is, in turns, boastful, funny, vulnerable and honest. On Thru Your Phone she’s threatening to serve a cheating boyfriend a bowl of bleach while her broken heart bleeds out. On Be Careful she’s begging him to be gentle with her feelings but also overly concerned he’ll get robbed by a one-night stand. She can do dumb bragging songs – Drip, for instance – but she’s funny, too. She reworks Project Pat’s misogynistic 2001 track Chickenhead into empowering anthem Bickenhead, suggesting women “Pop that pussy while you work  Pop that pussy up in church  Pop that pussy on the pole  Pop that pussy on the stove”. And isn’t that a motto to live by?Cardi came along at exactly the right moment. This was the year stars got “real” about everything – artists speaking about mental health Will Smith joining Instagram just to prove he knew the words to La Bamba – but there’s no one realer than Cardi. Her social media is another level of honest: we’ve seen her on the loo, in bed with (now ex) Offset and taping her boobs into a designer dress. As she says on Best Life: “I never had a problem showin’ y’all the real me  Hair when it’s fucked up  Crib when it’s filthy”. She goes on to admit to having her teeth “fixed” because “those comments used to kill me”. It’s very 2018 #relatable. Cardi B is YOU! She also thinks “those Balenciagas look like socks”! She also likes texts from her ex when they want a second chance! She’s also going through her partner’s phone and hoping the screen goes dark again before they walk back into the room!Invasion of Privacy is so good, in fact, it sparked a feud with self-proclaimed queen of rap, Nicki Minaj. While many suspect the beef began with Nicki feeling threatened by Cardi coming for her crown, it allegedly all started over a dispute about Nicki’s verse on Migos’s Motorsport, and ended with Cardi reportedly chucking her shoe at her rival’s head, a scuffle more suitable for closing time at All Bar One than New York fashion week. See? Relatable. The album – in a year of bloated and overlong hip-hop albums (hi, Drake, Lil Wayne, Migos and Nicki Minaj) – is a short, sweet (48 minutes, 13-track) victory lap aimed at anyone who put down Bodak Yellow as a one-off success.As Cardi herself says: her little 15 minutes lasted long as hell, huh?It has been a year full of mysteries: who bit Beyoncé? Who set off the bomb that killed Julia Montague on Bodyguard? But the biggest one of all is: who is the Kiki in Drake’s In My Feelings?1) Kim Kardashian The evidence: Kiki is Kim’s nickname. Her best mate La La Anthony played Kiki in Drake’s video. Also: Twitter thinks it’s her. But maybe not: Kim’s husband Kanye West went on a whole Instagram video rant slagging off Drake for even SAYING the word Kiki and says it wasn’t her.2) Kiki Dee Don’t go breaking your heart? Drake couldn’t if he tried. It might seem far-fetched for him to have fallen for a 71-year-old singer-songwriter from Yorkshire, but listen: it’s right there in the lyrics!3) Keshia Chanté The evidence: The 106 \u0026amp Park presenter and singer was Drake’s first girlfriend from back in Toronto. They’re still mates – joining him on last year’s Boy Meets World tour – and she just loves the Instagram caption “in my feelings”. He also rapped about her on 2009 mixtape Born Successful.

Rihanna: where’s the album?There are a lot of ways to get over a failed relationship. Do you approach it like Ariana, and make a sassy pop anthem name-checking your exes, with the year’s most catchy chorus? Or do you get a huge tattoo of a phoenix rising from the flames on your back and lie about it for two years before finally being forced to admit it’s real? It’s up to you! It’s your choice! Possibly Ariana did it better, but as I say: it’s your call!This Is America starts off as one song, then changes into another, before changing back again – and that’s a story that I can relate to! Because, yes, Ben initially lied and said I was fake for a movie! Was I hurt? Yes. Was I surprised? Also yes! But then he admitted I was real. He said it was “just banter”. He said that I was our little secret. So thank you Donald Glover for making an important record with a relatable message: changing your mind is OK!This is an absolute banger, perfect for a orced dad having a bit of an MLC (that’s a midlife crisis to those not in the entertainment industry) to dance to, and pull a cocktail waitress half his age. And do you know what I would like, Ben? A bit of appreciation! A bit of thanks! “Thank you for making me look edgy, back tattoo,” or: “Thank you for providing a huge amount of work for cover-up makeup artists on movie sets, back tattoo.” Just saying!Life, Matt Damon often likes to tell me, is all about perception. Is Baby Shark the most annoying song of the year, or is it perfect for parents to stick on a loop at kids’ birthday parties? Am I a huge mistake that Ben is literally trying to put behind him, or am I the perfect manifestation of Ben’s rubbish 2018? Perception!This has a 90s funk vibe to it, so Ben would love it. The 90s were a great time for him, he says. Good Will Hunting, Shakespeare in Love, Armageddon … Personally I think his best work happened in the 00s (who can forget that Jenny from the Block video? Or Gigli?) but he doesn’t like to talk about that because he’s so modest. I can’t get one story out of him about Pearl Harbor! In the song, there’s a bit where it sounds as if Chris is chanting “pussypussypussy”. That won’t be a problem for Ben now that I’m sprawling all over his back and shoulders! C’ya!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/928b03a54a183caa717e0a47ee713158210da102/0_77_2648_1588/master/2648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a829d59ee4271bc741e7f3fb6be10bd5","title":"on the real watership down rabbits are hard to come by","story":"Numbers may be at an all time low as a new adaptation of the novel hits our TV screensThe real Watership Down is not hard to find.In the introduction to his book, Richard Adams helpfully gives the Ordnance Survey map reference – sheet 174. Once located on paper, long-remembered names jump from the map: Nuthanger Farm, Ashley Warren and Honeycomb are all there. It was the multitude of rabbits found on this little square of England that inspired Adams to write Watership Down.The book, and the 1978 film that followed, famously terrified a generation. Instead of fluffy bunnies living in a rural idyll, Adams’s rabbits were both calculated killers and senselessly slaughtered. It was red in tooth and claw, and in the case of the film, shown in glorious and brutal Technicolor.But with a new BBCNetflix adaptation apparently taking a gentler tone, what is the reality for the UK’s rabbit population?For Dr Diana Bell, a rabbit disease expert at the University of East Anglia, it’s pretty dire. “Rabbits may be at an all time low” she says. “When did you last see a roadkill rabbit? You don’t anymore – they simply aren’t around like they used to be”On Watership Down itself, rabbits are certainly hard to come by. The Warren, a deep combe set into the Down, is pockmarked with burrows, but an hour’s watching reveals just four rabbits.Although there are fewer rabbits, the landscape does bear marks of the book. The huge beech tree that sheltered the Watership Down warren was a landmark for many years. “People used to really care about that tree,” says local resident Bryan. “One lady even made her husband drive three hours from Cheshire in the great storm of 1987 just to check it was all right”.The tree finally blew down in 2004, and a newly planted sapling stands in its place – ironically, fenced to protect it from rabbit damage. The names of two of Adams’s rabbit creations, Fiver and Hazel, are scratched into the fencing, the most bucolic of graffiti.Locals out on the hill have started to notice the lack of rabbits too.“Numbers have definitely gone down over the 18 years I’ve been here,” Bryan says, “I think some of that is environmental, but we still see a fair few rabbits with myxie which seems to come and go”Myxomatosis, or myxie, is a disease every bit as horrific as anything in Adams’s book, and it almost wiped out the UK’s rabbit population in the 1950s. The population bounced back, but new strains still affect the rabbits from time to time.For Bell, a newer, silent killer is even more worrying. “Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) first arrived here from China in the early 90s” she says, “and our rabbits were just starting to recover when a new strain appeared in 2010, RHDV2, which has been causing havoc ever since.”The big problem is that while myxomatosis has very obvious symptoms, RHDV2 leaves very little trace.“Rabbits that die from RHDV2 tend to look absolutely fine, so no one reports them” explains Bell, “and one key final stage of the disease is lethargy – so many simply crawl into their burrows and die underground”.As rabbits are subterranean and mostly nocturnal, it is difficult to get a good estimate of their numbers. However, when myxomatosis ravaged the population in the 1950s, buzzards, foxes and stoats all declined along with their main food source, so it is clear a decline in rabbit numbers has effects right up the food chain.But the same is also true down the food chain, and the distinctive chalk grassland of Watership Down relies on the rabbits to keep it maintained.Without the rabbits keeping the grasses down, the landscape so memorably brought to life by Adams might cease to exist too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1093e0eee48847ac4834547a7038dde915a79d6e/16_0_3467_2081/master/3467.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=969f627f60f202ae075314c039543836 660w","title":"fashion designer raf simons leaves calvin klein","story":"Company and Belgian designer announce they are ‘amicably parting ways’ The designer Raf Simons is parting ways with Calvin Klein after two years with the fashion company.The company and the Belgian designer announced they were “amicably parting ways” after Calvin Klein “decided on a new brand direction different from Simons’ creative vision”.A representative for Simons said in an email on Friday night that the designer would have no further comment. Simons revitalised Calvin Klein after being appointed chief creative officer in 2016. His New York fashion week shows were the talk of the industry, beginning with his February 2017 debut, which had a clear political message, opening and closing with the David Bowie song This is Not America.Celebrities flocked to his shows, critics raved, and the fashion establishment rewarded him with three top awards in two years. He won the Council of Fashion Designers of America award for womenswear in both 2017 and 2018, and in a rare feat also took the menswear award in 2017. Simons, 50, who previously worked at Dior and Jil Sander, brought an artsy European approach to the American brand, often citing numerous cultural references but especially Hollywood as inspiration. In September, his runway show riffed on the movie Jaws, with models in various types of wetsuits strolling in front of enormous screens depicting a glistening ocean. Many of the garments had big bites taken out of them as in shark bites. Simons said the shark represented danger. “Very often we are attracted to things that we actually know are dangerous,” he said in an interview. “But we can’t stay away from it.” Calvin Klein will not show during New York Fashion Week in February 2019. No word was given about a successor.

Because the fact is, all of those annually, if bafflingly, popular suggestions are wrong. A true Christmas movie must adhere to the following scientific, mathematical and logical rules:1 It can’t just be set at Christmas, it has to be about Christmas.2 It would feel extremely wrong to watch it at any other time of year.3 It must leave you feeling – in some seemingly subjective but actually very objective way – Christmassy.This is why Die Hard is not a true Christmas movie. Yes, everyone and their gran loves Die Hard, but it is no more a Christmas movie than Lethal Weapon, or Eyes Wide Shut, or Diner – all of which, like Die Hard, are set at Christmas, and none of which, like Die Hard, are about Christmas. I have no problem with watching Die Hard (or Lethal Weapon, or Diner) at Christmas – if anything, their lack of festivity can be a palate cleanser, a satsuma among all the stilton. But consider what Die Hard’s happy ending actually is: it’s not Hans Gruber falling out of a window and it’s not the good people of the Nakatomi corporation getting out of the building alive. It’s the nice cop Al getting over his fear of guns after “accidentally killing a 13-year-old” (so inconvenient) and, in the final scene, shooting a man dead. So someone from the LAPD has learned to kill again. Does that make you feel Christmassy, people? No, it does not.But the real reason Die Hard is not a Christmas movie is that it can be watched at any time of year. For the same reason, Trading Places is not, ultimately, a Christmas movie, as much as we all enjoy the sight of Dan Aykroyd eating fish out of his Santa beard. But it’s not on any level about Christmas, which is why I can and do watch it all year. And before all the diehard Die Hard fans start throwing Quality Street at me in protest, you should know that both of these movies were originally released in the US in the middle of the summer – so not even the film-makers thought they were Christmas movies. So there.Edward Scissorhands, by contrast, is a Christmas movie, thanks to the Christmas-setting climax, the Winona-dancing-in-the-snow scene and Danny Elfman’s pleasingly spooky-but-festive soundtrack. For me, it’s in the same category as Meet Me In St Louis and It’s A Wonderful Life: none of these movies are explicitly Christmassy in the way White Christmas, Elf, A Christmas Story or Miracle On 34th Street are, but they all have a definite Christmas feel to them, one that is based more on the holiday’s wintry darkness than its neon lights. Bad Santa, and to a certain degree Gremlins, also belong in this group, although in both of them the darkness is less delicate and more, shall we say, scatalogical.Which brings me to Home Alone. Now, Home Alone is certainly a Christmas movie. Indeed, that a film about an eight-year-old who is neglected by his parents and then pursued in his own home by two psychopaths is considered a feelgood comedy, as opposed to a horror movie, really is a testament to the power of the Christmas setting. But whereas John Hughes’ other explicitly festive movie, Planes, Trains And Automobiles, says something joyful, sad and true about the holidays (Thanksgiving, in that case), Home Alone just feels hollow. It was a movie written on autopilot, without any of the soulfulness of Hughes’ previous films, such as Ferris Bueller’s Day Off. After Hughes died in 2009, his former muse, Molly Ringwald, wrote this about his later films, including Home Alone: “They were funny, yes, wildly successful, to be sure, but I recognised very little of the John I knew in them, of his youthful, urgent, unmistakable vulnerability. It was like his heart closed.” A real Christmas movie must have its heart very open.This is why the greatest Christmas movie is The Muppet Christmas Carol. It was the first Muppet movie released after the death of the Muppets creator, Jim Henson, and it was made with palpable love and care by his son, Brian. Almost all the old Muppeteers helped him, save for one: Richard Hunt, who voiced Statler, Beaker and others, died from HIVAids the year before the film came out. It is dedicated to both Hunt and Henson, and is infused with a sense of wistfulness, but also hope for the future – in that it disproved some people’s fears over whether the Muppets could continue after Henson’s death. I’ve watched this film every Christmas for two and a half decades – on my own in India, with friends in Thailand, with my parents in London, and now with my own children – and every time it makes me happy and teary and full of joy, just as Christmas should.But if anyone puts on Love Actually, I will genuinely smack them in the face."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0e871d04fac5833ebe6a4e233ae1fa358916c8f/0_68_4138_2482/master/4138.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54466ff5f6150b5bb3e457448a220be3","title":"wolves liverpool premier league match report","story":"The presents have come early this year for Liverpool, who can look forward to spending Christmas Day enjoying the view from the top of the Premier League table. The good news is that the team in that position in eight of the previous nine seasons has gone on to win the league. The bad news is that Liverpool, back in 2013-14, were the one club to come up short.Not that this Liverpool team is likely to be burdened by the past. Jürgen Klopp has assembled a formidable side and victories such as this one will do nothing to dampen the belief that Liverpool are authentic title challengers and capable of stretching Manchester City in a way that would have been unthinkable for anyone last season.Liverpool have now recorded seven successive top-flight games, their unbeaten Premier League run stretches to 19 matches, and when Klopp spoke afterwards about possibly needing as many as 105 points to win the title, it did not seem outlandish to imagine his team finishing the season with that sort of haul.Mohamed Salah is the Premier League’s top scorer once again, after taking his tally for the season to 11 with an exquisite goal, and the Egyptian also set up Liverpool’s second. Virgil van Dijk, with his first goal for the club since he scored on his debut against Everton in the FA Cup, converted Salah’s cross and it was particularly impressive to see the way in which Liverpool closed the game down thereafter.Klopp used the word “mature” to describe Liverpool’s performance and that captured it perfectly. They had a slightly difficult period towards the end of the first half, when Wolves started to take control of the game for the first time, but otherwise this was a highly professional Liverpool display, with Van Dijk’s commanding presence at the heart of the defence every bit as impressive as Salah’s beautiful touches at the other end of the pitch.Wolves have proved to be awkward opponents this season, beating Chelsea and taking points off both Manchester clubs as well as Arsenal, yet their hopes of recording a first victory over Liverpool at Molineux since 1981, when Mark Lawrenson and Bruce Grobbelaar were making their debuts, looked slim from the moment that Salah opened the scoring.The goal was simple enough in its construction – Fabinho played a one-two with Sadio Mané on the right flank – but it was exquisitely finished by Salah. He was standing almost sideways on when he nonchalantly flicked Fabinho’s cross beyond Rui Patricio with the outside of his left boot from about eight yards.From Wolves’ point of view it was a disappointing goal to concede. Up until that point they had soaked up plenty of Liverpool possession without being cut open.Ruben Neves, however, switched off and failed to track Fabinho on the edge of his own penalty area, enabling the midfielder to run in behind unopposed. Fabinho’s centre was perfect and what followed was a moment of class from Salah.The goal felt a little harsh on Wolves, who had carried the greater attacking threat in the early stages, even if Liverpool were seeing much more of the ball. Adama Traoré saw one shot saved and dragged another wide, and Alisson denied Romain Saiss following a lovely Wolves move that saw Conor Coady release Matt Doherty with a raking diagonal pass.Salah’s goal four minutes later could easily have discouraged Wolves but, to their credit, the home team continued to attack with conviction. Allison kept out Jonny Castro’s effort, following a neat exchange between Saiss and Traoré, and Doherty had claims for a penalty turned down when his sinuous run into the Liverpool area was brought to a halt by James Milner.As much as Wolves were playing well, chasing a game against this Liverpool team is far from ideal and it was no real surprise when the visitors extended their lead midway through the second half. By that point Liverpool were looking more and more comfortable. Jordan Henderson, who was making his 300th Liverpool appearance, and Fabinho were dictating the game from their deep-lying midfield positions – this was the first time the two have started together – and Wolves’ attacking threat had diminished.Van Dijk had the measure of Traore – the Dutchman even managed to match the forward for pace in a fascinating duel close to the touchline just after the hour mark – and Nuno Espírito Santo, the Wolves manager, found himself in that difficult position whereby he needed to make changes to try to force an equaliser but knew that by doing so there was a danger Liverpool would add a second.That is exactly what happened. Adam Lallana, on for the injured Naby Keita, saw his close-range effort blocked after Salah and Mané combined, and Liverpool profited from the corner that followed. Saiss’s clearance dropped for Salah, who was loitering on the edge of the area, and his perfectly flighted cross picked out Van Dijk, who coolly volleyed home from just inside the six-yard box. Georginio Wijnaldum could and should have added a third in stoppage time after another Salah raid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1629ce5c657dc351bdf47797200e9c10f3e77c3/81_306_928_557/master/928.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=4a2c5f48adcbd546af6a7e38fceb7523","title":"hiddink di matteo joe kinnear interim managers","story":"Caretaker manager became too old-fashioned a concept for the Premier League so in came a new kind of stopgap: the interimWhatever happened to the caretakers? While Manchester United appeared to break new ground by securing Ole Gunnar Solskjær on loan from Molde until the end of the season, the Norwegian’s announcement as the club’s interim manager was more in keeping with the modern trend.While Blackburn’s perennial safe pair of hands Tony Parkes and Stuart Gray, who took the temporary reins at six clubs (Aston Villa, Wolves, Burnley, Portsmouth, Sheffield Wednesday and Fulham), had to make do with the caretaker role in the 90s and 00s, it has become increasingly common for clubs to opt for a longer short-term appointment to varying degrees of success.The original interim certainly made his presence felt at St James’ Park. Asked to replace Kevin Keegan by owner Mike Ashley, Newcastle drew their first two matches before Kinnear’s foul-mouthed tirade at journalists led to him refusing to take part in any more media duties. Successive victories against West Brom and Aston Villa helped lift them out of the relegation zone and the former Wimbledon manager’s reward was a permanent appointment after two months in the caretaker role, although he was forced to leave his post three months later, in February, after becoming ill.In the first of four appointments that ensure they are responsible for half the names on this list, Chelsea turned to the Dutchman in February 2009 after the sacking of Luiz Felipe Scolari. Hiddink retained his role with Russia, whom he had just guided to the semi-finals of Euro 2008, but still managed 11 wins from his 13 league matches in charge and lifted the FA Cup. Six years later, he was back at Stamford Bridge to succeed the sacked José Mourinho, and set a record for the longest unbeaten streak as a new manager in the Premier League with 12.Having served as an assistant to André Villas-Boas for more than a year, Di Matteo stepped into the breach when the manager was fired in early March. Chelsea were outside the Premier League’s top four and 3-1 down after the first leg of their Champions League tie against Napoli. The former midfielder had an instant impact, with Chelsea overturning the deficit against Napoli and picking up an average of two points a game until the end of the season. Victories in the FA Cup and Champions League finals saw Di Matteo handed the role permanently but he was out of a job by November.Di Matteo’s abrupt departure left Chelsea in need of another rescue act and it surprisingly came in the form of the former Liverpool manager. A deeply unpopular appointment given his previous allegiances, Benítez was booed before his first match at Stamford Bridge and subsequently urged to apologise to supporters for comments he had made while at Anfield. Despite the fractious atmosphere, Chelsea recovered from their poor start and Benítez ended his tenure by winning the Europa League.A rousing victory against Cardiff in his first match after stepping into Michael Laudrup’s shoes helped the Swansea stalwart settle into his temporary role. Swansea avoided relegation with one game to spare. That was enough to secure him the job on a full-time basis and Monk guided them to eighth the following season. A three-year deal proved to be a curse, however, as he was sacked in December 2015, following a run of one win in 11 league matches.“I’m the best coach in the Premier League,” insisted Carver after a club-record eighth successive defeat left Newcastle perilously close to the trapdoor. They ended up surviving relegation by the skin of their teeth but it was not enough to save the man who had also served a spell as caretaker after Sir Bobby Robson was sacked in 2004. Carver collected only 13 points from his 19 matches. His last post was as manager of the Cypriot side Omonia, where he lasted less than seven months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/837297a5391a94f6f4d7e4876eb3c06ee1a162d3/254_16_3246_1948/master/3246.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33c92099b3dbe17be7f60000240bdb8a","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool wolves","story":"• Manager says 105 points may be needed to secure title• Virgil van Dijk scores first Liverpool goal since his debutJürgen Klopp hailed a “very mature” performance after Liverpool beat Wolves 2-0 to ensure they will spend Christmas Day top of the table but the German warned that it was no time for a party and said that as many as 105 points could be needed to win the title this season.Mohamed Salah’s 11th Premier League goal of the season and Virgil van Dijk’s first for the club since he scored on his debut against Everton helped to secure a seventh successive top-flight victory for Liverpool, who now have 48 points from 18 matches and remain unbeaten. Klopp, however, believes that Liverpool may need to improve on that record in the second half of a season that he described as “exceptional”.“Forty-eight points before Christmas, it’s just crazy, but there are other teams there as well,” said the Liverpool manager, whose side’s lead will be cut back to one if Manchester City win at home against Crystal Palace on Saturday.Klopp was particularly pleased with the professional way in which his team went about the task of overcoming a Wolves side that have an impressive record against top-six opponents this season. “It was very mature,” he said. “The heavy rain made things very hard. Both goals had nothing to do with the things we did in the game but we were quick in the mind in two set pieces.”Wolves missed the chance to go above Manchester United into sixth as their three-game winning run ended. They go to Fulham on Boxing Day and their manager, Nuno Espirito Santo, praised his team’s performance.He said: “It was a tough game. They have a very good pace and caused us many problems but we stayed in the game. I’m not so happy with the way we conceded but I’m proud of the work of the boys and we keep going. This schedule now is going to be tough for all the team.”"},{"url":null,"title":"the 100 best male footballers in the world 2018 nos 100 71","story":"Our panel of 225 experts from 69 nations have had their say and Luka Modric has been crowned our No 1"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3be4c8f5b796432073ea737ef7136ff45f91bce/0_0_4031_2419/master/4031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f55adcf280bdda56b1301d47db30d2a7","title":"football then and now interactive quiz part six","story":"Can you identify these 10 football stadiums from the historical photographs?

My Nokia 3210, unveiled the previous year, was state of the art. Competitively priced, lightweight (we thought) … there were even different coloured covers!Fast-forward 18 years and my daughter Alice – 12, new to phone ownership and not easily impressed – is examining this piece of communication history. In her first year of secondary school, with her interests and independence growing fast, Alice uses a smartphone to communicate with friends, organise activities, listen to music and take photos, as well as to contact and be contacted by us.In recent years, parents of communication-hungry tweens faced a predicament: offer their child a smartphone with unfettered access to the world wide web (and everything that comes with it) or pick up an older phone, with limitations imposed by more primitive technology. Now, thankfully, there’s a third way.Alice will be comparing the Nokia with the Verve IMO S2 with monqi – a new phone exclusive to Tesco Mobile, and designed specifically for children and young teenagers easing into mobile technology. How will it and the classic Nokia shape up in her fickle fingers?First up, the Nokia 3210.“It’s really heavy,” she exclaims. “The screen is tiny. It looks old.” She is examining the handset with the sort of sceptical curiosity she might extend towards a fax machine, or acarrier pigeon.“I guess you could call people and text them,” shesays. “Very slowly,” she adds, noticing the three-letters-per-key setup. No emojis. That’s not good. Her face briefly brightens as she spots the hash key. “Wait. What did you actually use that for back then?”The lack of a camera bothers her even more than the no internet access, presumably because the latter is available via our home computer. Not being able to listen to music is another shortcoming.With her reaction so far fairly scathing, it is time to reveal the phone’s killer feature: Snake! This, initially at least, is a hit. “That’s quite good!” she decides, setting about the game. Her initial enthusiasm proves short-lived. “Actually, it’s pretty boring.”Asked when the phone might have been designed, Alice hazards a guess at 1990. At almost triple her lifetime ago, that is ancient history for her.Does the 3210 have “old skool” appeal perhaps? “No,” she says firmly. “Retro is good in clothes, but not in phones.”Case closed. On to the IMO S2 with monqiThis, it would seem, is more like it. “It looks nice. It feels smooth to hold and use and it has a good-size screen – not too big or too small,” says Alice, back in her comfort zone.First of all she checks out the photo options, pulling a series of silly selfie faces. There are two cameras, I tell her, peering at the manual. “Of course there are, front and back,” she says, raising an eyebrow at my ignorance.“It’s really easy to work out,” she says, connecting to the wifi and starting to browse the website of a clothing brand she covets. As well as online window shopping, Alice uses her phone to watch clips from favourite films and musicals, to research and help with homework (foreign language dictionaries for example), and to stream music and contact friends via – parent approved – social media.She makes the odd phone call too, mainly to me, often to ask if she can go to a friend’s, and frequently followed by a call to request a lift home.Taking photos is a favourite pastime, and Alice likes the editing features on the IMO S2. She quickly starts to play around with tints and effects, writing captions and adding characters to her pictures.Intrinsic to the IMO S2 is the monqi operating system, which enables parents – having installed the parent app on their own phones – to monitor and shape how the child’s phone is used.Functions include: setting time limits on usage (remote shut down at homework or dinner time, for instance), blocking unsuitable internet content (monqi’s bespoke browser has built-in filters), monitoring internet and phone usage in real time, and checking on whereabouts. There is also a family chat option – a controlled alternative to third-party messenger apps.“Parental controls are a good idea, especially for younger children when you definitely want to know they are only seeing appropriate things,” says Alice, as she scrolls through the monqi functions.She admits that time limits make sense too. “Especially at first it’s good to make sure it isn’t being used all the time. I do lots of other activities, which keep me busy, but it can sometimes be tempting to have my phone on too long, especially if lots of group conversations are going on.”Having a smartphone has been helpful for settling into secondary school, she says – facilitating new friendships and enabling her to keep in touch with old classmates too.“A smartphone makes it easy to swap numbers and send a message or join a chat with your school friends,” says Alice. “With an old-style phone you would have to call someone direct, and that would feel more daunting,” she adds.The monqi system ensures this is all done safely new contacts are approved through the parent app, so mums and dads get a chance to check they are legitimate and appropriate.The IMO S2 meets with Alice’s approval. “Your parents look after you, and this setup is another way of them doing that. I’d be very happy to have this phone,” she says.Although used to tales of her parents’ seemingly prehistoric analogue childhoods, her foray into early mobile phones has given her a new sense of how technology has changed. “It has made me really appreciate how much we can do now.”Not having today’s smartphone technology would make her life more complicated, she says. “I think we are very lucky today. Maybe those early phones were ok for someone older,” she says in a placatory tone, looking straight at me.I think we have a winner.Visit Tesco Mobile to find out more about the IMO S2 with monqi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0896450882ebe852943fe6091e587c189199152/0_72_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47fc95829c1d7604f2df0a51ea6be8b2","title":"i feel more independent one 11 year old on her first year with a phone","story":"Amelia, aged 11, from Bristol shares her experiences of phone ownership – from the ‘contract’ she signed with her parents to getting lost on the way to schoolI finally got a phone last September, just as I started secondary school. I was one of the last people in my class to get one and it felt like I’d been waiting forever. Most of the others had one in year 6. My parents said I didn’t need one, as I was only walking down the road to school. But I think it would have made sense.Negotiating a contractWe talked a lot before the phone arrived. Mostly about when and where I could use it. But I was happy I was allowed a smartphone! I know one girl who just has this old-looking one. My parents and I decided we’d come up with a kind of contract between us. This is what we agreed:I was mostly OK with the rules. But not the social media one, as loads of my friends have Instagram! It was an improvement on the first version, though. That one said I was only allowed my phone downstairs!Coping with peer pressureThe phone has changed my life. These changes are mostly good, but I do feel that some bits have not gone quite as well. You feel like you can never make a mistake in a message.One of the better things is I feel more independent. I can plan when to see friends without asking my parents. If I walk 40 minutes to school the phone makes me feel safe. When I first started the walk, I took a wrong turning and ended up lost in the docks. All I could see was boats! Thankfully, I could call my dad. He helped me.But I sometimes feel my parents get cross with me more often now. The other day I was on my phone messaging and my mum started getting annoyed. She told me it was unhealthy to spend so much time looking at a screen, and I should “interact more with the real world”. I got angry and shouted back.Getting used to phone lifeAt first I thought it was a bit weird that my parents could look at my phone whenever. But I don’t really care or notice now. I don’t go online much. I mainly use my phone to chat or play games. I use the computer in the kitchen for the internet.Sometimes my phone distracts me. If I’m in the middle of a conversation and I get a message, I’ll turn to my phone instead. And if I hear a notification, I’ll rush to check my phone.But I’d never be without my phone now.Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9ebdfd732764928a71b7c35bef8b8818823df55/0_19_1714_1028/master/1714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8ab69a94870b46e156bb355d81f43a7","title":"quiz litty shook or goat can you talk tween","story":"Finstagram, spilling tea and looking snatched.

Family and friends only want to eat and drink? Help is at handIt is traditional to start worrying about your fitness in the new year. Like most traditions, there is a fundamental lie at the heart of it. You did not wake up on 1 January feeling huff-and-puffy. You’ve been worrying about it since November, or before. Indeed, you may have been trying to get fit since then – and if so, yule becomes not a respite but a pain, since you’re likely to be holed up somewhere, with very little scope to do anything except eat and drink, maybe not even in your own house. There are hardly any gyms open, and your friends and family are ready with a caustic remark if you show any sign of wanting to exercise. How do you stay fit, maintain your tiny bit of progress, over this fortnight?Helpfully, I’m going to cover the whole gamut, from fitness you can do if you genuinely don’t want anyone to hear you doing it, through little workouts that you don’t mind being mocked for, to full-on training for the person whose family is perfectly well aware of their healthy inclinations, but doesn’t want it rammed down their throats.The best silent workout is yoga give it half an hour a day, in your room (or your nephew’s old bedroom), some time when you might reasonably be expected to be asleep, and no one will know. Don’t forget your mat. Follow a Yoga With Adriene YouTube video, if you like (on mute). Slightly more noisy than this is a standard resistance bodyweight workout: press-ups, planks, tricep dips, squats, wall-sits. You don’t need equipment, and could do it in three sets of 10 minutes (or try Shona Vertue’s chair-only routine, below). If you have resistance bands and are feeling bold, you can do a not-bad workout while you’re cooking, by looping it around your thighs and doing side lunges (though do check the moves online, otherwise you might be building up a really peculiar muscle group that you won’t use again until you’re roasting another 25-pound turkey).For advice for the serious athlete, I asked Jo Pavey, five-time Olympian, ambassador for Saucony. She will take her family to a forest or some exciting outdoor space, and do a run while they have a Christmas picnic. “If you’re at someone else’s house, there’s always a hill nearby. I’ll get a lot of benefit from a hill session: just run from the doorstep, up a steep hill, come back.”As a general rule, if you want to do the same amount of good, with less disruption, try harder. “Try a tempo run, where you run at an uncomfortably hard pace for 20 minutes,” Pavey says. “The training boost is massive.” If you can dragoon other people along with you, there are often Reindeer runs – mixed-ability fun runs, on Boxing Day or thereabouts.“Don’t forget some off-road shoes,” Pavey adds. “Local football pitches are empty on Christmas Day – you can use the markings to do interval sprints. But whether you’re an elite athlete or regular self-improving inidual, if you take a break on the day itself and just enjoy it, that’s not going to kill you.”There are 290 calories in a portion of Christmas pud. That’s three sets of 200 squats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b875bada91df0fec4d8de12538dd4d79702402b/0_842_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f897c7fece02fb841f3a9e0c5e3c7c7","title":"quiz alien hand alice in wonderland stendhal stockholm thomas eaton","story":"From bossy to Bothnia, test your knowledge with the Weekend quiz1 Who scripted the first royal Christmas broadcast in 1932?2 What landmark stands on Mount Lee in Griffith Park?3 What bird has two species, common and ocellated?4 What were targeted in the Baedeker Blitz?5 In horse racing, what result comes between a dead heat and short head?6 What Washington’s army crossed on 25 December 1776?7 Who was tied to the underworld for eating pomegranate seeds?8 Whose Christmas Rappin’ was one of hip-hop’s first hits?What links:9 Bascinet cuirass cuisse gorget greave pauldron sabaton?10 Sophie Germain Mersenne Eisenstein strong twin emirp?11 Bossy (1) Naughty (2) Sunshine (4) Scatterbrain (12) Inventor (38)?12 Christina Rossetti yesterday Gustav Holst and Harold Darke?13 Bothnia Riga Finland?14 Alien hand Alice in Wonderland Jerusalem Stendhal Stockholm?15 Bryan Adams Smashing Pumpkins Taylor Swift Prince?1 Rudyard Kipling (for George V). 2 Hollywood sign. 3 Turkey. 4 Historic English cities (Exeter, York, Norwich, Bath, Canterbury). 5 Nose. 6 Delaware River. 7 Persephone (Greek myth). 8 Kurtis Blow. 9 Parts of a suit of armour. 10 Types of prime number. 11 Little Miss characters (Roger and Adam Hargreaves). 12 In the Bleak Midwinter: wrote poem midwinter (winter solstice) 2018 set to music. 13 Gulfs of the Baltic Sea. 14 Names given to psychological syndromes. 15 Adding a decade: Summer Of 69 song 1979 song 1989 album 1999 songalbum.• Eaton’s Modern Ready Reckoner: Essential Everyday Trivia, by Thomas Eaton, is published by Blink at £9.99.

That window is closing fast.On Thursday, I refuse to buy a tree for what I imagine will be the last time, but Friday comes and goes without my wife mentioning it. That night, we have people round, and I think: it would have been nice if we’d had the tree up by now.On Saturday, the weather is terrible. That night, we go to a party where the guests are standing around a decorated tree. Tomorrow, I think.But on Sunday morning we are both hungover and no one speaks of trees.On Monday, my wife raises the subject before she leaves the house, and I make it clear that I am extremely busy. My reluctance to act is based on the fact that I refuse to embark on the expedition if there is no one to go with me. Buying a Christmas tree is a family ritual, at least in my head.“I have a meeting,” my wife says on Tuesday. “Do you need the car?”“I would need the car,” I say, “if I was going to buy a Christmas tree.”“That’s fine,” she says. “I’ll take the bus. It’s probably easier.”“OK,” I say, but I think: I am probably not going to buy a tree today.By midday, however, I have come up with a plan: I make an elaborate meal for two, and when it’s almost ready, I go up to the middle one’s bedroom, where he is still sleeping.“Do you want lunch?” I ask.The heap beneath the duvet is silent. I begin to close the door.“Yes,” the heap says.“Ten minutes,” I say.Halfway through lunch, I spring my trap. “After this,” I say, “we go get a tree.”“I’m going out,” the middle one says.“Where?” I say.“Out,” he says.After lunch, I return to my shed. At some point I look out the window and see my wife eating Twiglets at the kitchen table. I cross the garden and pull open the door. “You and I could go get a tree right now,” I say to her. Such an expedition would be rare, but not unprecedented.“I’m not going anywhere,” she says. “I’m knackered.”“You know what?” I say, walking back out of the door. “If nobody else wants a tree, I don’t want a tree. That’s fine! I’ve got plenty of shit to do.”There is a problem, however: I don’t actually have anything to do, and I have now committed myself to sitting in my shed for an indefinite number of office hours, pretending to be busy.I stick it out for as long as I can before skulking back to the kitchen under cover of darkness. Through the window I see the middle one sitting where my wife had been sitting some hours earlier. He is also eating Twiglets.“You’re back,” I say, stepping inside and wiping my feet.“I am,” he says.“You chose a convenient window to disappear,” I say.“I did,” he says.I head for the sitting room, but stop before I reach the door.“Actually,” I say, “we could go to buy a tree now.”“What?” he says. “No!”“You and me, in the dark,” I say. “We’ve never even tried that.”“I just got home,” he says.“This is London,” I reply, “a busy city full of people with shit to do! We could probably buy a tree at midnight if we wanted to!”“It’s 5.30 in the afternoon,” he says.“Exactly!” I say. “Let’s go!”“Fine,” he says.He slams both palms on the table, pushes himself upright and slides his feet into already tied shoes.As I pull on my coat, my wife leans round the sitting room door. “Don’t get a big one,” she says. “We’re not even here for Christmas, and it’s just a waste.”“We won’t,” the middle one says, pulling the front door closed.As soon as we’re in the car I turn to him. “By the way,” I say. “We’re buying the biggest tree they have.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e714f9590fb40a93577a78e888a6024a4f3cda8e/260_282_3772_2263/master/3772.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3ab9e4889c6faa894b98073f0bd26802 960w","title":"im an asylum seeker ive not been allowed to work for three years","story":"Rose was trafficked from Nigeria to work as a prostitute. She escaped and started a new lifeI was 21 when I was trafficked from Nigeria to London. I was helping out washing dishes in a cafe in Lagos when a woman promised to find me a job overseas. I kind of regarded her as a mother figure as my own mum had recently died from a terminal illness.I was tempted. I’d just gone through unbearable pain. Before my mum passed away, she’d suffered a lot of abuse from my father’s family when my dad died. My mum was blamed for his death. They called her a witch and accused her of killing my father. She was tortured. She was made to go through a process that no one should ever go through.Around the same time, I was being forced into an arranged marriage with an older man and made to undergo female genital mutilation. I ended up running away from my home town and moving to Lagos. I thought this woman would help change my fortunes that I’d move abroad and make money by helping out in a factory or cleaning houses and I could send money back to my 11-year-old sister.Instead I was shocked to discover that this woman had organised for me to be a prostitute. I was told that I had to pay back the money used to bring me here. It was less than human. It was against every basic belief and right that I knew. We weren’t allowed out on our own. There were always men guiding us. They made us swear an oath that we wouldn’t disappoint them. They abused us. We were forced to do unthinkable things. It was hellish.It only came to an end five years later when I was in a hair salon in Peckham, London, where I was allowed to spend time learning how to do African braids. A female customer came in and spoke Hausa, a language spoken back in Nigeria, and started asking me if this was my job. I ended up telling her my situation and she promised to help me. She came up with a plan to meet her one evening, and so I escaped and stayed with her. She was a cleaner and so at first I used to help out on her jobs. After a while I started fending for myself, and I met someone and we started a family.Since then I have applied for asylum so I can stay in the UK and the Home Office has moved myself and my son and daughter to Bradford. I’ve not been allowed to work for three years. I have always wanted to better myself by gaining some form of education and so last year I completed the level 2 diploma in health and social care. I was about to register for level 3 but the college said because of my status I am not eligible and so would have to pay the £4,300 myself. It broke my world. It reminded me that even though I’m safe, I’m still a prisoner. I don’t have freedom. I cannot work … I want my son and daughter, aged 10 and seven, to see me as someone doing something, not sat at home doing nothing. I’m grateful, but it’s not me.The house we live in is crumbling but at least we have a roof over our heads. We live off an allowance of £100 a week. The kids cannot get the basics they need. The money is mainly spent on food. My daughter was lagging behind in school, especially in maths, and so I enrolled her in private lessons. It’s £30 a week – it’s a big sacrifice but I want their futures to be better than mine.I’ve tried to integrate by joining the local church and volunteering at an Oxfam shop. I sometimes buy clothes there with my staff discount. I want my kids to see me doing something. We want the chance to work while we’re waiting. Idleness eats into your brain. At times I’ve been suicidal. I don’t want this life for myself. I could be working and contributing to the system. What they give is not enough. We want the chance to work ourselves. I want my kids to see me as a role model.Refugee Action helps refugees and people seeking asylum to build safe, happy, and productive lives in the UK. The charity wants to lift the ban which prevents people seeking asylum from being able to work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc0f61009cd7c2adf23efcabae9c37c33f2e48c7/0_214_6500_3902/master/6500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffb0b170e9ef51f88d1f96427b7fd0a4","title":"lithuania iceland banking revolut","story":"Revolut customers are protected by the Bank of Lithuania – but it’s not certain it will pay upIt is almost exactly 10 years since the 300,000 British customers lured into Icesave by high interest rates woke up to find that their £4bn in deposits had disappeared when parent company Landsbanki collapsed and the country’s entire financial system went into meltdown.Iceland’s deposit protection scheme instantly fell over. How could it not? A tiny country with a population about the same as Brighton found itself as the guarantor for savers across Europe, with Dutch as well as British savers heavily invested in the Landsbanki accounts. Today, we’re told, it’s all different. Banks have been forced to raise more capital, supervision and solvency testing is muchmore robust, and the EU has set a €100,000 (£90,000) minimum deposit protection level for member states.But let’s take a look at Lithuania, a country of 2.8 million people, where average wages are about a third of those in the UK. Its central bank, the Bank of Lithuania, is keenly promoting itself as a go-to hub for fintech (financial technology) companies.Its own website – and this is the regulator, not a commercial bank – tries to entice new banks to obtain their EU licence in Lithuania, promising “smooth authorisation” and a “cooperative attitude”. Extraordinarily, it even promises “no regulatory sanctions for the first year of operations”. Why would any bank regulator want to make such a remarkable statement?This would be of little interest to us if it concerned just Lithuania. But once a start-up obtains a banking licence from Lithuania, it can, under the EU’s “passporting” rules, operate anywhere across the union.Last week, London-based Revolut, one of the fastest-growing smartphone-based banking services in the UK, announced it had obtained its European banking licence and will start accepting deposits as it “edges further towards its goal of becoming the Amazon of banking”. Revolut is based in London’s Canary Wharf, here so you might expect its licence would come from the nearby Bank of England. But no, the new licence is from the Bank of Lithuania.Already Revolut has 3 million customers. That’s more people than the entire population of Lithuania – and it transacts more business every year than Lithuania’s entire GDP.Revolut, in its press release, boasts that “the new banking licence will allow its customers to start depositing their salaries, which will be protected up to €100,000 under the European Deposit Insurance Scheme” (EDIS). The release makes no mention of Lithuania.But the thing is, EDIS is just a proposal made by the EU in 2015. As a Europe-wide guarantee of deposits, it doesn’t yet exist. It is understood that some EU countries, led by Germany, have blocked its introduction, understandably concerned that they will be the backstop if other countries’ protection schemes fail.Just last week, Reuters reported that at a meeting of EU finance ministers, “mistrust among eurozone countries is so great that they could not even agree on a roadmap for beginning political negotiations on EDIS”. Until (or if) EDIS is established, anyone who deposits money in a bank that operates under an EU licence must rely on the viability of the deposit protection scheme of the inidual country that issued the licence. So Revolut customer deposits will be dependent on the Lithuanian scheme’s capacity to pay up. If it can’t, there is no formal mechanism for the EU to step in.There is nothing to suggest that Revolut is under any financial pressure, and it is extremely unlikely to fail. But it’s always worth asking the question, given what happened in the great financial crash. Revolut assures me the Bank of Lithuania supervises banks in the same way as other central banks in the EU, and it is in the EU-wide “single supervisory mechanism” (SSM).The Bank of Lithuania tells me that apart from the SSM there is also the new “single resolution mechanism” to wind down banks in a more orderly fashion than in 2007-08, and it says the EU is in the “final stages” of creating EDIS.But as things stand, the EU has foolishly created a single market for banking, while failing to put in place a single mechanism for protecting savers. And don’t even ask why a UK-based bank is obtaining an EU passport weeks ahead of a possible no-deal UK withdrawal from the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d445b90ee5aa17950e85fc83cb85875a0a0bfdb1/0_120_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73463175b419a179afaa6c5aaffea5d6","title":"tell us what was your album of 2018","story":"We will publish a selection of readers’ favourite albums before the end of the yearAfter canvassing over 50 of our music writers and totting up their votes, we’ve announced our 50 best albums of the year, topped by Christine and the Queens’ sensual neo-boogie classic Chris.But a list of 50 –\u0026nbspand you can see the whole thing here – inevitably misses out out dozens of brilliant albums, so we’d love to hear from you about the recordings you think were unfairly overlooked by our vote.

In an exclusive interview, Corbyn also:Twenty-four hours after the furore in the House of Commons in which he was accused of insulting the prime minister, the Labour leader appeared much more relaxed on a visit to the Hope Centre, a homelessness charity in Northampton whose campaign against eviction he is supporting.He admitted he had lost his temper when confronted with a wall of jeering Conservative MPs at prime minister’s questions after May had accused him of lacking a clear Brexit policy.“I was extremely angry: the last point I’d made was, they’d suddenly found £4bn to prepare for no deal. £4bn. At the same time, police officers have lost their jobs 100,000 vacancies in the NHS, a housing crisis a homeless man dies on the steps of Westminster and she and the Conservative party turned the whole thing into some pantomime joke,” he said.Conservative MPs challenged Corbyn’s claim that he muttered “stupid people” and not “stupid woman”, as many viewers of video footage believed.But he was unrepentant. “It’s interesting their sudden concern about these matters. Where is their concern about the homeless people of this country?” he said, repeatedly jabbing a finger on the table to emphasise his point.“Where is their concern about universal credit? Where is their concern about 200,000 children living in poverty in this country?”The prime minister was taunting Corbyn for declining to table a motion of no confidence in her government – as some shadow cabinet ministers wanted him to do.Instead, he exasperated many of his own MPs by putting down a symbolic motion criticising the prime minister – which the government refused to allow time to debate.“The reason I tabled the motion in the way I did was to try and maximise support around the specifics of the vote in the House,” he said. “The reason I took that judgment is I thought it was the best way and the best chance.”With the clock running down to 29 March, when Britain is due to leave the EU, a vocal group of Labour MPs – including some in the shadow cabinet – are pushing for the leadership to endorse the idea of a “people’s vote”.But asked if he could imagine a referendum emerging as a solution if it becomes clear that parliament is deadlocked – as the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, mooted this week – he said: “I think we should vote down this deal we should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”As to what stance Labour would take if a referendum were held, Corbyn said, “it would be a matter for the party to decide what the policy would be but my proposal at this moment is that we go forward, trying to get a customs union with the EU, in which we would be able to be proper trading partners.”And he struck a distinctly Eurosceptic note by again highlighting Labour’s concerns about the state aid rules that form part of the architecture of the single market.“I think the state aid rules do need to be looked at again, because quite clearly, if you want to regenerate an economy, as we would want to do in government, then I don’t want to be told by somebody else that we can’t use state aid in order to be able to develop industry in this country,” he said.Neither is he willing to countenance the idea that Labour should support May’s deal, to avoid Britain crashing out with no deal in place at all – a move the prime minister has repeatedly said is in the “national interest”.“The national interest is for parliament to have a vote on this deal now,” Corbyn said, pointing out that it was May who had pulled the vote, which MPs had agreed to hold on 11 December.“They reneged on that. And then she suddenly turns round and starts accusing us of playing politics with it. She’s the one that reneged on the deal. Not me.”In his party conference speech, Corbyn surprised some activists by saying Labour could back the prime minister’s deal if she secured a permanent customs union and offered stronger assurances on workers’ rights and environmental standards.He said that offer remains open. “It’s there: at no stage since I made that in October has the government been in touch with us at all.”“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”In Northampton, after hearing the personal stories of three of the Hope Centre’s clients, Corbyn said Labour would act quickly to end rough sleeping, which has more than doubled since 2010 to 4,751 – a figure charities believe is a drastic underestimate.The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, has announced that a Labour government would allocate £100m to buy emergency cold-weather accommodation for rough sleepers, part-funded by a levy on second homes.Corbyn said he would also repeal the Vagrancy Act of 1824, which criminalises rough sleeping and begging. It dates from the period of the Napoleonic wars, when destitute soldiers were returning from the battlefield – but was invoked almost 3,000 times in 2016.“It’s an absolute relic of the kind of politics of the Duke of Wellington, being used against people now, on the streets of this country. Can’t we just move on from the Duke of Wellington, and get rid of it?” he said.He said he was “very, very disappointed, and very sad” about the case of Onasanya, who was suspended from the party after being found guilty of repeatedly lying to avoid a speeding ticket.Onasanya, along with the Sheffield Hallam MP, Jared O’Mara, who remains an MP despite resigning from Labour, was selected for 2017’s snap election by a small panel of members of the party’s ruling national executive committee (NEC).“In any future election, we’ll have a much more democratic process,” Corbyn said. “It was no secret I was not happy with NEC panels selecting candidates.” He added, “I’m very determined that the party membership should be enfranchised in doing this. I’m very clear about that.”He said Labour was “very ready” to fight a general election, if the impasse at Westminster resulted in a snap poll – and asked if he was ready to become prime minister, he replied: “Yes. Absolutely.”He joked that he would take with him to Downing Street a reconditioned garden fork, bought during his visit from a social enterprise run from the Hope Centre’s workshop.Meanwhile, with business at Westminster suspended for the Christmas break, Corbyn said: “I’ve got an appointment with my allotment on Sunday.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa8cfdbfbdf24b86b8f4a16b3b97259ae42bba65/17_167_2320_1391/master/2320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=189c5ee8a13b137eb967f1688c5da419","title":"frankie boyle review 2018 forget brexit","story":"It’s been tough to find much to laugh about this year. But Britain’s most savage satirist is going to give it a go...Consider the plight of the satirist. I know you’ve got your own plight, and there are only so many plights that you can consider at any one time, and that the plight of the satirist might even seem to you to be one of the easier plights. A satirist, you imagine, is having a pretty heavy week if they do more than pop up on The News Quiz to say that every MP in the DUP looks like a committee member of a bowling club who’s just seen a visitor enter the bar wearing jeans. And now that you put it like that, yes, you’re right, it’s not much of a plight at all, really.The plight of the satirist, such as it is, is a compulsion to look at the grimmest, most important thing they can think of, and then for reasons that probably wouldn’t survive a really good therapist, try to make it funny. To try to address the iniquities of their society, the satirist must manufacture some hope that what they’re doing might make a difference, then type it all up and send it off somewhere before they remember that it never does. Looking back over the events of this year is a bit like holding a doll for a therapist and pointing to where the bad man hurt you. Among the lowlights were:1 Theresa May dancing on stage at the Conservative Party conference (choreographer Ray Harryhausen), looking like an uncloaked Dementor on a hen weekend.2 A group of deranged kippers burning a cardboard effigy of Grenfell tower. They were later quizzed by police, and Kensington and Chelsea council, who asked them to quote for some public housing projects. 3 A senate grilling of Mark Zuckerberg, who gave the general impression of a Batman villain whose backstory is being given puberty-delaying drugs by a paedophile, and who seemed visibly relieved to be questioned on privacy concerns rather than Facebook’s monopoly power.4 The continuing media fascination with Jacob Rees-Mogg, a man who has all the authenticity of a character at a murder-mystery weekend.5 Philip Hammond delivering a budget speech so dry it was sponsored by Vagisil, making watching for 75 minutes feel like a gateway drug for necrophilia.6 The hilarious emergence of the phrase “rules-based international order”, which I like to imagine pronounced with the jaded, lisping irony of Gore Vidal, drunk on his deathbed.7 The Palestinian right-of-return marches that demonstrated the old Israeli proverb, you can’t make an omelette without shooting protesters. Trump said the US was “fully committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement”. The lasting peace that will come about once Israel has shot all the Palestinians.Beyond that, the year broke down into four seemingly unending and increasingly apocalyptic chapters.Domestically, the year was dominated by the Conservative party successfully externalising its bitter isions on trade. They have never, in their whole history, not been fighting about trade: trade laws are to the Tory party what ownership of the Queen Vic is to EastEnders.Theresa May was always only a placeholder prime minister, something that would appear to make about as much sense as using a slice of Victoria sponge as a bookmark. At the time of going to press, she had survived a vote of no confidence from Tory MPs, and there was the general impression that European leaders had agreed to end freedom of movement just to stop her from visiting them. Throughout the year, Boris Johnson has maintained that dishevelled, confused look of the people at the end of a disaster movie being ferried to the ambulances. He resigned as foreign secretary in July, barking “Chequers is dead” as if he were in an Agatha Christie novel and had just discovered the body of the butler at the bottom of the stairs. Johnson has promised a bonfire of EU regulations, a teetering one, without fencing and namby-pamby safety glasses, so that we can wipe the drifting cinders from our newly liberated eyes screaming, “Fuck you, Brussels! Maybe I want to be blind!” I look forward to a UK without EU red tape, and vegans weeping in supermarkets that resemble a cross between a botanical freak show and a fruit-and-veg hospice.I say, let’s forget the worries of Brexit for a week or two, and just enjoy our last Christmas with running water. Brexit has many downsides, but I think it will be nice for the Irish to watch a British famine. Personally I look forward to a new age where the London Christmas lights won’t be turned on by vacuous celebrities, but by someone found guilty of “talking foreign” and sentenced to complete the circuit. A time where we no longer guess the fluctuations of the market, but our high priests stare into polished heads, newly bald from radiation sickness, and interpret the patterns cast by the light of flickering sewer-fat candles.Paradoxically, I think Brexit will actually lead to less nationalism: economic collapse meaning that borders lose all their current toxicity, as they’re constantly redrawn in a never-ending struggle between regional warlords, antibiotic-resistant microbes and organ-harvesting cyborgs. Our children will have less inclination to dwell on skin colour as they’ll be preoccupied with appeasing the whims of some pitiless, scab-encrusted Cyclops waving a horse’s hoof nailed to a broomstick, roaring for fresh meat as he plays his three-note national anthem on a ribcage xylophone.It is at times like those that we will remember the work of Dominic Raab, who resigned in November, having decided that he could not endorse a deal that he himself had negotiated. Raab didn’t want to be Brexit secretary, but he didn’t have the negotiating skills to decline the job. When Raab took over, I was heartened by the thought that negotiations were being handled by someone with the air of an embattled leisure centre manager, who could be outmanoeuvred by a statue of Stephen Hawking. Surely better withdrawal terms have been negotiated during prison sex. Much of the Brexit discourse has revolved around people who seem inbred telling us that ersity is bad, but there don’t seem to be any easy solutions. In a way, I envy the touching optimism of people who feel that another referendum might clear up all this bad feeling once and for all.The Labour party somehow managed to achieve a Brexit position more incoherent than a government of opportunists at war with itself. There is definitely something odd about Labour supporting free movement for goods and not, well, labour. Meanwhile, May tried to attack Jeremy Corbyn’s handling of antisemitism while in the middle of the Windrush scandal, which was like Pol Pot complaining about gender balance in the films of Martin Scorsese. Corbyn has mastered a lot of things, but strangely not saying shit just to get elected. Mate, say some shit just to get elected: it’s really your only job right now. This needs to go to the top of your to-do list, not somewhere down below “fix the spare room door”.And yet, he has undoubtedly been travestied by a press who must somehow contrive to terrify Middle England with a man who looks as if he celebrates New Year’s Eve by edging the lawn. Corbyn was attacked in August after the Daily Mail printed pictures of him laying a wreath for some Palestinian martyrs. Corbyn argued that, just because he was near the graves of terrorists, didn’t mean he was honouring terrorists. Personally, I’m surprised our politicians find the time to lay so many wreaths when not one of them has poured liquor on the ground for Tupac.Perhaps some idea of how Britain intends to deal with the post-Brexit world is encapsulated in the Dickensian figure of the secretary of state for international trade, Dr Liam Fox, a man for whom Another Day, Another Dollar means the proposed minimum wage in our trade agreement with the US. You might wonder how a former doctor can cheerfully promote arms sales. Luckily, Liam’s brain has plenty of experience hosting seemingly irreconcilable contradictions: such as believing we should all stand on our own two feet, while claiming expenses of three pence for a 100-metre car journey in 2012. Liam Fox manages to be a grotesque moral nihilist and yet, somehow, not even the worst Dr Fox. Like me, he was raised on an Irish Catholic council estate in Scotland. It’s these sliding-doors moments where I have to thank alcoholism for denying me the focus to become a genocidal sociopath.Yet perhaps the clearest signpost to post-Brexit Britain this year lay in Boris Johnson, and later Prince Andrew, advocating the procurement of a new Royal Yacht. Andrew said that, for British exports, it would be a tool in the bag – despite having never used a tool, or carried a bag. There is no doubt that having Prince Andrew on such a boat could boost Britain’s reputation, provided it never docks.Of course it’s hardly the first ship the royals have had: that burned up entering the atmosphere after their journey here from their home planet, Azeroth 9. But how do you respond to the monarchy asking for a £100m boat? The history of European royalty suggests they’re going to be well ahead of any suggestion to “go fuck themselves”. On balance, I say stick with the royal train: we can always add an international dimension just by extending the tracks into the sea.The murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi Arabia is another very difficult subject to find the lighter side of, unless someone in the Ecuadorean embassy has clipped the story out and stuck it to the fridge. The 15 Saudi suspects have been banned from entering the UK, which is a shame as the people this hurts the most are the box office staff at Salisbury Cathedral. Turkey wants the murderers tried there, possibly because sticking journalist killers into a Turkish jail will really tidy up the lifers’ wing.You can imagine that this is all quite surreal for the Saudis they behead people in public, and starve the children of Yemen. The idea that they would be lambasted for killing a fully grown man in private with no witnesses must seem ridiculous it would be as if I had got into trouble for saying someone looked like a spoon.The murder was such a calamitous fuck-up from start to finish, I like to think that it’s got David Davis’s fingerprints all over it. Considering the version of events that the Saudis were willing to push, I’d love to see the ones they rejected. “We regret to inform you that Mr Khashoggi perished while attempting to rape an outboard motor.” They killed Khashoggi with a bone saw. No wonder they need to buy arms: their own weaponry seems to be sourced from the Whoops! shelf at Homebase.We apparently “share values” with the Saudis. After they behead someone (48 in the first four months of the year), they sometimes crucify the body in the public square for three days. Watching a horror movie in Saudi Arabia must have all the adrenaline buzz of a local council meeting. I’m guessing the most horrifying film you could screen there would be a remake of The Dukes of Hazzard where Daisy Duke drives her own car.Our government was angry about Khashoggi and sent the Saudis a strongly worded arms invoice. Perhaps it’s unfair to expect Britain to criticise the Saudis. Can we be expected to take the moral high ground when it comes to royal families sanctioning murder? Sadly, the only long-term consequences of Khashoggi being killed will be that, in future, when a Saudi diplomat orders a pizza, the Deliveroo rider will kick it the last few feet to the front door. Despite the long-running, disgraceful and illegal war in Yemen, there is no sign from Britain of a moratorium on weapons sales. So Britain, an international arms dealer, censuring someone for using its products would be as hypocritical as that bit when Willy Wonka rolls his eyes at Augustus Gloop.Saudi’s war in Yemen struggles to get much coverage here, despite the significant role Britain plays sometimes it seems that only journalists getting killed will engage the British press. In the US, the worst person you can kill would be a cop in China, a government official and in the UK, woe betide you if you touch anyone who’s mastered Pitman shorthand.Perhaps the saddest part of this whole business is knowing that there are so few British journalists committed enough to get murdered: you could silence most just by breaking the fingers they use to do select all, copy, paste. Nobody’s going to flay you to death just for barking offers of money through the letterboxes of recently bereaved parents, or trawling for offensive tweets with your free hand. Of course, there are a lot of good journalists. Perhaps journalist is now just too broad a term, in much the way the word actor encompasses everyone from Meryl Streep to Sooty.There’s no point asking how UK arms dealers sleep at night after watching footage from Yemen, as they’ll reply, “Very well: in fact my erection even stops me rolling out of bed.” Yet shouldn’t we, as a society, demand better? If we can set aside the moral element here (and I don’t know that we can, but just as an exercise in trying to recognise the sheer breadth of our current futility, it might prove useful), Britain sees its interests as almost synonymous with an industry that isn’t labour intensive, or environmentally sustainable, and that seems to be riddled with corruption, because it reminds us of what it was like to be powerful.Of course Donald Trump trundled out in front of the cameras like a corpse on a Segway and announced: “We are with Saudi Arabia, we are staying with Saudi Arabia.” I honestly think that the Republican establishment is just coming to terms with how useful Trump is – realising that this troll-doll King Lear, who looks like something you’d pick off a baking tray after cooking pizza above it, can say the things that they themselves would like, or find useful to say, but can’t because of some vestigial attachment to decency. The Republicans’ current attitude to Trump is of turning a blind eye to your racist builder because you just need to get the conservatory finished.Trump has not refashioned the GOP in his own image. He has achieved something more significant: he has managed to maintain a semantic distance from the Republican party despite cheerfully delivering its agenda. Meanwhile, the Democratic establishment has chosen to mirror his attachment to nepotism, entitlement and conspiracy theory – not that the conspiracy theory is necessarily invalid. Trump might, I suppose, be a Russian spy: it would certainly explain why he can’t speak English. It’s not that he’s normalising his own behaviour it’s that, by comparison, he’s normalising that of dreadful people everywhere. Jared Kushner, a bloodless, lipless demon, a dependent clause of the Anti-Life Equation who could be thrown into any Edgar Allan Poe adaptation and trusted to improvise, looks merely emo in comparison.The racial animus that Trump has cynically aggravated saw his supporters protesting Nike’s Colin Kaepernick advert in September. The Nike swoosh is now the sound their products make when they go on fire. One patriot filmed himself destroying his Nike clothing by cutting off the top couple of inches from his socks. Instead of destroying the clothing, he’s created an additional, free set of Nike sweatbands.What does it say about our times that we’re expected to look for moral guidance to corporations like Nike, whose brand message of “Just do it” started out as a looped PA announcement in their Vietnamese trainer factory. I’ve always been wary of Nike – I think because their single tick logo is so reminiscent of the one used in my youth for Bob a Job: just a glimpse of a trainer and I’m back in short trousers, fibre-glassing that pensioner’s loft for a shiny 50 pence piece. (If you’re interested it was 10p for the insulating, 40p for wearing the shorts.)Despite Trump’s rage, the taking-a-knee protests have continued. It’s odd, in most cultures going down on a knee is considered respectful: personally, I expect either a proposal or a medley of hits from Oklahoma. You have to hand it to the president it shows a certain ambition to try to undermine the idea of protest in a country that was founded by, well, Protestants. Trump has tried to make this about respect for a flag I very much doubt he could draw from memory, and for military service that he studiously avoided.Of course the NFL players are not actually protesting the flag. That would be as pointless as arguing with a sock, screaming at a table cloth, or a whole bunch of other stuff Trump probably does on a daily basis. The protest was originally about racial justice, and black people being shot dead by the police. You have to ask yourself how abusive a relationship has to be if even kneeling in silence is too provocative, how you are valued in a country where even the statement that your life matters ignites furious dissent.There is an obvious misogyny to the Trump administration, and the president no doubt has many supporters whose idea of foreplay consists of dropping a rope ladder down a well. This was highlighted by the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court, despite a confirmation hearing where he unspooled like a Columbo villain, bellowing endlessly about his love of beer. Trump ordered an FBI probe during the hearing, an investigation that was concluded with the speed of an airplane edit of CSI Miami. An investigation that ranged from the FBI agent looking at himself in the mirror and noting that Judge Kavanaugh wasn’t at that moment raping him, all the way through to noting that he hadn’t raped anyone during his time on television being questioned by senators.With Kavanaugh now on the bench, the irony for American women is that huge amounts of beer will soon become their only means of abortion. Should he be any kind of judge? There’s an argument that the very last thing you want to hand to any man accused of sex crimes is a hammer, but then again maybe we need his hands where we can see them. Still, it certainly is a very scary time for young men in America. Especially the ones aged 10 that Trump has put in cages.A climate of fearAt least Trump, looking like a cross between Dr Frankenstein’s first attempt and a tiebreak dinner for the contestants on I’m A Celebrity, came up with the solution to politicians only ever making short-term policies: he made sure there will only be a short term. This year he appointed a former energy lobbyist as head of the environmental protection agency, and announced his intention to change regulations that prohibited new coal burning plants. My guess is that the only concession Republicans plan to make to global warming will be to change the lyrics of America The Beautiful to “…from sea to boiling sea”.Climate catastrophe is imminent. Climate change could decimate pollinating species, leading to a world starved of fruit and vegetables. The best way to alert the world to that danger is to hold the next climate conference in Coatbridge, a town so short of fibre many residents can only shit successfully with the aid of a corkscrew. Perhaps we should try to look on the bright side. The colossal internet servers that provide the architecture for the modern world’s de-socialisation are based above the Arctic Circle. Should they burn out through lack of natural cooling, maybe people will look up from their phones and withered genitalia to once more make eye contact.The death of the planet seems almost too big to take in, doesn’t it? The real tragedy is not that we can’t prevent it. The real tragedy, I think, lies in the fact that we can. There are a lot of things we can change through political action, some small, some large, that would add up to saving the Earth.Consider again the plight of the children starving in Yemen. It’s a hard thing to consider. It’s OK to admit that, I think – that it’s hard to empathise: you don’t know much about it, you have your own plight, and it’s a difficult thing to think about. To consider that, in a world that has pub lunches, wristwatches, golden retrievers, the novels of Donna Tartt, the music of Kendrick Lamar, flumes and The Amazing Spider-Man, there is still a plight where you starve to death, as a child, for no reason.I mean, there is a reason, that I suppose has somehow made itself too obvious to mention. The reason is that some people are addicted to money and power, many of them pathologically so, and we let them do what they like. In our name, and with our taxes, we let them kill who they like in the service of their bored, baroque perversity, because we don’t care enough to stop them. We cannot seem to rouse ourselves, even as they move to turn the world into a consuming flame. We are running out of time to save the children of Yemen, and ourselves – and yet we could still, in theory, be redeemed.

It’s really very easy for any of us to conjure this image in our minds today, but it wasn’t always so.The Earth in all its splendid majesty was seen for the first time on Christmas Eve 50 years ago, when it was captured in an image that changed not only the way we think about space, but how we think about Earth and our place in the universe.The picture was taken in the midst of the space race. Major William A Anders and the rest of the crew aboard the Apollo 8 mission were keenly aware of the pressures of their mission to orbit the moon, laying the groundwork for the first lunar landing that was still to come.A few years back, speaking at the Johnson Space Center as part of a BBC documentary on the mission, Anders recounted the experience. As they ascended into space he snuck a glimpse of Australia, he said. He tried to peak at his hometown of San Diego but it was covered by fog.Once they were a safe enough distance from Earth for further sightseeing, Anders perceived the glowing orb in the distance behind him, but the enormity of it didn’t register.“That’s when I was thinking ‘that’s a pretty place down there,’” Anders said. It was “kind of like the classroom globe sitting on a teacher’s desk, but no country isions. It was about 25,000 miles away where you could still recognize continents.”After two to three orbits around the moon, he and the crew began shooting photographs.“I don’t know who said it, maybe all of us said, ‘Oh my God. Look at that!’” Anders said.“And up came the Earth. We had had no discussion on the ground, no briefing, no instructions on what to do. I jokingly said, ‘well it’s not on the flight plan,’ and the other two guys were yelling at me to give them cameras. I had the only color camera with a long lens. So I floated a black and white over to Borman. I can’t remember what Lovell got. There were all yelling for cameras, and we started snapping away.”Earthrise – the name given to Anders’ iconic picture, one of the most lasting and memorable in the history of space travel, if not human history itself – would come a little bit later.Looking back on it year’s later, Frank Borman, the mission’s commander, said words failed him and his crew in the moment.On Christmas Day in the New York Times, the poet Archibald MacLeish, who like everyone else still on Earth had only as yet seen images broadcast on television black and white, put himself in the astronauts’ seats, attempting to capture the awe of what the Apollo 8 crew other astronauts would later experience, and has been called the “overview effect”.“To see the Earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the Earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold – brothers who know now they are truly brothers.”Suddenly Earth no longer seemed the center of the universe, he wrote. Logically of course many people had long known this, but Anders’ photograph had a way of confirming it.Writers and dreamers and scientists would return to that feeling of celestial displacement often over the years. In a 1983 short story Human Moments in World War III, Don DeLillo places a character in Anders’ viewpoint.After the mission was complete the photo would go on to grace the final issue of Time Magazine of the year, with the caption: “Dawn.”Broadcasting home, the Apollo 8 crew read from the Book of Genesis as the Earth rose before them, contrasted against the lifeless moon.“In the beginning God created the heaven and the Earth,” Anders said.For the astronauts, and the rest of us back on Earth, it was as if something new had been born and we could all perceive it for the first time together. We saw ourselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/968d3624c92f8c64608a36133776d2c81a5c8ffe/0_66_4401_2641/master/4401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31e8f7da2298d737ffc68e9c9a88cc1a","title":"alex goode saracens exeter premiership rugby union interview","story":"Premiership leaders head to Exeter on Saturday and their full-back says maintaining hunger when you have tasted success is always the hardest taskIt was hard not to feel sympathy for Alex Goode during England’s autumn internationals campaign. Not so much for his continued snub – the Saracens full-back is now well accustomed to life in Eddie Jones’s blind spot – but more for his role as guest pundit at Twickenham, inches from the pitch he so desperately still longs to play on.Hardly surprising however, is that Goode has been cropping up more and more on the punditry circuit, having appeared on both BBC 5 Live and BT Sport of late. For there are few with Goode’s rugby intellect around, not to mention his glittering CV, now 10 years on from his Saracens debut. “I find it quite easy to talk nonsense … to talk about rugby,” he says. “I’ve played the game for a long time and I think about the game quite a bit, so if I can give a few helpful insights into the day-to-day and what people are trying to achieve from what you see on the pitch, then great.”Most recently he was at Welford Road last Sunday for Leicester’s eighth consecutive defeat – their lowest ebb according to their head coach, Geordan Murphy – and so it is instructive to hear Goode discuss the Tigers’ demise as Saracens’s rise continues. “I saw a few comments on Twitter saying I was like a politician, being diplomatic and trying to find positive things to say about Leicester Tigers,” adds Goode. “I’m going to be positive, and do see positives for Leicester to an extent, but those who don’t see any positives want you to be doom and gloom and throw some grenades. That’s never going to be me. I talk honestly, but with a positive, constructive slant. You don’t have to be outrageous and Piers Morgan-esque to be on TV. People really want an insight, and if you can do that you don’t have to give wild opinions.”Leicester are England’s most successful club but their dynasty can only be talked of in the past tense. Saracens’s, meanwhile, shows no signs of ending any time soon. They are 22 matches unbeaten – their last defeat was last season’s Champions Cup quarter-final loss to Leinster and they may well be the only English side to reach the knockout stages again this term. Victory away at Exeter on Saturday would considerably reinforce their status as the Premiership’s finest.It is often asked of Saracens how they maintain their drive for success and Goode is well placed to explain, as one of the few surviving members from the days before Mark McCall arrived. “It’s what everyone tries to do in business and in sport,” he says. “How can you keep at the top, it’s the biggest challenge. I remember hearing from Andrew Strauss five or six years ago, he talked about how when he was England captain their whole goal was to be the No 1 Test team, everything they did was based around that. They got there – and then seven or eight months later they were fifth because they didn’t know what to do once they had got there.A couple of weeks ago Saracens found themselves trailing by five points at home to an injury-hit Cardiff Blues side at half-time and responded by chalking up another half-century. McCall said afterwards he was far from happy with his side’s performance despite the scoreline and Goode provides some insight as to why. “We have a great core group here and a coaching group who don’t sit still,” he adds. “We have a humility about us to know that we’re not the best team in the world and we can get better. But we judge ourselves by our own standards and we weren’t happy. It is tough because you have to live it day in, day out but if it was easy everyone would have a dynasty. That’s the challenge because everyone wants a challenge to knock us off the perch.”The same would have been said of Leicester not so long ago and this week the parallels with Manchester United and the Tigers have been in abundance. Goode, a football fanatic who flew to Russia for England’s World Cup semi-final against Croatia, also makes the comparison but does not believe Leicester’s decline is terminal.It is easy to bill Saturday’s trip to Exeter as a clash of the titans. A cursory glance at the Premiership table tells you that these two, by a distance, are setting the pace, even if the Chiefs are no longer unbeaten after their loss at Harlequins. The duo have contested two of the past three Premiership finals and it would a fool who bets against another at the end of the season. “It’s an unbelievably tough place to go and win, a really well coached team, brilliant players but we know when we’re at our best and we will have to be at our best,” says Goode."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e5d87c22624ef57602645ca85247187910544b5/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba50813dbbabc867f37d84b160c51b59","title":"best travel discoveries of 2018 guardian writers","story":"Castles and museums, beaches and cities, train lines and walking trails – plus gorgeous places to eat and stay.

After a pit stop at Mother’s Kitchen cafe (brilliant veggie chilli), it was on to the Palomar Observatory. The building’s vast white dome shone brilliantly against the gathering storm. Soon, hailstones the size of conkers crashed down and lightning flickered. The tour, set to booming thunder, was inspiring and the tech on show “super-cool” according to my fellow visitors.

Often it’s what you can see from a lighthouse that’s the highlight but Hilmar has reinvented Akranesviti – built in 1944, and gazing down on a smaller, older lighthouse a short distance away – as an arts venue. The acoustics inside are wondrous and the sustain so memorable that it hosts intimate concerts and recording sessions, as well as being used for art projects. The peninsula scenery is striking and Akranes is just an hour’s drive from Reykjavik – via the impressive 5.7km Hvalfjörður Tunnel.• Admission £2, on FacebookRobert HullMany British and European football fans, me included, initially, dismissed the idea of travelling to Russia for the World Cup for fear it would be dangerous, expensive and even potentially life threatening following the Salisbury attack. So much for cold-war paranoia. When I got over myself and went, I was bowled over by the grandeur of Moscow. It is as impressive as Paris, maybe more so, but with history and architecture unlike any other European city. It’s also friendly, welcoming and safe.

It has been operating since 1868 but recently someone had the bright idea of an accompanying long-distance footpath that would loosely follow the line, coinciding at the stations, many of them request halts. Most of the path is now open (final completion due March 2019), allowing walkers to hop on and off the train, building day walks or longer, with nights in pubs or B\u0026ampBs in towns such as Llandrindod Wells and Llandovery.• heart-of-wales KRHistoric buildings in gorgeous settings tend to get turned into five-star hotels but the Lazio regional government targeted budget travellers when converting 14th-century Castello di Santa Severa. Overlooking a sandy beach 50km north of Rome, the castle has been home to nobles, popes and German soldiers over the years but now its oldest part is a hostel with dorms (€25) and private doubles (from €65). The best bit is that Santa Severa’s railway station is 15 minutes’ walk away, with trains to St Peter’s and Trastevere taking about 40 minutes, so it’s easy to combine seeing the Eternal City with days on the beach.

Elos, best-known for its lively chestnut festival and great hiking, is high among the verdant peaks of the south-west, just off the road between Kissamos and the sands and lagoons of Elafonisi. Hungry after a walk and some beach inaction, we headed to Kamares, one of its four tavernas. My family tucked into goat stew while I ate a homemade gemista of peppers and tomatoes stuffed with rice, herbs, courgettes, onion and garlic. Local wines, bread and olives, plus the obligatory glass of raki (for non-drivers) followed, all proffered with an offhand Cretan friendliness. At the organic pharmacy opposite we bought a remarkably bitter herbal tea “guaranteed” to prevent colds. Best stop-off ever.AMI spent a week exploring Devon and Cornwall by train – a rover ticket allows three days of unlimited travel out of seven for £50 (nationalrail). The branch lines are brilliant: Liskeard to Looe, Truro to Falmouth and, best of all, St Erth to St Ives. Some say St Ives is twee and touristy but I love it. The legendary light, the higgledy-piggledy streets, the beaches, the old Sloop pub, the Barbara Hepworth museum, the Tate … We ate at the Old Custom House , a seven-table restaurant that had only been open a week. The Italian-inspired small plates – octopus and ’nduja stew, ox tongue fritters (from £4) – and sunny service made my favourite seaside town just about perfect.Rachel DixonCosta Rica is alive with wildlife. On a rafting trip along the Rio Blanco, my 12-year-old niece and I spied sloths and monkeys in treetops and crocodiles sunbathing at the water’s edge. But a night safari in the rainforest from Maquenque ecolodge sticks in my mind. As our group crept through the trees, it was the tiny creatures that caused the most excitement: a cartoon-like tree frog, bright green with bulging tangerine eyes and oversized feet a finger-nail sized toad a long-legged spider weaving its intricate web. Near the border with Nicaragua, in its own private reserve, Maquenque offers an immersive nature experience. The bird life is prolific, from toucans to giant parrots. Raccoon-like coati wander in packs turtles and caiman laze on logs in the lagoon.

The road runs out at this little fishing town on Galicia’s wild Costa da Morte. Seafood comes straight from the trawlers moored beyond the marina, the local albariño wine flows long into the night at €2 a glass, children stay out late and there’s a warmth to the people that confounds the region’s reputation for being out on a limb and under a permanent rain cloud. When the sun is out, which it was every day for our stay this summer, families decamp to sandy Lingunde beach just north of town for raucous fun. Its white sand could fool you into thinking you’re in the Caribbean – until you e into the water. Then you get a sense of why it’s called the Costa da Morte.Andy PietrasikOn a road trip in Italy this summer, we stopped for dinner at the village of Panzano-in-Chianti, about 40km from Florence. We’d come from Venice, via Bologna, and would be heading down to Rome, Naples and the Amalfi coast. I’d happily been eating pasta for almost every meal so far but the homemade ravioli that evening – stuffed with leeks and taleggio cheese, with a simple tomato sauce – beat all the rest. It was dusk and we sat on the terrace of Il Vescovino on the edge of the village, savouring each little parcel and sipping chianti classico and gazing over a panorama of rolling vineyards under a peach sky.• roncaratti70.wixsiteilvescovinoAntonia WilsonThe Essex-born guitarist Wilko Johnson had been invited to Seamus Heaney HomePlace, the arts and literary centre in the village where the late bard grew up, to give a talk about how he had cheated death. I was in Northern Ireland at the time and, being a fan of both, thought this was too good an opportunity to miss. The talk was morbidly fascinating. As was the fact that HomePlace, a Scandi barn-style building, is on the site of a once heavily fortified police station. But when I walked around the permanent exhibition about the Nobel prize-winner, with his family photos, school desk, and favourite duffel coat, any dark thoughts lifted, and I fell once again under the warm and avuncular spell of Heaney’s poetry celebrating a rural upbringing in Mid Ulster. • seamusheaneyhomeAPA concrete dome may seem an odd highlight from a visit to Japan but the Teshima Art Museum is extraordinary – architecturally stunning and strangely soothing. It’s not a museum is any of the usual senses. Designed to look like a water droplet at the precise moment it hits the ground, it’s an incongruous sight on the small island of Teshima: a low, white mound on grassy hillside overlooking the Seto Inland Sea. The wow moment comes as you step into the empty interior. Two large openings in the roof let light flood in. The ground is dotted with tiny holes through which spring water droplets bubble up and skitter across the smooth, coated surface. There’s a meditative quality to sitting on the floor and staring as the water forms endless patterns on the surface.• Admission £11, under 15s free, benesse-artsite.jpICYou don’t need a car on Rhodes – I travelled all over the island by bus, from Rhodes Town in the north down to the southern tip. Here I found Prasonisi, or “Green Island”. Despite the name, this uninhabited cape only becomes an island in winter, when sea levels rise. In September, a stretch of sand still connected it to the mainland. On one side is the calm, flat Mediterranean on the other, a few paces away, is the wild, windy Aegean. I walked around Prasonisi to a lighthouse on the far side, with only a few other walkers and wild goats for company. Back on the beach, I stopped for a dip – after all, there aren’t many places in the world where you can swim in two seas, two minutes apart.RDAfter a day of hiking, kayaking and sightseeing, I needed to relax and let what I’d seen of San Diego and its Pacific coastline sink in. I couldn’t have picked a better place than this cosy bar, with ing-gear decor, on a fishing pier at Shelter Island. Fathom serves local brews (including Pliny the Elder, a double IPA of great repute) and comfort food, such as homemade sausages and hot sandwiches. I shared the idyllic spot with owner Dennis Borlek. As we talked, he pointed over the bay at the skyscrapers of Downtown, a few miles away. “The sunset’s better if you don’t look towards it but see it reflected in those buildings. It’s magical,” he said. He was right.• fathombistroRHThere’s plenty to do at night in the ’Dam. Clubs come and go, some reclaiming industrial buildings or dockside warehouses. Looking for live music and good cocktails after dinner this time, we headed to Bourbon Street for blues and booze. Between taller buildings on the Leidsekruisstraat, it has been a live blues venue since 1990 but has added other genres in recent years – there’s now live music seven days a week, for around €3 admission. It was small, dark and the right kind of busy, and a mixed crowd went wild for a groove cover of Blackstreet’s No Diggity. It’s standing only, so great for an intimate gig and dancing to funk and soul into the early hours.• bourbonstreet.nlAWI’d read about overtourism in Barcelona but seeing it at first hand still came as a shock: the entire centre is as crowded and soulless as Oxford Street. Luckily, I was only passing through, on my way to an area of Catalonia that is the opposite of busy. The Ebro delta in the far south, on the border with Valencia province is a serene flatland sandwiched between the sea and the mountains, full of aquatic birds in the big blue skies,and pink flamingos lazing in the marshes, and ancient rice paddies (pictured) for which the area is famous. I cycled around the Ebro Delta natural park on an electric bike – a fun experience first for me after a lifetime of proper cycling and, oh, what a fun!. We finished our tour at Kensho, only the second sake producer in Europe, which makes it – made with local rice.

Physical weakness brings out childish silliness, and there’s sweetness in the singsong cadence of a fading voice. Moreover, you get the essence of the person, as things that are meant to be important melt away. When Mary Beard Met Clive James (BBC2) was such a conversation, a slaloming half-hour evidently pieced together from fragments of a longer, more halting exchange. But those fragments were precious.James announced in 2011 that he would not live much longer. Since then, advances in leukaemia treatment – and, it’s impossible not to think, his own insistence on continuing to write – have kept him going, with his unlikely survival measured out for a time in columns for this newspaper and, mostly, in poetry. Now the end really does look near, and the 79-year-old’s final book of verse is his new, 120-page autobiographical poem The River in the Sky.“As epics go,” James told Beard, “this is a) very short and b) remarkably happy. It’s content with the exit from life.” If that’s the case, this programme was a good companion to the book.For most interviewers, especially most big-beast male BBC presenters, the temptation to trade epigrams with the great writer, to portray the encounter as a joust between mates, would have been irresistible. But Professor Beard, seated behind a desk in James’s study in Cambridge, was cordial and admiring without simpering, and without provoking any of those dreaded moments where the interviewee’s eyes betray that they’re humouring a phoney.Beard was free to laugh, challenge, mildly flirt and find common ground on the esoteric points that pop up in natural dialogues. The pair agreed, for instance, that ancient Greece would have looked as garish as Disneyland back in the day, before time – “an aesthete”, according to The River in the Sky – had artfully weathered all the paint off.James fans heard him play a few familiar hits: that his memoirs are “true lies”, and that much of his life’s work has been based on the idea that “the stuff that doesn’t matter matters too” – in other words that high and low culture can be equally fruitful when analysed with the same disrespectful curiosity. “There was one thing I got right when I was a kid,” James said. “I found it all interesting.”The old man is still shining his light into new corners. Beard happily admitted that The River in the Sky leaps from an appreciation of Olympic ing to “some intellectual I have to Google to find out about”, and bookshops can today expect a run of orders for anthologies of Boston poet Gjertrud Schnackenberg, after James whole-heartedly recommended her, the name undulating out of his mouth with the same waggling twang he used to employ on his TV show to welcome the lounge singer “Margarita Pracatan!”James has always been the erudite all-rounder, a man who knows everything because he’s somehow found the time to read everything, and has in any case understood it better than you would have. His books are a shortcut to that wisdom, and a hoot to boot. His tip-off about Schnackenberg, though, was accompanied by a rare note of exhausted sadness: “The time has gone when I could read everybody. I can’t keep up.”You wouldn’t bet against him keeping it up for just a little longer. James promised a concluding volume of memoirs next year, and the biggest laugh came when Beard referenced his 2011 poem Japanese Maple, written about a tree in James’s garden that would surely outlive him. How’s the tree doing now? “It died!” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66a5a0b096268356ce861258afbb1b286f7c02b0/358_0_3583_2150/master/3583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13ede7128ad42c5737565cb148809f51","title":"saturdays best tv watership down goodness gracious me 20 years innit","story":"An eerie new version of Richard Adams’ classic novel debuts, while 20 years of the pitch-perfect British Asian comedy are celebrated To celebrate 20 years of the pitch-perfect British-Asian comedy, which first aired in 1998 and ended in 2001 (barring a couple of reunion specials), the cast look back at some of the show’s most cherished moments.

Delays of more than an hour are forecast from junction 8A of the M40 to the M42 link road.Traffic generally would peak between 10.30am and 4pm, the RAC said, advising drivers to travel before 9.30am or after 7.30pm.After a relatively quiet Sunday, traffic is expected to peak again around lunchtime on Christmas Eve, when delays of around 20 minutes can be expected on parts of the M1 in the east Midlands.The worst of the Christmas getaway though has passed for motorists, on so-called Frantic Friday, when leisure travellers mixed with regular commuting traffic. An estimated 19 million drivers were out on Britain’s roads on Friday, according to the AA.Queues of slow-moving traffic were adding almost an hour to inter-city car journeys north out of London on Friday lunchtime, with the M40, M6 and M1 particularly busy, while journeys west on the M4 and A303 were also slowed by around 20 minutes.Rail services will be disrupted over Christmas for engineering works – as well as strikes in parts. Beyond the usual shutdown for 25 and 26 December, a number of key rail services will either be closed or reduced over the coming 10 days. Network Rail insisted that the majority of the railway would be unaffected, although it would be carrying out work worth £148m on 330 projects over the holiday season.Beleaguered passengers who have not been automatically provided with a rail replacement bus could turn to the coach, with National Express set to lay on an additional seats for 50,000 passengers over the holidays – including Christmas Day, when all other public transport options have been dashed. According to Trainline, most coach bookings for 25 December have been made for a lunchtime exodus from London to Liverpool.Among the most affected rail services will be lines out of London Paddington, with the west London station closed for an additional three days in late December. Half of London Victoria will be shut down from this Sunday until the start of 2019, as work closes one of the main lines into the station from Clapham Junction, Britain’s busiest rail interchange. The Gatwick Express fast airport service will not run for the duration.Stansted Express services will be reduced during work on the lines east from the capital to London’s third airport. East Midlands and Thameslink trains running north of St Pancras will also be affected by engineering.Christmas strikes by the RMT union, in the ongoing row about the future role and responsibilities of guards on trains, will disrupt Northern and South Western railway services.

Another would set up new courts which critics say could be politically manipulated.MKKP’s gathering started outside parliament, where one protester brandished a placard saying “Happy boss, gloomy Sunday”.The Two-Tailed Dog party (MKKP), launched over a decade ago as a joke, has become a semi-serious force, using ironic humour to tackle practical issues. “I wanted to come because I consider the Dog party to be the most serious of all in the current lineup, which is rather sad,” said Almos Edes, 26, a university student holding a sign saying ‘We promise everything’ beneath a logo of Fidesz.Edes was sceptical of any change being triggered by the rallies, but said he had joined to make his voice heard.Friday’s rally also took aim at grievances including regulations that have led to the departure of the Central European University, founded by Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros, from Budapest.“We can finally work eight days a week. We no longer need to hassle with independent courts. Homelessness has been eliminated. Irritating foreign schools will vanish. And Soros, Soros, Soros, Soros, Soros,” said an invitation to the rally posted on Facebook.Orban has said the protests have been partly stoked by activists paid by Soros, an accusation Soros’s Open Society Foundation has denied.Demonstrators, subsequently joined by another rally called by opposition groups, then marched up to the presidential palace in Buda Castle, briefly blocking a bridge crossing the Danube River."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43cddfce65bd65eee7f15aab906287369b511edb/927_3714_5265_3159/master/5265.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f039e25eb9f3060274866ca0494373e1","title":"what happened next weekend stories 2018 blind date","story":"Did the arts campaigners bring change – and did any Blind Date couples make it official?

Stuart Heritage was getting through a mountain of nappies, and bought a SodaStream to try to reduce the number of plastic water bottles he used. His town now has a packaging-free shop, so his rice, pasta, spices and salt doesn’t even touch plastic. “Best of all,” he says, “one of our children poos in the toilet now: landfills of Britain, you are welcome.” Ian Jack, meanwhile, has now cut back on the takeaways and goes out for Chinese, Indian and Vietnamese: “Yes, we’ve cut back on the takeaways, and most of them these days are from a pizza place, that packs its pizzas in plain brown cardboard boxes that look very recyclable. If we want Indian, Chinese or Vietnamese food, we go out and eat it, though a favourite local Chinese takeaway, Zing Zing, now promises in its online manifesto that “most of our containers are recyclable and come from a supplier that uses socially responsible techniques during the manufacturing process.” Maybe more takeaways could adopt this practice. A lot of stuff in our refuse bins is still plastic, of course – bottles for shampoo, bathroom cleaner and so on – but I think less than before.Earlier that same month, Hattie Garlick reported on a scheme at Dartmoor prison, training inmates in mediation to encourage non-violent communication. Since then, the scheme has expanded – it now has 12 facilitators, six of whom are full time – and plans to expand to another wing next year. According to Maria Arpa, who is leading the project, staff have noticed that the Dialogue Road Map she introduced has increased safety on the wings for prisoners and staff.In April, John Harris wrote about families who have been separated by visa restrictions introduced by Theresa May during her time at the Home Office. The rules mean that if you meet someone abroad and want to live with them in the UK, you must be earning at least £18,600 a year the result is that around 15,000 children are thought to be living without one of their parents.Laura Clarke, who lives in Rugby with her son Elijah, is still fighting to be reunited with his father, Biniyam, who is stranded in Ethiopia. Under “exceptional circumstances” rules, she has once again applied for a visa for him, and spent thousands of pounds in the process. “Both Elijah and I have not seen Biniyam since early October 2017,” she says. “He’s missed another birthday and now he’ll miss another Christmas.”Tom Shelton went through a painful period in County Durham, while his wife Annie and her son were forced to remain in the Philippines. In October, he left the UK for six months to rejoin his family. “It’s great to be together again,” he says. “Wonderful and worrying at the same time.

There’s no ability to save.” Sally Williams’ report in May on women who carried the BRCA mutation, a gene that dramatically increases the risk of getting ovarian or breast cancer, encouraged more women to sign up for a study that Daniel Reisel, coordinator of the BRCA research clinic at University College London, had recently launched. Called BRCA Unite, supported by the gynaecological cancer charity the Eve Appeal, it is investigating what saves some women with the mutation and why.In May, Diane Taylor wrote about Jimmy Thoronka, a sprinter from Sierra Leone who three years ago was homeless and living in a park, after vanishing following the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Thoronka was finally granted discretionary leave to remain in the UK for two and a half years this April. He continues to train at the Mile End track in east London and is being coached by Lloyd Cowan and Clarence Callender. He is also working for Sainsbury’s, coaching children, and hopes to complete a course in personal training next year. He still lives with Taylor and her partner, Simon Hattenstone.Rupert Neate reported in May on the deaths of three young Britons while working for billionaires on multimillion-pound superyachts . Since then, at least two more crew members have died, including Rebecca Boyle, 32, a stewardess from London, who died on the Italian riviera this summer. A coroner found that Boyle died of injuries sustained when she fell on her way back to her cabin from the yacht’s hot tub. Meanwhile, the 40-strong crew of the Indian Empress – a $95m superyacht owned by former Formula One team owner Vijay Mallya – were awarded more than £700,000 in back pay, more than a year after Mallya abandoned the yacht and crew in Malta following his arrest on £1bn fraud charges.In July, Jonathan Watts and photographer Thom Pierce profiled seven environmental activists risking their lives to protect land around the world. In November, there was good news for Nonhle Mbuthuma: after a long and, at times, violent struggle against powerful mining interests, the Amadiba campaigner and her community won a landmark legal case in the South African high court. The judge ruled that the government must have permission from local people before it can offer mining concessions. Elsewhere, many activists continue to face enormous and often deadly dangers. On August 11, Weekend published a gal-dem magazine takeover, in which every byline, photograph and illustration was contributed by a woman or non-binary person of colour. That weekend saw an extra 7,000 copies of the newspaper sold an additional 500 copies of the magazine made available through the  Bookshop (a first) sold out in days. gal-dem editor and deputy editor Liv Little and Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff say the issue felt like “a defining moment in becoming a fully fledged business.It’s often the first thing people want to talk to us about”.In September, Sally Williams reported on the family of Nur Begum, who are among the million Rohingya refugees sheltering in the world’s largest refugee camp in Bangladesh. The family is now facing its second winter in the camp. The Bangladeshi government announced it would begin repatriations to Myanmar in November, but the transport buses remain empty. “There is likely to be a further push next year,” a spokesperson from Oxfam says. “It’s clear that it’s not safe for refugees to go back, and there’s little progress on granting them the equal rights that they want.”Nur has since become unwell. “She has a cough,” her daughter-in-law Zaheda says, “so she is staying close to the camp’s medical centre.” But there was good news for Rashida, 25, Nur’s youngest daughter, and a mother of four, who had been abandoned by her husband Jamir: he has since returned. “They are happy,” Zaheda says, “and I am feeling happy about that. I long to go home, but we are afraid of what could happen to us in Myanmar.”In September, writer Dina Nayeri went to Katsikas refugee camp in Greece with Refugee Support, to report on how the charity is trying to revolutionise the way camps distribute aid. Since their visit, Katsikas has doubled its capacity to 1,000 refugees after adjusting to the number of new arrivals, the mini-market that Refugee Support opened there is thriving. It launched a pilot Empowerment Fund in July, where it asked people in the camp for business ideas to promote self-sufficiency – it has so far funded 12 ideas, from bike hire to pie making.Joe Hammond wrote about his terminal diagnosis of motor neurone disease, and why he is writing cards and letters for his young sons to open on their birthdays after his death. He has now completed 26 of his planned 33 cards, typing the final seven after the weakness in his right hand made his handwriting illegible. “My body is failing fast, but life remains richer than it ever did before,” Hammond says. Since the article appeared, he has corresponded with a huge number of  readers who lost a parent as a child, while 4th Estate publishers bought world rights to the book. Hammond can now do very little for himself in January, he will have a feeding tube fitted.Also in September, Anna Moore told the story of Sally Challen, who is appealing her life sentence for murdering her husband on the grounds that she was a victim of coercive control throughout their marriage. Sally’s hearing has been postponed twice, and is now listed for February 2019, more than two years since Sally’s grounds for appeal were originally submitted. Sally’s son, David Challen, describes the wait as “excruciating”. Meanwhile, on 22 November, Justice for Women – the campaigning group behind Sally’s case – won leave to appeal for Emma-Jayne Magson, who is also serving a life sentence for killing her partner.In October, Jess Cartner-Morley reinvented her column to reflect the new eco-aware mood in fashion. She was, she admits, anxious about how the piece would be received. “I worried that the truly ethical would shoot my efforts down for not being rigorous enough, because I still buy and recommend new clothes, as well as championing ‘shopping’ from your existing wardrobe. Also that my front row crew would drop me, Mean Girls-style, for being photographed in clothes that cost £30 a decade ago.” But the reaction was overwhelmingly positive. “Some of my favourite responses were from fashionistas who confided that they were cutting down on new purchases, too.”Josh Jacobs revealed the abuse and misuse of MPs’ staffers in October. Since the article appeared, the House of Commons announced that Gemma White QC will launch an independent investigation into Westminster work culture. Jacobs has received calls and messages from yet more staffers and their families, telling stories of being demeaned by their bosses.In November, Sarah Boseley and David Levene reported on how the Democratic Republic of Congo is stamping out sleeping sickness. the same month, the European Medicines Agency approved fexinidazole, the first simple oral pill for the disease that used to kill thousands and for which, until a decade ago, the main treatment was drugs derived from arsenic. It will transform prospects for those infected by the bite of the tsetse fly and could help eradicate the disease by the WHO target date of 2020. It’s a triumph for the Congolese doctors and their government programme, and for the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative.And what of our Blind Date couples? We ran some numbers on this year’s columns and found that the average dater scored their evening an impressive 7.93 out of 10. There were kisses shared on eight dates and six people awarded their date a perfect 10.We asked all our daters what happened next of those who replied, at least four couples made it to a second meeting. MA student Sophie and solicitor Emily’s date in July has blossomed into a full-blown romance. “We had a second date before the article was even published and have been seeing each other ever since,” Emily says. Meanwhile, illustrator Lizzie and book editor Tom gave each other full marks in May 2017 – and announced their engagement in April this year. “We are so grateful as we would never have met otherwise,” Lizzie says. “We’re very, very happy.” They have invited Nina Trickey, Weekend’s cupid, to the wedding.While other dates didn’t lead to love, they did have life-changing consequences. Both Laura, a digital marketing manager, and Richard, an employment lawyer, used their moment in the spotlight to come out of the closet. “I had a hugely positive response,” Richard says. “It lifted a massive burden from my shoulders. It’s one of the best things I’ve done.”Want to find love next year? Email blind.date@the• Commenting on this piece?

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe In the porch, Fr Sean Henry welcomed them. “You are her family today,” he said to the neighbours and townspeople who had arranged and fundraised for the funeral of a pauper who had lived amongst them.As the procession entered the large and beautiful church, organist Miriam Mooney played In the Bleak Midwinter, beginning what might have been a bleak funereal occasion, but which became uplifting.Margaret Lang was known to many in Trim as the lady in the high-viz jacket. She was a solitary figure for the most part, padding harmlessly about the streets, greeting people as they hoved into view helping out here and there (especially with the St Patrick’s Day parade) and drinking rather more than was good for her.But everyone liked her. Somehow, Margaret wriggled her way into their affections. No one had a bad word to say about her, despite her somewhat dissolute life.There was a pattern to how she lived.Four days a week, she and her friend Dorothy Jones would meet at 10.30 in the morning, before heading off to the Judge and Jury pub.Margaret was last seen alive on Sunday December 9th, when she dropped into a neighbour in Mornington Green to borrow a cup of sugar. Next day, Dorothy called, as usual. Meeting no response, she got worried. So did others.On the Tuesday, Margaret was found dead inside the house, alone. She was just 58.It was assumed that she had no one in her life, no family, so Judge and Jury owner Richie Walsh sprung into action, along with local undertaker Declan Rispin of McEvoy’s.Funds would be raised, the community would rally and Margaret would be given a decent send-off. Donations were collected – mostly small sums of €1 to €5, accumulating quickly to over €6,000.Local garda Owen Ganley said he would try to track down relatives, if there were any apart from a son, separated from her as a baby when she was a teenager, none were known.But on Friday, John Neary from Mayo and Jean Ford from Liverpool, Margaret’s hitherto unknown half-brother and half-sister, were in Trim to say goodbye to a relative introduced to them only in death.“We shared a mother,” said Jean, adding that there were two more half-sisters, Kathleen and Mary, also living in England.“We never knew her,” John said of Margaret, “we never met the woman.”Richie Walsh showed them around the town, the places where Margaret had lived. Both were impressed by a community that had embraced her in life, and death.The 50 or so mourners sat at the front of St Patrick’s. The congregation was swelled by about a further 100 people, many of them there for the regular morning Mass.After reading from St Luke (Mary’s greeting of Elizabeth), Fr Henry said she had been “very much part of Trim”, recalling memories of a 1960s child who was “dressed like a model and had pigtails” and loved to play hopscotch.Margaret was not raised by her mother but by her grandparents, William and Sarah Lang, who were members of the Church of Ireland. William died in 1964, followed in 1983 by Sarah (by which time Margaret was 23), and Margaret “was heartbroken and alone”.The next years were “not happy”, said the priest, though Margaret was “held in much affection and high regard by her neighbours”.Soloist Gwen Bagnall sang Abide With Me, Amazing Grace and Be Still (For the Presence of the Lord) as Margaret’s coffin, dressed with a large spray of white lilies and greenery, was escorted from the church by Dorothy Jones and Margaret’s Mornington Green neighbours Mim, Michelle and Martina, organist Miriam Mooney played The Old Rugged Cross, a nod to Margaret’s Protestant heritage.As a single cathedral bell tolled, the Dean, the Very Rev Paul Bogle, said: “Christ entered our world as a vulnerable little baby. He identified with our human experience he knew joy and sorrow, love and pain.”She was lowered into the ground in the shadow of a mature Yew tree.Declan Rispin distributed long-stem yellow roses from a wicker basket. Margaret’s big family of friends, neighbours and newly found relatives tossed them into her, one by one.“We had a good laugh together,” said Dorothy. “We just clicked.”“She loved animals,” said Michelle. “She took in every stray dog.”But it was Martina who perhaps captured the essence of the moment.“She was just a gentle soul who deserved a send-off,” she said.She’s sharing her grave now with William and Sarah. Their headstone has fallen backwards, dislodged from its setting, and lies on the ground.Declan Rispin got a brush and some water and cleaned the slab, exposing their names – and ample space for Margaret’s.“We’ll get that fixed,” he said, wiping it down."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3740705.1545467727!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord unveils her winners and losers of the year","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney are winners of Double Act of the Year awardThis award is claimed outright by a very special group of men and women who exist in a peculiar political limbo reserved for creatures known as Ministers of State.These poor souls yearn for full Cabinet status and live in constant hope that somebody in the Taoiseach’s first XIV will resign, get sacked or run over on Kildare Street by the 67 bus – sooner rather than later.A delegation of Ministers of State from outside the greater Dublin area met Minister of Finance Paschal Donohoe this month and pleaded with him for more expenses as the cost of accommodation in the capital these days is astronomical.Under existing rules, a Minister of State receives a €94,535 salary as a TD and a ministerial payment of up to €35,319, pushing their earning power up to €129,854. They do not enjoy the same expenses regime as backbench TDs, and this rankles.Unfortunately, news of their tête-à-tête leaked and all the juniors got for their trouble was an overwhelming wave of derision from inside and outside Leinster House. Paschal sent them away with a flea in their ear.This one goes to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar who, having survived a toe-curling meeting with a bored-looking Donald Trump in the Oval Office, set off for Capitol Hill for the traditional Speaker’s lunch and lost the run of himself during a speech in front of the president and members of Congress.Launching into an anecdote about a conversation he had when minister for tourism with then businessman Trump, Leo told how the man who would become president asked if he could do anything about the proposed building of wind farms near his newly purchased Doonbeg golf resort in Co Clare.He said he rang Clare County Council on his behalf.“I tried to do what I could do. The planning permission was declined . . . The president has very kindly given me credit for that. I have to say it probably would have been refused anyway,” he added, modestly.And a trip which should have been a success ended up with Leo insisting he did not try to influence the planning process while, back home, Opposition TDs bellowed for an inquiry.This award goes to Helen McEntee, Mairéad McGuinness and Verona Murphy who, on the Brexit front, have been playing a blinder in Europe, and more particularly, in the UK.McEntee, the Minister of State for Europe, has been growing in stature in Brussels as she bats for Ireland in negotiations and at media briefings. She is a very able stand-in for Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney when he can’t attend meetings. She has also handled media situations with bullish UK Brexiteers with understated authority.MEP McGuinness has been a rock of sense in a sea of confusion, misinformation and meat-headed ignorance, calmly stating the case for Ireland and the European Union as Brexiteering MPs and Anglocentric journalists wilfully try to misinterpret her plainly-put statements of truth. Her stock in Europe has never been so high.Wexford woman Murphy, head of the Irish Road Haulage Association, has become a much sought-after commentator about Brexit and its effects on business. Her impressive grasp of her brief and knowledge of the transport sector has left many Leave cheerleaders floundering. So it comes as no surprise to hear that the trucking expert, who puts the articulate into articulated, is currently being courted by the Fine Gael with a view to her running for the Dáil in the next election.Just one other thing. Is it absolutely necessary for Leo Varadkar to have Helen McEntee standing silently at his side during every photo-op in Brussels and at every impromptu doorstep interview? Is her seat in Meath so vulnerable that he has to do the Sinn Féin trick of pushing candidates into every TV shot and camera frame?This goes to Michael Lowry after his Long Walk to Freedom in June when he emerged from Dublin Circuit Criminal Court with a “fantastic result” after “22 years of turmoil”.The Independent TD for Tipperary and former minister for communications, who was excoriated by the Moriarty tribunal for his involvement when minister in the awarding of the State’s second mobile phone licence to Denis O’Brien’s Esat Digifone consortium, left court in “a free man” with nothing but four convictions for tax offences against himself and his refrigeration company along with an overall €25,000 fine and a trifling three-year disqualification from acting as a company director.The runner-up in this category is Shane Ross, who had a run in with his constant tormentor Mattie McGrath in the Dáil canteen after McGrath had been giving him a tough time over his proposed drink-driving law.Mattie was having lunch with his daughter when Ross, aka Winston Churchtown, came tearing around the corner, shouting the odds.“You’re a bollocks. You’re a f***ing bollocks,” Winston told a startled McGrath in the course of an expletive-laden tirade. Winston then disappeared around the corner, only to re-emerge and start the name calling again.But the winner is journalist and anti-abortion activist John Waters, who took the hump during a podcast with Eamon Dunphy and stormed out of the studio.“Aaah, don’t go!” pleaded Dunphy as his guest departed having been asked to define when life begins.“This isn’t a fair interview! You’re a bollocks! You’re a f***ing bollocks! You can f*** off, Eamon! . . . Talk to Una Mullally. F*** off.”This goes to Ivana Bacik for her tireless work, stretching back to her student days, on the abortion campaign. And for her great energy in promoting Votáil 100, the centenary of womens’ suffrage.The winner here is Daily Mail journalist Joanna Bell, who was ejected from the Irish embassy in London last week for her drunken heckling of Ambassador Adrian O’Neill during a reception. Bell, originally from Dundalk, interrupted him as he spoke about the possibility of a second Brexit referendum.Afterwards, she contritely revealed that “a good lunch with an eccentric aristocrat” was the reason for her “excessive robustness.”The eccentric aristocrat, by the way, is the Hon David Roper-Curzon, who is set to be Lord Teynham when his 90-year-old father dies.As she was being escorted down the stairs, Bell shouted: “This is because I am pro-Brexit.” Also on the stairs, but heading in the opposite direction, were Jeffrey and Mary Archer.Mrs Archer shouted after her: “I’m a Brexiteer and I’m not being asked to leave. This is about manners, not politics.”And then Jeffrey cried: “And I’m a Remainer!”No. Not the Pope. Francis delighted his many followers when he visited in September, but what was supposed to be the highlight of his trip – Mass in the Phoenix Park – was something of a damp squib due to rain and a low turnout.The award goes to Minister for Culture Josepha Madigan, who was the subject of one of the most unexpected political stories of the year when she was forced to go public and deny that she had celebrated Mass in her local parish church when the priest failed to turn up one Saturday evening.What actually happened is that she led a prayer service with fellow parishioners in the absence of a priest so that the congregation were able to worship, albeit in a different way, having made their way to church.And she got a rap on the knuckles from Diarmuid Martin, the Archbishop of Dublin, for her trouble.Committees are often overlooked, but certain TDs and senators put in a lot of hours and hard work at this unglamorous end of politics. The Public Accounts Committee is a different animal. It gets a lot of attention and, consequently, it is often used by grandstanding TDs to draw attention to themselves.Catherine Connolly, Independent TD for Galway, has been an outstanding performer at the PAC. She is calm, measured and incisive. She asks her questions and she gets her answers. Job done.If only others – yes, Marc MacSharry, we’re looking at you – could do the same.This one is being shared by Mattie McGrath, Michael Collins and the Healy-Rae brothers. Rarely a day goes by in the Dáil without one of the four kicking up a stink about how rural Ireland is on its last legs, dying on its feet with its people broken and beaten down by “them above in Dublin”. They paint a pitiful situation of life beyond the Pale. If you were to spend too long listening to their bellyaching, you’d begin to wonder why anyone at all wants to live in rural Ireland.There is good and bad in rural and urban living. This forever complaining quartet, despite what its members might believe, doesn’t have the monopoly on bad luck stories in the Dáil Éireann.Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan is still marooned in the Seanad, months into the Upper House’s consideration of the Judicial Appointments Bill. Senators, particularly those with legal backgrounds, are holding up the progress of the Bill by tabling countless amendments and talking for Ireland.They are ably marshalled by senior counsel Michael McDowell, who is having a filibustering field day and enjoying every minute of it. He hasn’t looked so happy in years. What could make him happier? Word is that he would love a Dáil comeback.Meanwhile, Charlie must endure the meanderings with fortitude. It’s Winston Churchtown’s pet project, but he doesn’t have to listen to the senators droning on. Charlie has clocked up almost 70 hours of duty – it’s like he’s doing community service in the Seanad. The debate has reached section 38 of the Bill, and there are more than 60 to consider. And all the while the amendments fly in.Bród and Síoda.By popular acclaim, and a landslide victory, Michael D Higgins.This goes to Simon Harris for his achievement in leading a difficult abortion referendum campaign from the front, steering it to an overwhelming vote by the people to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution and overseeing the introduction of legislation to allow the provision of abortion services in Ireland. He was present in the Seanad on the night of December 13th, along with those who campaigned for decades for Irish women to have autonomy over their own bodies, when all stages of the Bill passed.The winners are Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney. Despite being rivals for the party leadership last year, the two have worked together very well on the Brexit issue. They have presented a united front and remained steadfastly on message. Their sure-footedness and grasp of the issues is in marked contrast to the Brexit shambles lurching between crisis and farce across the water.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin is the clear winner. From his surprising Dáil announcement in January that he was not only supporting the campaign to repeal the Eighth Amendment but was also in favour of the introduction of abortion within a 12-week time limit, to his decision to continue supporting the Government next year so it can be free to concentrate on Brexit issues, Micheál has put in a strong and principled performance in the thankless and difficult role of leader of the Opposition. He is also saddled with a parliamentary party team which is far from united, with some actively working to undermine his leadership.It may be that he knows he doesn’t have the numbers to come out on top if an election is called in the next 12 months, so stalling in the “national interest” isn’t such a bad idea. And while his decision to support the recommendations of both the Citizens’ Assembly and the Oireachtas committee on abortion was deeply opposed and resented by a large rump in the party, he emerged as the one most in tune with the will of the people.The decision to continue the confidence-and-supply arrangement with Fine Gael may backfire on him, and is very unpopular with many activists, but the public may take a different view and reward him for taking a noble stand at a time when Ireland faces potential grave national crisis."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

She tripled in weight over the course of the 20 months she was in their care.The foundation originally planned to create a 12 acre forest island for Alba, rather than release her into truly natural habitat, because of health issues related to her albinism. Veterinarians worried that she would be impaired by her poor sight and hearing, and struggle with the possibility of skin cancer.Alba, shortly before her releaseBut the government\u0027s natural resources conservation agency and other agencies decided it was appropriate to release Alba into the wild because of her strong physical condition and intrinsically wild behaviour.She will be electronically tracked and regularly monitored by a medical team.Alba has no inferiority complex as we imagined before. She is very confident compared to other orangutans, said Agus Fathoni, a vet.On Tuesday Alba, approximately five years old, was given final medical tests and anesthetized for the journey to the remote jungle reserve.Alba, released into the wild on WednesdayWorkers shouted Alba\u0027s going home as her cage was lifted onto a truck at the Nyaru Menteng Rehabilitation Center, in Central Kalimantan province, on Borneo.And on Wednesday, after a 24-hour journey by vehicle, boat and foot, she was released into the Bukit Baka Bukit Raya national park.Alba climbed away from her human helpers, scaling the trees, foraging for food and beginning to build a nest.Conservationists said the major challenge now was protecting her from poachers.I think the real threat actually comes from humans,” said Mr Fathoni.“What we\u0027re worried about is poaching where this very special condition makes her a target.Alba in the treesPatrols of Alba\u0027s new home by national park and conservation agency staff will aim to deter poachers, though they admit the number of personnel is limited.We don\u0027t have enough to cover all the area of the national park but we\u0027re confident of covering all the patrol lines that we have set, said Wirasadi Nursubhi, a national park official.Orangutans, reddish-brown primates known for their gentle temperament and intelligence, are critically endangered and only found in the wild on the Indonesian island of Sumatra and on Borneo, which is ided among Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei.The International Union for Conservation of Nature, which declared Borneo\u0027s orangutans critically endangered in 2016, says their numbers have dropped by nearly two-thirds since the early 1970s as plantation agriculture destroyed and fragmented their forest habitat.The Sumatran orangutan is a separate species and has been critically endangered since 2008.It\u0027s true this is a big gamble,” said Jamartin Sihite, chief executive of the orangutan foundation, after releasing her from the cage.“But we hope that with our collaboration we will win the big bet we have made today. Gatwick airport drone chaos: Man and woman arrested as passengers brace for more delays -

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

But is that reasonable?In 2017 Liam Fox famously claimed that concluding a trade deal with the European Union after Brexit would be the “easiest in human history” because we’d start from a position of already being fully aligned on tariffs and regulation.Such bullishness is notable by its absence now.Indeed, one of the reasons Brexiteers are so alarmed by the Irish “backstop” provision of the withdrawal agreement is that even they doubt that there will be a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU in place by January 2021\u0026nbspwhen the transition is supposed to end.But what are the prospects for trade deals between the UK and the rest of the world after Brexit? What deals could we strike with the likes of China, India, Brazil and other emerging markets?A glance at the international trade secretary’s Twitter feed\u0026nbspshows he remains upbeat on such prospects. Is this warranted?The answer is that it will depend\u0026nbspto a significant extent on what sort of trade deal the UK can get with the EU.Brexit is a mess, so why are MPs not postponing their Christmas break?Other countries are very likely to wait until they see how close we end up to the EU’s single market and the customs union before deciding, as that will impact the cost-benefit calculation of any bilateral UK trade deal for their firms and industries.If we end up closely aligned on customs with the EU that might limit our government’s autonomy to even forge independent trade deals on goods with third countries since we could be imposing the EU’s common external tariff.What about services? Well, presuming we’re out of the single market, that would give us more scope for services trade deals. And it’s true that services are a large and growing share of UK total exports.Yet the problem here is that international trade deals in recent years have been essentially about goods, rather than services.Another snag, at least from the perspective of sovereignty-obsessed Brexiteers, is that a service deal worth having would entail some degree of regulatory harmonisation, for instance recognising each others’ professional qualifications. Is that “taking back control”?Associated to that question is immigration. “A big ask of emerging markets when it comes to trade deals is UK visas for their nationals,” says Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform.That may not go down well with those Brexiteers who want less immigration from developing countries, not more.Finally, there’s “gravity” to think about. It’s an empirical reality that countries tend to do more trade with big economies that are closer to them than those that are further away.Even if we did successfully forge goods and services trade deals with lots of emerging market economies the results might well be disappointing to Brexiteers, like Fox, who have assumed big increases in trade flows.It’s for this reason that almost all Brexit modelling exercises, including the government’s\u0026nbspone, show only a modest gain to UK GDP in the long term from hypothetical post-Brexit trade deals with the rest of the world, with the damage far outweighed by the macroeconomic costs of introducing trade frictions between us and the EU.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But how could it look under a no-deal Brexit?Items that are grown in the UK won’t be affected, but those that are imported will become more costly as they will be subject to tariffs and other expensive trade barriers.Parsnips and carrots Let’s start with the good news. Parsnips and carrots are grown in abundance in the UK. They are available throughout most of the year and are rarely imported from abroad. So even a Brexit as hard as a raw parsnip is unlikely to affect this popular Christmas side dish.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialPeople with the Brussels sprouts-hating TAS2R38 gene are out of luck. Brussels sprouts are so abundant in the UK that they are actually exported around the world. The topical Christmas cracker joke, “How will Christmas dinner be different after Brexit? No Brussels” is unlikely to be true for the actual vegetable.These are the least recyclable Christmas chocolate wrappersAlthough the UK is a major potato producer, some potatoes and potato products still get imported to meet UK demand. This mainly applies to frozen or processed potato products such as frozen fries. Due to a large harvest in 2016-17, the UK is expected to be a net exporter of fresh potatoes in 2017-18. Fresh potato imports have been predominantly from EU countries, but traditional suppliers such as France appear to have found other markets. UK fresh potato exports are predominantly to the EU (98 per cent).So as long as growing conditions are favourable, there ought to be sufficient fresh UK potatoes to roast for Christmases to come.It is thought that sweet chestnut trees were brought to Britain by the conquering Romans and, like many other immigrants, they have naturalised and become an important part of the food chain. In most years\u0026nbspthe nuts grow to a reasonable size in the south-east of England. But in other areas it is unusual for more than one of the fruits in each husk to reach full size. They are generally not harvested in time for Christmas, but can be preserved by boiling and freezing.The fresh chestnuts you see at Christmas in the UK are mostly sourced from elsewhere in Europe. This is because sweet chestnut trees in the UK are threatened by both fungal blight and, more recently, the oriental chestnut gall wasp.If having reasonably priced quality fresh sweet chestnut imports is important to you at Christmas, Brexit could be a problem.Created with Sketch.

He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off – namely Emma Thompson’s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman.There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don’t expose it to the light, don’t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act “like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company”, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked.Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK – it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since – it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone’s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining.

They also make a good option for retaliatory tariffs against the US, the world’s largest cranberry producer. The EU took more than 50 per cent\u0026nbspof US cranberry exports in 2018, with the UK leading the way.That is not to say the UK does not have its own cranberries. The two native cranberry species in the UK are vaccinium oxycoccos (the northern cranberry) and vaccinium microcarpus (the small\u0026nbspcranberry). Wild harvesting used to take place in Scotland but, due to habitat loss, this is no longer done. As a consequence, the cranberries bought in UK stores are the species vaccinium macrocarpon. These are harvested in North America and Eastern Europe using a method that involves flooding the land, which is impractical in the UK.Vaccinium macrocarpon is also grown commercially on Terschelling, an island belonging to the Netherlands. The Netherlands is also a global trade centre for fresh fruit and vegetable imports and exported about €6m (£5.4m) worth of cranberries in 2017 (many of which were grown elsewhere).So the availability of cranberries in the UK is largely dependent on shipments from the EU. This supply chain arrangement may have to change after Brexit, particularly if the UK were to decide not to follow EU trade legislation. Depending on the flavour of Brexit, the costs of establishing a new supply chain independent of EU trade hubs and losing the economies of scale that the EU enjoys as a whole could lead to shortages initially and increased costs in the future.The majority of UK families opt for roast turkey on Christmas day. This will cost them more if there’s a hard Brexit.Turkeys are becoming more expensive to produce in the UK. Turkey producer Kelly Bronze’s prices, for example, are up by about 5.4 per cent\u0026nbspthis year and it has warned that a hard Brexit will affect its business by 70 per cent.A significant cost of producing turkeys in the UK is related to the labour cost of hand plucking. This relies on EU migrant labour and staffing for the Christmas peak and is a real concern. Brexit scenarios considered by farmers’ groups indicate that any deal affecting\u0026nbspthe labour pool is likely to lead to increased prices.For those not paying a premium for hand-plucked turkeys, any Brexit trade deals imposing tariffs or import restrictions on cheaper turkeys from the EU would not make them cheaper for the consumer. A trade deal with the US might provide the option of turkey meat marinated in chlorine – not necessarily to everyone’s taste.Strasbourg attack: Is it safe to visit Christmas markets in Europe?Elderly woman cuts down flashing Christmas lights in middle of nightCassetteboy remixes Die Hard to prove it’s a Christmas filmThe average number of turkeys slaughtered in the UK per week in December 2017 was half a million birds or about 2 million over the month. Allowing for the additional 1.6 million from November, the figure is still more than 6 million short of the estimated 10 million consumed at Christmas.Pigs in blankets The cost and availability of sausages wrapped in bacon is dependent on pork supplies. British farmers currently produce only 40 per cent\u0026nbspof the pork eaten in the UK. The other 60 per cent\u0026nbspcomes from EU countries such as Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands.So, as with turkey, a hard Brexit would lead to a rise in the cost of sausages and bacon due to either import costs or supply and demand issues.Christmas might only come once a year but Brexit is likely to make it even more expensive.Hana Trollman is a PhD researcher at Loughborough University.

A redesign sets out to show that to consumersClick to followThe IndependentWorkers at Suma in Elland, YorkshireWhen Sheree Hatton started working at the whole foods distributor Suma six years ago, she knew it was different to anywhere else she’d ever worked.Hatton lives in Halifax with her husband and young son. In her previous job in advertising and sales for a newspaper, she was\u0026nbspused to a hierarchical business with targets for workers. Suma,\u0026nbspa worker’s co-op where each employee owns a share of the business, offered her a chance to have a say in everything from overall strategy to day-to-day operations.\u0026nbspEating organic food lowers risk of certain cancers, study suggestsCould co-operative shops be the answer to expensive organic foods?Organic food healthier than farmed products, says new research“I knew Suma was different from what I had been used to,” Hatton says. “But the more I learned about co-ops, the more I realised that by feeding into business decisions\u0026nbspyou have an equal opportunity to say how the business should be run.”Suma is known as the largest whole food distributor in the UK. But fewer people know that Suma is also Britain’s biggest workers co-operative, with an annual turnover of £55m. More than 200 people now work at Suma after rapid growth in the last few years.\u0026nbspAll of them are considered equal. Every worker at Suma is paid the same salary of £33,000. They get the opportunity to work in every part of the business – including the canteen kitchen – on rotation at the company offices in Elland, Yorkshire. And they get to vote on business decisions. “We are an equal business and we’re very proud of what we’re doing here,” Hatton says.\u0026nbspBut customers, like Hatton, often aren’t instantly aware of Suma’s co-operative status or what that means, according to a survey they commissioned in 2017. “One of the embarrassing points was that not everyone knew that we are a co-op,” Hatton says. So in 2017, Suma workers decided it was time for a rebrand.\u0026nbspPearlfisher (Courtesy Photo)Suma was started over 40 years ago in the kitchen of a house in Leeds. Reg Taylor, owner of a small retail shop, proposed at a meeting attended by other wholefood shops in the north of England that they set up a wholesaling co-operative, to supply to each other, in 1975.The name Suma was first used when the business moved to a lock-up garage in Leeds. In 1977, the business was sold to seven employees who became the founder members of the Triangle Wholefoods Collective Ltd, trading as Suma.Suma has recently benefited as consumers have become more conscious of their health and the ethics of food, plus the growing popularity of veganism. The business introduced its own vegan line in September 2017. New vegan products, including the 2018 introductions of meat-free mini-burgers in tins, have helped sales grow in the last decade.Suma now sells over 7,000 products. The branding has evolved\u0026nbsphaphazardly as lines have been added. Workers knew from customer feedback that they needed a redesign to create a single identity across all ranges, including essential, body and home. Designers also wanted to position Suma at the forefront of the new movement for sustainability and contemporary food.“We really wanted to show off that it was a co-op,” says Harriet Ferguson, senior designer at Pearlfisher, the agency commissioned to do the work. “The existing identity didn’t really do that.” Pearlfisher designers added a tagline to the logo\u0026nbsp“Co-op since 1977” to make Suma distinctive against competition against younger brands. Then they designed a logo out of different shapes to show the different personalities in the co-op.“We called this our Suma of parts and used these shapes to create the logo type. This\u0026nbspdynamic pattern can be used on the packaging at\u0026nbspdifferent levels,” Ferguson says.Suma’s inhouse design team picked some of the trickiest products for Pearlfisher to work on in the redesign, including fiddly products with small labels, like pate tubes, and some that didn’t obviously fit into one range, like coconut products.Pearlfisher turned their designs into a set of packs for Suma’s inhouse designers to roll out across old and new lines. The agency also introduced colour palettes to make different products more identifiable. They used earthy tones for the basic products, simple colours for unprocessed food and bright, natural colours for processed pastas and peanut butter. For the premium products, like speciality coffee, they used a charcoal colour palette with pops of colour.The most important thing, says David Jenkinson, creative designer at Pearlfisher, was creating a sense of the collective in all the elements. “The new identity embodies the idea that this is a collective of iniduals,” he says. “They are aligned, they sing from the same hymn sheet, but they are different.”The new\u0026nbspcolourful logo, with its tessellating shapes, will be seen on lorries up and down the country and on tins and tubes of Suma products in wholefood stockists\u0026nbspfrom January.\u0026nbspWhole Foods releases its 2019 list of new food trendsA key part of Hatton’s job has been communicating the new design to staff internally. In a company where 200 people can vote on every small change, Suma needed a process to make sure the redesign wasn’t delayed by disagreements. “We didn’t want 200 people deciding what colours to use!” says Hatton. Instead the branding team built a case for the rebrand and wrote a business plan. They took the plan to workers, who voted it through. Then the designers were free to make decisions, with in-house work making sure workers were happy with the results.“It’s probably been a little slower, just generally because we’re trying to get consensus and make sure people are behind everything before we proceed,” Hatton says. Some longstanding members wanted to stick with the existing designs, because they saw that it had worked. Hatton and other Suma members listened to them and tried to alleviate any concerns. “In a typical commercial industry people just get told what is happening,” she says. “The difference is that we want people to be passionate about it.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas.

A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair.

Quentin Crisp, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Brigitte Bardot, Edward Snowden and Brendan Cox have all given past speeches.Dyer provided one of the TV highlights of the year\u0026nbspin June when he appeared on ITV’s Good Evening Britain -\u0026nbspas part of a surreal panel also including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and ex-Baywatch star Pamela Anderson – and launched into an impassioned rant against Brexit and former prime minister David Cameron.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Who knows about Brexit? No one has got a fucking clue what Brexit is, yeah.

He’s in Europe, in Nice, with his trotters up, yeah? Where is the geezer?\u0026nbspI think he should be held to account for it.\u0026nbspTwat.”In November, Dyer continued his diatribe against the British political class and the “age of food banks”\u0026nbspin The Big Issue.“Theresa May, bless her, just got that job by default,” he told the magazine. “Boris Johnson running around with his stupid haircut, spouting bollocks. Young people look and think: ‘If these are the people running the country, why shouldn’t I just go and loot and riot?’”“Politicians are just floundering around. They have been given this thing called fucking Brexit because of one man. One man. Who we voted in to be our prime minister, who purely for his own ego decided to call a referendum just to get rid of Nigel Farage.“Well, fuck you\u0026nbspCameron, you posh twat. Sorry. It backfired on him, didn’t it? And what does he do? He fucks off. He doesn’t like the way it went and he fucks off.”The Londoner’s plainspeaking on TV and on Twitter has made him a folk hero over the years and his vitriol on Brexit\u0026nbspsaw him become an immediate fixture in Cold War Steve’s satirical photomontages on Twitter, as high an honour as 2018 had to offer.Dyer – who first rose to fame starring in low-budget Cockney gangster films and as host of Danny Dyer’s Deadliest Men -\u0026nbspwill also address American politics in his Christmas Day broadcast, describing Donald Trump as an “absolute melt”. He previously asked his Twitter followers:\u0026nbsp“Is it me or is this geezer completely off his strange-looking nut?”One of his most famous tweets of all concerned events across the pond in 2012:\u0026nbsp“Can’t believe it’s nearly 11 years since them slags smashed into the Twin Towers. It still freaks my nut\u0026nbspout to this day.”As for the Queen, his rival for viewing figures on 25 December, Dyer is actually distantly related to her, as we learnt from a memorable 2016 instalment of the BBC’s Who Do You Think You Are?, which traced his East End roots back to the Tudor epoch and Edward III, a revelation he was stunned by.“I think I’m going to treat myself to a ruff… Just get a massive ruff, just bowl about with it and if anyone questions it then I’ll explain to them why I’m wearing a ruff,” he said, rather touchingly.\u0026nbspWishing the Queen a happy 90th birthday on an episode of ITV’s Celebrity Juice, he said: “You probably ain’t got a clue who I am… Go out tonight and get off your fucking nut. Enjoy yourself!”The author of The World According to Danny Dyer (2015) has done some of his very best work on social media, routinely dishing out deathless wisdom in his signature style: “I hate that early bird. You know, the one who catches the worm. Get back in ya nest ya feathery little mug.”On Christmas, he posted in 2013:\u0026nbsp“Just whacked me tree up. It’s looking slightly camp this year.\u0026nbspCan’t work out how to give it a pair of bollocks.”On pubs:\u0026nbsp”You’re going in for a drink and a laugh with your mates.

At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair. Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic\u0027s impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too.

He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off – namely Emma Thompson’s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman.There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don’t expose it to the light, don’t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act “like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company”, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked.Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK – it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since – it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone’s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining. But it’s also warm, funny, timeless, life-affirming, and a deserved classic.When Tim Allen’s Scott Calvin accidentally kills Santa Claus (a nice, light-hearted beginning to a family film) he is expected to take his place. He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future.

And thus did Charles Dickens become the man who invented Christmas as we know it today.\u0026nbspThe great Dickens scholar FG\u0026nbspKitton said so in an essay in 1903, and the great Downton Abbey actor Dan Stevens proved it to be true by starring in the 2017 film The Man Who Invented Christmas.Charles Dickens: The man who invented Christmas plagiarised JesusAnd yet, bah, humbug and damn those pesky experts: lots of them disagree.\u0026nbspIndeed, no less an authority than the US university-based Dickens Project now advises: “It is the smart thing to say that Dickens was the man who “invented” Christmas. Show you are smarter by disputing it.” A Christmas Carol\u0026nbspcomplete with John Leech\u0027s illustration of Mr Fezziwig\u0027s ball\u0026nbspIt is true that industrialisation meant fewer people were exposed to the rural squirearchy’s habit of opening their doors to the lower orders and staging grand Christmas celebrations – of the kind seen at Crewe Hall in Cheshire, where Dickens’ grandfather had been the butler, or in the pages of A Christmas Carol, where The Ghost of Christmas Past reminds Scrooge of how much he had enjoyed the dances organised by old Fezziwig.But in 1843, outside the ranks of the aristocracy and aspirant upper middle-class imitators, Christmas was alive and well.\u0026nbspPrevious attempts to kill it had, after all, foundered on the stubborn resistance of “Merrie England”.Puritan MPs may have ordered December 25 to be kept as a fast day in 1644, to avoid giving “liberty to carnal and sensual delights”.\u0026nbspAnd Oliver Cromwell may be famous as the man who banned Christmas.\u0026nbspBut the “rude multitude” broke the head of the major who tried to enforce the “Ordinance for abolishing holy-days” in Canterbury in 1647, and by 1656 MPs meeting in parliament, on Christmas Day, were reduced to wailing: “The people keep up these superstitious observances to your face … We are returning to Popery.”Created with Sketch.15 Christmas films to watch on Netflix  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Christmas Chronicles, a holiday adventure from producer Chris Columbus (“Home Alone”, Harry Potter) and director Clay Kaytis (The Angry Birds Movie), tells the story of sister and brother, Kate (Darby Camp) and Teddy Pierce (Judah Lewis), whose Christmas Eve plan to catch Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) on camera turns into an unexpected journey that most kids could only dream about.

After A Christmas Carol, people become obsessed with celebrating Christmas.“Before, there were people who were, like Scrooge’s nephew, doing their own family Christmases, but after, suddenly everyone is thinking: ‘We should be doing that.\u0026nbspWhy haven’t we got people coming round and playing blind man’s buff?’“It all starts to get much bigger.”Newspapers began to notice the establishment of “plum pudding clubs” to help less well-heeled Victorians meet the cost of their Christmas dinner, so they too, like the Cratchit family, could hear “the pudding singing in the copper”.\u0026nbspOther clubs helped them buy a goose, maybe even a “prize turkey” as big as the boy asked to fetch it by the reformed Scrooge.And, says Ms Hawksley, fewer employers wanted to look like the unreformed Scrooge: “It became fashionable for people to expect that they could have time off at Christmas.”Nor did Dickens stop at A Christmas Carol.\u0026nbspHe wrote four more Christmas books.\u0026nbspThen in 1850 he brought out the first “Christmas Number” of his newly created magazine Household Words, working with other writers to pack it with stories for the consumption of “the teeming millions”, as Reverend JH\u0026nbspMorgan called the intended readership of the two-penny weekly.He became, as the Morning Chronicle put it, “the chief literary master of the ceremonies for Christmas”.But, Ms Hawksley\u0026nbspemphasises, when he started it all with A Christmas Carol, Dickens had been seeking to do far more than simply become a sidekick to Father Christmas.\u0026nbsp“It was done as a protest,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “Christmas Carol was written from the heart, from Dickens feeling a desperate need to create change.”Gustave ​​Doré (Alamy)These were the “hungry Forties”, a decade when Britain was in the grip of economic depression, when harvests failed and food prices were rising beyond the reach of many on low incomes.\u0026nbspIn May 1843 Dickens had railed against the wealthy attendees of a City of London charity dinner, calling them “sleek, slobbering, bow-paunched, overfed, apoplectic, snorting cattle”.\u0026nbspThey offered a stark contrast to the poverty he was encountering with ever greater frequency on his customary long walks through London.Then in October Dickens was invited to give a fundraising speech at the Athenaeum in Manchester.\u0026nbspThis was the same Manchester where Friedrich Engels was beavering away at what would be published as The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844.\u0026nbspEngels sought to shame the Victorian manufacturing class by documenting the “the misery and grime which form the complement of their wealth”.\u0026nbspHe told of workers living in overcrowded slums complete with “foul pools of stagnant urine and excrement”, forced by “barbarous” employers to “work 30 to 40 hours at a stretch”, with child factory hands dying or being reduced to “a crowd of cripples” before they could reach adulthood.\u0026nbspHe wrote A Christmas Carol in just six weeks.\u0026nbsp“He saw galloping poverty,” explains Ms Hawksley, “And a government doing nothing about it.\u0026nbspHe couldn’t let it continue.\u0026nbspHe was desperate to do something.”Into the mouth of Scrooge, Dickens inserted what, in his Manchester speech, he had called the “cruel absurdities” of the age.\u0026nbspTo the charitable gentleman seeking alms for the poor, Scrooge offers only a reference to the treadmill of the workhouse, which was about the only official social security option then available.When the gentleman suggests the poor would rather die than enter the workhouse, Scrooge answers: “If they would rather die, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”The remark comes to haunt Scrooge once the ghosts start arriving, but it wasn’t far off what many thought about the poor being an unconscionable drain on the finite resources of a population that could not keep expanding forever.\u0026nbspIn most of his books, Dickens wanted to shame his readers into doing something,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “What he wants people to realise is that every single person is, like Scrooge, responsible for the poor they are ignoring.“The point about Scrooge’s conversion is not that he buys the most expensive turkey.\u0026nbspIt’s that the turkey will feed a family.“For Dickens, it’s not about diamonds, or going out and buying a load of plastic crap like people do at Christmas today.\u0026nbspIt’s about the fact that buying decent food and giving Bob Cratchit a salary increase will save Tiny Tim from dying.”Nowhere, says Ms Hawksley, is the central message of A Christmas Carol more clearly stated than when the Ghost of Christmas Present shows Scrooge two emaciated children, a boy named Ignorance and a girl called Want.\u0026nbsp“Beware of them both,” the spirit tells Scrooge –\u0026nbspand the reader.\u0026nbsp “But most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased.”“Dickens was saying,” explains Ms Hawksley, “that if you let Ignorance and Want grow up like that, they will become the Bill Sykes, the cruel and violent adults, of the future.“Ignorance and Want are, in Dickens’ mind, about the most important characters in the book, the whole message, the whole point of it.”Alston: Poverty UK\u0027s \u0027biggest challenge\u0027 and\u0026nbspMPs are in \u0027state of denial\u0027 about itWhat frustrates her more, however, is that 175 years after Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol, Britain remains blighted by the kind of poverty he was hoping to eradicate.“Dickens was writing about this in 1843,” she says.\u0026nbsp“How in 2018 can we have the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty talking about child poverty in the UK?\u0026nbspHow can there be so many homeless people on the streets of London?“How can I be hearing news stories that Christmas 2018 will be a so-called “bumper year” for the numbers of children suffering in cold houses because people can’t afford to heat their homes?\u0026nbspThere is absolutely no excuse for it when today we have so much more in terms of money, housing and knowledge of sanitation.”How London is living a modern day Christmas CarolWhat does Christmas Carol still mean to us?In the 19th\u0026nbspcentury, after “crying his eyes out” over A Christmas Carol, the author Robert Louis Stevenson, wrote enviously: “Oh, what a jolly thing it is for a man to have written books like these and just filled people’s hearts with pity.”In the 21st century, Dickens\u0027 great-great-great granddaughter is grimly ambivalent about how the work continues to generate similar reactions.\u0026nbsp“Every year,” says Ms Hawksley, “I meet people who have read A Christmas Carol for the first time, who say, ‘I can’t believe how good it is, how it still resonates.’“That’s wonderful in terms of Dickens’ writing, but depressing in terms of society.\u0026nbspIt frustrates me that A Christmas Carol is still so deeply relevant.\u0026nbspIt bothers me that 175 years after Dickens was writing about the children Ignorance and Want, we still have so much child poverty.”“And that,” she says, “Is what would make Dickens spin in his grave.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to

You don’t know why. Something happens and your life is going to change.’ William Cook meets the artisan at her Hampstead homeClick to followThe IndependentThe French creative tried to fit her art around business for nearly 30 yearsIn Gainsborough’s House in Sudbury, where Britain’s greatest portrait artist was born and raised, there’s a bust of that great artist which captures his personality as well any painting. His expression is quizzical. There’s a\u0026nbsphint of mischief in his eyes. Seeing it for the first time you might suppose it was made 250 years ago – the result of numerous painstaking sittings. In fact, it was made just a few years ago, by the sculptor Nicole Farhi.Nicole Farhi, sculptor? Wait a minute – I thought she was a fashion designer? Well, yes and no. It’s true that she made her reputation with her chic yet comfy clothes, but although her name remains a byword for casual elegance she’s not involved in fashion anymore. Instead she’s making sculpture now, full-time, and in February she has a new show at Gainsborough’s House, in Suffolk, where her Gainsborough bust has pride of place.I know nothing about fashion, but I liked that Gainsborough bust a lot. It was conscientious and unpretentious. The focus was on the subject not the sculptor, the way such sculptures ought to be. So when my friend Tracy wangled me an invite to Farhi’s Hampstead home, I jumped at the chance to meet her. I wanted to find out if her new career as a sculptor was for real. I wanted to know if that Gainsborough bust was just a one-off.She meets me in the doorway of her Georgian house. You wouldn’t know she’s 72. Her huge mane of wavy hair is as thick and wild as ever. Her eyes are bright. Her skin is clear. She’s dressed simply, in white pumps, blue jeans and a blue jumper. On anyone else her age, these plain clothes would look dowdy. On her, they’re stylish. How does she pull it off? A pointless question, no need to ask. She’s a famous fashion designer, after all.She was also an interior designer – everything from furnishing to kitchenware – and so, as you’d expect, her home is pretty stylish too: lots of brightly coloured drapes lots of paintings on the walls lots of books and classy bric-a-brac, and lots of sculptures too. She shows me a bust she made of a friend, sculpted when he was in deep despair, a face misshapen with pain and grief. “He looked so torn – his wife had left him.”\u0026nbspIt’s a world away from her Gainsborough bust, so discreet and delicate by comparison. I never knew her work had such range. I’m pleasantly surprised. I’m also quite impressed.Controversial uterus sculptures by Damien Hirst unveiled in QatarOf course it’s terribly unfair, as I know all too well. My mother is a sculptor, about the same age as Nicole. She’s been slogging away throughout her life, ever since art school, and has never broken through. Yet no one’s life is easy. Nicole’s fame has opened doors, but those doors would soon close again if the work wasn’t any good. Britons distrust polymaths and are suspicious of second careers. It may be a bit easier for Nicole to get to first base with her sculpture. It may be a lot harder for her to get beyond second base.It’s not as if sculpture is a newfound fancy. She’s been hard at it for over half her life – 37 years. She shows me a small torso, the first sculpture she ever made. As she holds it in her hand she tells me how she came to make it. She’d gone to see the sculptor Jean Gibson, to ask if she could be her pupil. “I’ll only take you if you have something to say – otherwise, it’s a waste of time,”\u0026nbspsaid Jean as\u0026nbspshe handed Nicole a piece of clay. Jean told Nicole to sculpt a torso, there and then. When Nicole had finished, Jean took a good look at it. “I’m taking you on – come back on Wednesday,” she\u0026nbspsaid.Farhi also sculpts hands and torsos (Walter van Dyk)“I went to my car and I burst into tears – I was so emotional,”\u0026nbsprecalls Nicole. “You see a door opening to another world. I’m emotional just to think about it.”\u0026nbspAs she retells the story, her eyes well up with tears.It’s like falling in love. You don’t know why. Something happens and your life is going to changeNo, this is no passing fad. “It’s like falling in love. You don’t know why. Something happens and your life is going to change.”\u0026nbspFor over 30 years she had to fit her sculpture around fashion, but then in 2012, she walked away. “Now I sculpt every day.”She takes me to her studio, an orangery\u0026nbspin the garden. There are rows and rows of busts in here, of famous friends: Bill Nighy, Judi Dench, Anna Wintour, Wallace Shawn, Stephen Frears… these busts are full of character. She sculpts hands too, and the torsos of voluptuous women, some of which will be shown at the Beaux Arts London gallery in January. “Large women are beautiful – flesh is wonderful!”\u0026nbspshe exclaims.\u0026nbspThese Rubenesque women are a world away from the models she used to work with during her previous career. “It’s about the sensuality of the flesh, the beauty that large women have,”\u0026nbspshe says. “For me, it’s a complete antidote, obviously, to everything I did before, to work on larger bodies. But it’s also very important for me to show that you expect to see beauty in a slim person, when beauty is in everything and everybody.”The artist in her orangery-turned-studio (Julian Jans)Discovering sculpture later on in life has made her determined not to waste a moment. “I don’t have 50 years in front of me,”\u0026nbspshe says. “I work every single day, but I don’t mind. I’m so happy that I have been able to stop fashion and just sculpt.”\u0026nbspShe loved art from an early age, and used to paint while she was a student, but when she was young she preferred the whirlwind of the fashion world to the isolation of the artist, so she’s philosophical about the time she’s lost.“Maybe I would not have been serious enough as artist then,”\u0026nbspshe says. “Sculpture is a much slower pace. I can take it now. Probably at the age of 20 I could not.”\u0026nbspAfter 40 years in fashion, she relishes her new seclusion. “I don’t miss the world of fashion at all. I’m very happy on my own here.”For me, it’s a complete antidote, obviously, to everything I did before, to work on larger bodies. But it’s also very important for me to show that you expect to see beauty in a slim person, when beauty is in everything and everybodyShe was born in 1946 in Nice, the second of two children. Her parents were Sephardic Jews, immigrants from Turkey. There was no art in her childhood home. “None whatsoever.”\u0026nbspHer father was a gentle man who saw the best in everyone. He sold carpets for a living. “The house was full of rugs.”Her father sounds a bit too nice to be a terribly successful businessman, but she adored him all the same. “My mother always fought with him because she thought he was too kind,”\u0026nbspshe says, “but he was at peace with it – he was a wise man.”\u0026nbspHer relationship with her mother was more fiery, but her mother had more of an artistic sensibility than her father (“my dad never understood what I was doing”) and it was her mother who enabled her to go to Paris to study fashion – her father wanted her to stay at home.One of the reasons she chose to study fashion was because there were no fashion schools close to home. “Nice was a very small town,”\u0026nbspshe says. “I was dreaming of the capital.”\u0026nbspIn Paris, she soon made her mark, not by impressing her tutors but by cold-calling fashion houses, from public telephones in corner cafes, and asking to show them her drawings and designs. For an unknown teenager, that must have taken a lot of confidence, I say. “There was no other way,”\u0026nbspshe replies. “I didn’t think I had anything to lose.”It was in Paris, in 1972, that she met the founder of French Connection, the London fashion retailer Stephen Marks (“a fabulous businessman”). They started working together, became a couple, and had a child together – a daughter, Candice, now a photographic agent in America.‘Flesh is wonderful,’ Farhi says of her subjects (Walter van Dyk)For a few years, Nicole remained in Paris with Candice, but eventually, she decided it would be best for Candice to go to school in Britain, so when Candice was four she brought her to London.She’s lived here ever since, but she still feels French rather than British (she still speaks with a strong French accent) and the clothes that she designed brought a continental flair to British fashion. Yet she had no game plan, no grand design.She was simply doing what came naturally. “I only did what I felt was right for me. I designed looser clothes because that’s what I liked wearing. I didn’t do very short dresses, because I didn’t think that was nice, to look at a girl and only see the thighs – when she’s dressed, of course. When she’s naked it’s a different thing!”Created with Sketch.Nicole Farhi sculptures – in pictures  Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Principal Dancer, 2016Nicole Farhi in her studio working, 2016Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Homage to Eduardo Paolozzi, 2014Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Principal Dancer, 2016 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Principal Dancer, 2016Nicole Farhi in her studio working, 2016Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Homage to Eduardo Paolozzi, 2014Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Principal Dancer, 2016 What was it like working with the father of her only child? “It was good and bad because we argued a lot at work,”\u0026nbspshe says. “We were fighting a lot.”\u0026nbspIn the end, they separated, but they kept on working together. “And then things changed completely. We had the best relationship working together once we were not living together, and now we’re still very, very close friends. We had a lot of respect for each other, which we never lost. I think he helped me tremendously at becoming who I was.”\u0026nbspThey’re still close today.In 1992 Nicole married the playwright David Hare, with whom she shares this splendid house. It sounds like love at first sight, and, from the way she talks about him, it sounds as if their love has never faded. Yet they might so easily have never met. Nicole had designed some costumes for Hare’s play, Murmuring Judges, and was invited to the first night party. Yet she had no intention of going until she saw Hare on TV the night before. “He went straight to my heart!”\u0026nbspshe says. Entranced and intrigued, she went to the party, and he made a beeline for her table. “It was the same for him!”The artist working on a bust of Bill Nighy, just one of her famous friends (Julian Jans)“You should have started earlier,”\u0026nbspHare said when he saw her sculptures. Maybe she should have met him earlier, too. When she was a fashion student in Paris, Hare was studying at the Sorbonne. They both used to skip classes to go to the movies, at the same cinemas, and yet their paths never crossed. “We could have been younger, had kids together,”\u0026nbspshe muses. Yet, as she says, quite rightly, there’s no point in crying over what you’ve missed.While Nicole sculpts in the orangery, David writes in his own studio just down the road. For two creative artists in their early 70s, it sounds like an idyllic life. “We don’t meet during the day – he doesn’t come home for lunch,” she says. But they’re obviously besotted with each other. Clearly, a little absence makes the heart grow fonder as the years ebb away.Artist uses robots to create stunning \u0027classical\u0027 sculptures16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)Controversial uterus sculptures by Damien Hirst unveiled in QatarFor the last seven years, they’ve shared the house with Nicole’s mother, who moved in with them at the grand old age of 95. For Nicole, it was a poignant epilogue to a long and turbulent relationship. “She did tell me, perhaps for the first time in her life, when she was 101, that she loved me,”\u0026nbspshe says. “Because we fought so much, I was never sure.”\u0026nbspShe died six months ago, aged 102. Nicole shows me the bust she made of her, looking feisty and defiant, but the sculpture that really moves me is of her frail little hand, cast when she was 100.Stephen Marks sold the Nicole Farhi label in 2010. Nicole carried on working there, but it was never quite the same. She left a couple of years later. “I hoped one day I would stop, but I had no idea when that would be. It was only when my company was sold that I realised that was my way out.”\u0026nbspFor her, it was a liberation. When Nicole Farhi went into administration the following year she felt oddly detached from the brand that still bears her name. “It was not upsetting at all,”\u0026nbspshe says. “I could not wait to leave.”No matter. Sculpture is what she does now, and she’s determined not to look back. As she shows me out, she stops to show me the bust of her friend and mentor, the great Italian-Scottish sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi. “He opened my eyes to everything,”\u0026nbspshe tells me, as we say goodbye. It’s a supremely expressive sculpture, full of life and love and suffering. There are several others I like a lot, but for me, this is the pick of the bunch. Before I met her, I couldn’t quite understand why she’d turned her back on fashion, but now I know she was right to do so. Nicole Farhi used to be a brilliant fashion designer, but that was then and this is now. She’s a proper sculptor now.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

There are a variety of options, but all have serious problems and would be unlikely to keep everyone happy.Here are the main possibilities – and what’s wrong with them all.The most obvious option is to rerun the 2016 EU referendum question and simply ask people whether they want to remain in the European Union or leave it.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut this question repeats the same mistakes as the last vote: what does “leave” actually mean? The government is currently in deadlock and the referendum is supposed to let the people decide,\u0026nbspbut this question simply doesn’t solve the problem the government is facing. If Leave wins again, we’re back to square one. As a result, it’s unlikely to be asked.\u0026nbspRemain vs Theresa May’s deal vs no dealSplitting out no deal and May’s deal seems to be a logical response to the problems with the last question. Voters would be able to choose between any of the three options.But this would split the Leave vote, leaving Remain to almost certainly win. Most unsustainably, it could even produce a Remain win when the majority of people actually vote for Leave options. Democratically, this is a non-starter\u0026nbspand would reasonably be seen as a stitch-up.‘Do you approve of the Brexit deal negotiated by the government?’The government could simply ask voters to approve or reject the Brexit deal. This suffers from similar problems as the first question: if the deal is rejected, what happens? Do we leave with no deal? Or remain?\u0026nbspIt might prove attractive as a roll of the dice for a government trying to ram through the deal without its MPs – or then again it might not\u0026nbspbecause the public would probably vote it down, according to current polls. This also has no ‘remain’ option so would surely disappoint the main people who want a second referendum – remain voters.One proposal is to ask the questions in two rounds: first, whether voters accept or reject the deal. Then, if it’s rejected, whether they want to remain or leave without a deal.\u0026nbspYou could also ask the questions in a different order if you wanted – leave vs remain first, and then pick between no deal and Therea May’s deal if it’s a Leave vote. But whatever order you ask the questions in, there is a fundamental issue here.Is it really a good idea to put no deal on the ballot paper, and risk giving the government an explicit binding mandate to create food and medicine shortages?\u0026nbspCurrently, parliament can stop a no deal and credibly claim it isn’t what people voted for. But holding this referendum puts economic catastrophe back on the table and could make the situation infinitely worse – which raises the question of why you would want to hold it at all.\u0026nbspPolling suggests that no deal is more popular than May’s deal – it is not impossible that it could win, given voters chose Leave last time.\u0026nbspThis no-deal problem\u0026nbspis a thread that runs through many second referendum options. Explicitly putting it on the ballot paper is probably not a good idea. But not putting it on the ballot paper doesn’t solve the problem.You could ask the three-way question and give\u0026nbspvoters the options of\u0026nbspranking the options, then tally them up using\u0026nbspan alternative vote\u0026nbsp(AV). This is practically the same as two-round voting and has the same problem – no deal is on the ballot.There are also extra problems, such as the fact that AV can produce some quite unintuitive results – and the fact that the system was explicitly rejected for parliamentary elections at a referendum in 2011, so its use would certainly be contested.This is the option favoured by the People’s Vote campaign. In some ways it is the least worst: it rules out no deal. Remainers will like it because it offers them the option of staying. It is also explicit about what each option means, so it solves the deadlock.But it runs the risk of being seen as illegitimate: the fact remains that a not insignificant number of people are actively campaigning for leaving on World Trade Organisation terms without a deal. Many Brexiteers say they see Theresa May’s deal as “no Brexit at all”. They would consider this question a betrayal – forced to choose between two things they don’t want, despite having won the first vote.There is also the question of political deliverability. The country has a Tory government, and if there are two things that the vast majority of Tory MPs don’t want to vote for, they are: Remain, and Theresa May’s deal. So why would they pass a referendum that forces them to choose between two options they hate?Any question with ‘negotiate a different deal’ or ‘Norway’ as an optionThe EU has said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, so putting it as an option in a referendum would be meaningless. If it was voted for the government would be stuck.Similarly, suggestions that a soft Brexit like the Norway option\u0026nbsp(entry into the European Economic Area) or similar could be on the ballot papers misunderstand the situation. The government needs to pass the withdrawal agreement before April or extend or revoke Article 50. Having a referendum on the future relationship is fine, but it wouldn’t solve the problem\u0026nbspand isn’t an alternative to working out what to do with the withdrawal agreement.So in summary…You either risk causing an economic catastrophe by putting no deal on the ballot paper, you exclude no deal as an option and risk the referendum being seen as illegitimate by the people who won last time, or you don’t solve the actual dilemma the government is currently facing.\u0026nbspThat isn’t to take away from the compelling case for a Final Say referendum, which The Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for at length\u0026nbspand collected more than a million signatures in favour of. Done right, another vote\u0026nbspcould solve the UK’s political deadlock, check whether the public still want to leave, and spell out what’s really on offer. But if one is called, the question will have to be chosen carefully, with an awareness of the tradeoffs.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them.

Looks shocking on the film, unacceptable in any environment.”However, shortly after prime minister’s questions, Mr Corbyn’s spokesman denied the allegation, insisting: “He did not call her a ‘stupid woman’. So I don’t think there is a basis for an apology. As I understand it he said ‘stupid people’.”The spokesman told reporters: “Lip reading in such circumstances is always open to doubt.”As tempers flared, John Bercow, the Commons speaker, said he did not see or hear the alleged remark, but made clear: “Is that language unacceptable? Yes.”He also urged Mr Corbyn “to return to the chamber” to hear his verdict on what happened later this afternoon, after watching the TV footage.Corbyn\u0027s barely there leadership could lead to mutiny – againLabour \u0027would fall behind Lib Dems\u0027 if Corbyn backs May\u0027s Brexit dealJeremy Corbyn accuses May of presiding over \u0027government in chaos\u0027In a BBC TV studio, Barry Gardiner, a Labour frontbencher and Corbyn ally, said he was “not a lipreader” but agreed it appeared that Mr Corbyn had said “stupid woman”.The row blew up after Ms May likened Mr Corbyn’s attempt to force a confidence vote in her earlier this week to a Christmas pantomime – accusing him of dithering.First he said he would call a no confidence vote, Then he said he wouldn’t. Then he did, but it was not effective. “Oh yes he will, oh no he won’t,” she taunted – saying the Labour leader should “look behind him” at his own despairing MPs.But Mr Corbyn hit back, saying it was the prime minister’s job to deliver the negotiation and, if she was incapable of doing so, she should step aside for someone who can.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereVote of no confidenceOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

And some reality TV stars set a good example, just as some of our more traditional public figures leave a lot to be desired.It seemed to me that Love Island winners Jack and Dani were quite a moral couple. They acted with integrity, which is a really good message for young people.But contrast this with US President Donald Trump — I’ve spoken to girls in an assembly about lewd com-ments he has made and how they fit with his role of Leader of the Free World.More recently, we’ve seen Harry Redknapp triumph in I’m A Celebrity — and he came across as a loving, loyal man who represents an image of masculinity that sometimes we don’t see.So never mind politicians,you want to present an argument for decency, sometimes you’re better off getting a healthy dose of reality TV.THE incoming head of the Girls’ Schools Association, Sue Hincks, says reality TV stars are better role models for schoolchildren than politicians.Is she right  As evidence she offered ’s Love Island and I’m A Celebrity.It’s true that this year’s winners — Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham in Love Island, and Harry Redknapp in I’m A Celeb — were adorable.But it’s easy to look brave when you are wearing a helmet full of insects, especiallyyour background is in musical theatre, like campmate John Barrowman.I’d try to remember I was comparing reality TV stars to Donald Trump, who, though incidentally President of the United States and a politician, is still, and always will be, a reality TV star. He just has more cameras these days.But then I look at the current state of British politicians and it’s hard not to agree with Hincks.At least on reality TV the contestants try to disguise their moral failings, becausethey didn’t, no one would vote for them.This isn’t a problem for politicians, because on any given day the other side are behaving worse.I long for the calm wisdom of ’Arry and the open-hearted kindness of Dani — I’m sure she would be fine, with a strong Cabinet secretary behind her, telling her the dference between the deficit and the debt. Perhaps the new crop of “wholesome” reality TV stars is a response to our politicians, a cry of the heart from the electorate: “We just want someone kind!”Look at Boris Johnson, and his new haircut for the leadership contest that never came. What did he tell his barber  “Don’t make me look like a flatulent, floppy-haired former public schoolboy” When did anyone last call BJ kind Or at David Davis, who pitched for the Tory leadership in  with the catchphrase “It’s DD for me”. That’s not a campaign slogan, it’s a bra cup size.Look at the younger Tories, seething with ambition, bungee jumping over the corpses of rivals with lattes in their hands.The horrible irony is, they would bite their own fingers off for a chance to appear on Strictly Come Dancing.On the other side we have a Labour leadership juddering with cowardice, longing for a hard Brexit — while lying about it — and a swt General Election, like the bourgeois Trots they are. If it’s bad for the people, it’s good for them. Yuk.So Hincks isn’t wrong to make a comparison which even five years ago would have seemed obscene.Can it be that reality TV stars are the best of us, and reality TV is now more authentic than actual real le If true — and it seems to be — things are bad indeed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Such a move, he added, would help those most at risk from a No Deal Brexit “to boost them as they transition”.We’re told in a doomsday No Deal ­scenario that all planes will be grounded and the country will be sold no medicines from abroad.It’s even claimed that our food exports will rot in lorries queued up at Dover, while we starve because no food is being imported via Calais, both of which seem unlikely to happen at the same time.To listen to some campaigners, you’d think there are only three kinds of ­relationship with the EU: Membership, paying the massive bills and swallowing endless laws from Brussels a big, one-size-fits-all deal or a smouldering ruin, cut off completely from trade or co-operation.It might be in their interests to pretend so, because they want to try to frighten us into accepting a poor deal or scare us into abandoning the idea of taking back control altogether. But it isn’t true.Most of the world aren’t EU members, after all, and many countries don’t have trade deals with the EU.Brussels’ rule-by-committee means that trade negotiations with the bloc are slow and have to satisfy a dizzying list of ­special interests.Of the deals that countries have struck with the EU,  dferent types have been hammered out.Anyone who claims there is no flexibility in how we manage our relationship after Brexit is not telling the whole story.But even beyond that, among the many countries who trade with the EU without a deal, the reality does not match up to the black-and-white claim that the choice is either full deal or No Deal.In real le, most countries are quite practical and have the power to reach a whole range of smaller agreements with one another that fall short of a trade deal but still bring benefits.They recognise each other’s driving licences or doctors’ qualications, allow mutual access to their air space, or agree to trust each other’s safety tests on goods rather than hold them up for costly extra testing at their ports.Why do they do it  Because it is in both sides’ interests for trade, tourism and le in general to flow as easily as possible.The US does it, the EU does it, every normal state does it — and there’s no ­reason why we and the EU couldn’t do it, too,it isn’t possible to reach a larger agreement for le after Brexit right now.As Theresa May is finding out, some issues might simply be too dficult or controversial for the UK or the EU to give ground on in the next few weeks.But that should not stop us from ­shaking hands on hundreds of other side deals that both sides could agree quite simply, and which would help both sides to square away.That’s what’s called a “managed no deal” — it might not be either our or their dream outcome but it would make le easier while work continues on overcoming the really dficult sticking points.What’s shocking is the way in which this practical approach has been widely ignored for political reasons.Some of the much-touted “worst-case scenario” forecasts for the supposed cost of Brexit rely on the ridiculous assumption that Brussels and Westminster would do literally nothing to reduce any potential problems from No Deal.We’ve been told repeatedly from some quarters that it is simply impossible for the EU to show any flexibility at all with a non-member, even though it has done so in ious cases.At long last, that lie is being exposed. Just as the UK has released its No Deal preparations, the EU is this week ­publishing details of how it would ­handle that situation.And guess what  Brussels wants to strike mutual side deals in which we both agree to respect ious aspects of each other’s rights in order to limit ­disruption and costs.It turns out there is a practical way ­forward after all, and the doom-mongers’ predictions should be taken with a hefty fistful of salt.Of course a good, wide-ranging, lasting deal is still desirable, and we should keep working to agree one.But there are things we can and should do in the meantime.Better that than be rushed into a ­permanent bad deal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It would seem they agree about nothing. As soon as one minister says something another clown will jump up and insist he’s wrong.It’s like being led by a bunch of hyperactive five-year-olds. If it wasn’t for the fact that the leader of the opposition is a cross between Catweazel and Trotsky we’d have got rid of them long ago.This time the argument is about immigration. The Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, has said there are no targets for reducing immigration. The PM immediately responded: “Oh yes there are, baldie.”For once, Theresa May is right. Immigration is a crucial issue and we have been promised time and again — by May herself — that it will be drastically reduced. That’s what the vast majority of the country wants. And the only sensible way to do it is by having targets. You know, something to aim at.We’ve put up with a lot from this Government, maybe too much. If they start backsliding on immigration, that will be it. Down to tens of thousands of people per year, please, as soon as possible. Uncontrolled immigration has made this country almost unrecognisable.We still need to import some talent from overseas. People with good skills and high qualications. What we don’t need are thousands of beggars shoving badly scrawled messages in your face saying “Money Give Now” on the Tube.Nor do we need the thousand upon thousand of unskilled workers picking fruit and veg. Here’s a tip, farmers — pay a decent wage and maybe a few British people will give those jobs a go, huh British businesses have exploited cheap foreign labour for far too long. And the result is an underclass of Eastern Europeans living in desperately squalid conditions, in appalling accommodation.It’s not THEIR fault, by any means. It’s the fault of an immoral system which has seen the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.Cheap EU labour has meant that the wages of the very poorest Britons get undercut. Why on earth the Labour Party supports this exploitation is a total mystery to me.But the other real problem we have is immigration from outside the EU. This easily outnumbers those coming from Europe. I don’t just mean those who say they are refugees but are clearly economic migrants. Although Theresa May could do worse than pledge a halt to that influx, which continues.But we still let in thousands of people from all over the world. They come claiming their brother or cousin lives here and that should give them a right to our benefits and jobs.This has been going on for too long. And it is this immigration which has most changed the face of Britain, in a way many people resent.Here’s the deal, Theresa. Look at Belgium, where the government has just fallen because it ignored the country’s wishes on immigration. So get tough. Put Mr Javid back in his box and set a few realistic targets. Then get to grips with immigration full stop. And maybe we’ll all like you a bit more for it.SOME lesbians are furious.On Coronation Street, the lesbian character Kate Connor tried to seduce . . . a bloke.And the scene got a lot of lesbians up and down the country seething with rage.

Yet all too often, their needs are ignored.My own family started as blacksmiths in Uttoxeter, Staffs.In , my father, Joseph Cyril Bamford, rented a lock-up garage for  shillings a week.He developed Europe’s first hydraulic tipping trailer for use by local farmers — and then, in , the backhoe loader, the classic JCB digger.JCB — JC Bamford Excavators Ltd — has produced more than a million machines.We have a turnover of more than £billion and factories around the world.Yet we remain a proud ­family business, headquartered in the Midlands and employing thousands of people there.Ours is not a unique success story. Yet it is rarer than it should be.Our main factory in Staffs used to be surrounded by thriving family manufacturers, mostly in the Black Country, Birmingham and Manchester.Over the decades, they have disappeared — because of tax regimes that made it impossible to pass firms on, or takeovers that stripped away what was special about the company, or government mandarins who thought they knew better what industry needed.In Germany, their world-class manufacturing sector thrives because they champion family firms, not least via tax breaks that make it normal for ownership to move across generations.In Britain, the tax system pushes entrepreneurs to sell up, and family businesses find it harder to get finance.No wonder that fewer than  per cent expect to keep their firm in the family.Yet we at JCB still have many excellent family firms among our suppliers — and our customers.In manufacturing, there are more than a quarter of a million family companies, employing more than a million people in jobs that add real value to the community.And such firms are found in every sector of the economy, not just ours.A company such as JCB is big enough to stand up for, and speak for, itself.But too many small firms do not get a hearing in government.Despite the fact that small and medium-sized enterprises — SMEs — are creating almost three times as many jobs as larger firms, it is the voice of the giants that dominates.Yes, these large firms contribute enormously to the economy, but they tend to be the most comfortable with the status quo.They might moan about regulation but they can afford to deal with it, knowing that it deters their smaller competitors.They see Brexit, for example, in terms of costs, rather than opportunities. This is reflected in government.Theresa May’s approach to Brexit was safety-first, focusing on protecting the cross-border supply chains of the multi-nationals.Yet  per cent of British firms do not export. Their main worries are to do with competition and regulation.But regulation, in particular, is harder to addresswe are still following European rules — as is striking new trade deals.Protecting the big companies means reducing opportunities for little ones.I voted, proudly and publicly, for Leave.I believe there is nothing to fear in trading on World Trade Organisation terms, as we at JCB already do — exporting to, and importing from, dozens of countries around the world.But this is not about Brexit. Millions of business owners throughout the country feel they are not represented or spoken for.Polling by Deltapoll recently found that even Tory voters do not think their party is on the side of small business.For the politicians who listen to these firms, the rewards will be political as well as economic.I have spent my le working in a family business.I believe family businesses, of all sizes, are tied to and invested in their communities in a way other firms can never be.And I worry that Britain has a model of tax, regulation and politics in which everything is arranged to suit the big firms on the FTSE, not those that might one day hope to replace them.Whatever the outcome of the Brexit wrangling, we can only succeed long termwe make Britain the best place in the world to start, run and keep a business of your own.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

is this day marked, and what is the meaning behind it  Let’s take a closer look…The shortest day of  falls on December , today.It is known as the winter solstice, marking the day of the year with the fewest sunlight hours.The solstice always falls between December  and .Most years, it falls on the st in the UK, but sometimes it lands a little bit off-kilter, because it takes the Earth  and a quarter days to go around the sun.This extra quarter day is why we add a day to the calendar every four years with a leap year - to stop the dates drting gradually through the seasons.It is worth noting that December  is the Winter Solstice in the northern hemisphere – those south of the equator will be marking the Summer Solstice tonight.The word “solstice” comes from the Latin solstitium meaning “sun stands still”.It refers to the point when the apparent movement of the sun’s path seems to stop briefly.The event is one of the oldest winter celebrations, and it is still marked by a number of dferent cultures around the world.Winter solstice is an important time for cultures across the globe.Under the old Julian calendar, the winter solstice occurred on December .With the introduction of the Gregorian calendar the solstice slipped to the st, but the Christian celebration of Jesus’s birth continued to be held on  December.The day is primarily observed by Pagans and Druids who descend on Stonehenge to mark the occasion.Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument located in Wiltshire, which is carefully aligned on a sight-line that points to the winter solstice sunset.Archaeologists believe it was constructed from  BC to  BC and it is thought that the winter solstice was actually more important to the people who constructed Stonehenge than the Summer solstice.The winter solstice was historically a time when cattle was slaughteredand the majority of wine and beer was finally fermented.The only other megalithic monuments in the British Isles which clearly align with the sun are Newgrange in County Meath, Ireland and Maeshowe situated on Mainland, Orkney, Scotland.Both monuments famously face the winter solstice sunrise.While many associate December  with the solstice, in the pagan and druid communities the celebration comes the following day.These communities will dress in traditional costumes and mark the first sunrise after the astronomical event.This year, celebrations at Stonehenge fall on Saturday December , with the sun rising at :am.Celebrations of the lighter days to come have been common throughout history with feasts, festivals and holidays around the December solstice celebrated by cultures across the globe.The winter solstice festival Saturnalia began on December  and lasted for seven days in In Ancient Rome.These Saturnalian banquets were held from as far back as around  BCE to honor Saturn, the father of the gods.The holiday was celebrated with a sacrice at the Temple of Saturn, in the Roman Forum, and a public banquet, followed by private gt-giving, continual partying, and a carnival atmosphere that overturned Roman social norms.The festival was characterised as a free-for-all when all discipline and orderly behaviour was ignored.Wars were interrupted or postponed, gambling was permitted, slaves were served by their masters and all grudges and quarrels were forgotten.It was traditional to offer gts of imitation fruit , dolls , and candles .The Saturnalia would degenerate into a week-long orgy of debauchery and crime – giving rise to the modern use of the term saturnalia, meaning a period of unrestrained license and revelry.Saturnalia would degenerate into a week-long orgy of debauchery and crime and gave rise to the modern use of the term saturnalia, which means a period of unrestrained license and revelry.The Feast of Juulwas a pre-Christianfestival observed in Scandinavia at the time of the December solstice.People would light fires to symbolise the heat and light of the ing sun and a Juullog was brought in and dropped in the hearth as a tribute the Norse god Thor.The Yule Log was often an entire tree that was carefully chosen and brought into the house with great ceremony.The largest end of the log would be placed into the fire hearth, while the rest of the tree stuck out into the room.The log was burned until nothing but ash remained, and this was collected and either strewn on the fields as fertiliser every night until Twelfth Night or kept as a charm and or as medicine.A piece of the log was kept as both a token of good luck and as kindling for the following year’s log.Yalda or Shab-e Chellehis an Iranian festival celebrated on the longest and darkest night of the year”.Every year, on December , Iranians celebrate the arrival of winter, the renewal of the sun and the victory of light over darkness.Pomegranate, watermelon and dried nuts are served as a tradition and classic poetry and old mythologies are read in a family gathering, led by an elder member of the household.It is believed that eating watermelons on the night of Chelleh will ensure the health and well-being of the inidual during the months of summer by protecting him from falling victim to excessive heat or disease.December  is observed as St Thomass Day in the Christian calendar.In Guatemala, this day sees Mayan Indians indulge in the ritual known as the Palo Volador, or “flying pole dance”.Three men climb on top of a -foot pole as one of them beats a drum and plays a flute.The other two men wind a rope attached to the pole around one foot and jump.If they land on their feet, it is believed that the sun god will be pleased and that the days will start getting longer.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

not to hide from it or deny it but to acknowledge and accept it.As Kevin Barry says in the piece like all deluded romantics, I find winter to be the sweetest time, and here at its heart, on the shortest day of the year, as we wait for the great wheel to turn, I think its right to feel wistful for its imminent passing.It was that article believe it or not that inspired me and also the belief that while its great to celebrate the summer and the light, we should acknowledge the darkness and give it a seat by the fire too, and that feels like the right thing to do at this time of year, especially on a small island on the north of Europe."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0004083005572.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"loch ness sighting webcam","story":"Sightings of the Loch Ness Monster have reached another record for this century after a woman claims to have spotted Nessie over the internet.Business consultant Caroline Barnett, , from Farmborough, near Bath, was watching the Loch Ness Webcam at .am on Wednesday when she saw something move slowly up the loch.She said: It popped up and down - and kept doing it. It kept splashing about.It was quite a size - the size of a boat but it was hard to tell because it was the other side of the loch.I didnt knowI believed in Nessie but this is certainly some Christmas present and quite a surprise.The sighting - the th this year - comes just six days after another spotter saw a mysterious creature with a ft neck and a head the size of a rugby ball.Ricky Phillips, a British military historian said he was baffled by the sight.Mr Phillips, , also works as a tour guide and was leading a party of eight foreign tourists who went on a cruise on Loch Ness.It was as he rested at the River Oich, just as it flows into Loch Ness at Fort Augustus, that Mr Phillips saw the strange sight at .pm.It was a grey creature - almost bird like - in a grey stretch of water. Its neck was three to four feet long, a head the size of a rugby ball and a ridge across its eyes, said Mr Phillips.The previous Wednesday I had heard a strange noise as I was stood by a cafe at the edge of the loch in Fort Augustus. The noise sounded almost metallic, but like something was blowing air - like Darth Vader.I have swum and sailed with whales and dolphins, seen hundreds of seals, and it sounded like nothing I have ever heard. I spun around and saw something grey, just a side of a body and a flipper.Mr Phillips is adamant it was his second sighting of the fabled beast.He continued: Last Thursday after my tour party went on their cruise I decided to take a walk along the river Oich, mainly to see the old bridge, and was taking a few pictures of the loch and the scenery when I again heard that curious noise.I looked up from my phone and saw a long, straight neck, all completely grey, and a narrow face, which was only about ft away and then it turned and disappeared all in a few seconds.I looked down and realised that it was in my picture, so zoomed in and there it was. It actually looks like a giant bird or a peacock in the face, with high ridges above its eyes and what almost looks like a beak.I know dinosaurs came from birds and that many had hard lips, almost like a beak - but this is simply what I saw. It seems to have almost a frill on its neck. It is very odd.All I will say is that,I was going to fake a Nessie, I would certainly have made it look less like a bird and more like... well, more like what we think Nessie looks like!Irish missionary St Columba is first said to have encountered a beast in the River Ness in AD.Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in  by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson.The image was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0004576673081.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"morocco beheading suspect home","story":"It comes as another nine suspects were detained in the gruesome killings which took place in the early hours of Monday, bringing the total numbers of arrests to .The arrests took place in the capital Marrakesh, Essaouira, Sidi Bennour, Tangier and Ait Baha.In the raids cops seized an unlicensed hunting rle, binoculars, torches, a telescope, military vests and materials for manufacturing a bomb.The events seem to confirm fears the attack was planned by a wider Isis network operating across the country, which hasnt seen a terror attack on westerners since .Meanwhile pictures have revealed the squalid house of one of the terror suspects accused of the Scandinavian womens murders.Photos show the rundown home of Younes Ouaziad, one of four held over the killings of Dane Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, , and Norwegian Maren Ueland, , in the Atlas Mountains.Family of the suspect say the -year-old, who lived in dire conditions at his fathers house in Marrakesh, had repeatedly refused to get a job - even after his we had a miscarriage.The hunting obsessed Ouaziad became intensely jealous of his we after he turned to religion, his spouse said, forbidding her from leaving the house alone.Illiterate and unemployed Ouaziad became brainwashed by ISIS, his brother said.Arrested on a bus with three others yesterday, father-of-one Ouaziad lived at the property along with his we, daughter, sister and baby.Speaking at their home, his family and friends expressed their shock, painting a picture of a devoted family man chronically workshy and vulnerable to radicalisation.His father said: On Sunday night, police came to my house to investigate.

above all  is a sign that the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party are prepared to back her Brexit deal.“Without the DUP, they haven’t got a chance of passing it,” warns one Cabinet minister.What, then, do the DUP need to come on board One Secretary of State who has kept open lines of communication with them, tells me that “by grim necessity, they will need something more than cosmetic concessions to vote for the deal”.This minister explains that “the DUP want a bankable reassurance that the backstop won’t be permanent and that there won’t be progressive ergence between Great Britain and Northern Ireland”.The good news for Theresa May is that, according to one of those intimately involved in the negotiations, “the DUP want to sort things out”.“Relations between the leadership and the DUP had been in the deep freeze, they are somewhat better,” one Cabinet minister tells me.Adding that “the carelessness with which some of the principals have been treated has been repaired”.But the bad news for Theresa May is that the changes they want are signicant — and the EU aren’t going to offer them up straight away.The only way to get these changes might be to have Parliament vote for them and tell the EU that this is how the deal can get through and seethey are prepared to cooperate, or whether they’ll crash the entire Brexit negotiation over these additions.But one senior Cabinet minister laments that “Number  is miles away from being in that position”.This Secretary of State is adamant that they are “going to have to move”.Intriguingly, I am told the Irish have, via diplomatic back channels, communicated that one of the reasons they wouldn’t give May what she wanted at last week’s European Council was that they weren’t certain that what she was asking for would satisfy the DUP.I understand that privately senior Irish figures have been making clear thatthey knew precisely what the DUP wanted, they could then engage with that.I am told the Government will devote the dog days between Christmas and New Year to exploring what the DUP will accept, and what the EU can give.Getting the DUP back on board is vital for May because without that there is no chance of reducing the Tory rebellion down to a manageable size.The Tory machine is having a bit of success in whittling down the numbers against May’s deal.One hardcore Brexiteer admits that some backbench rebels “will go a bit soft”.But this sht is not yet anywhere near big enough to save May’s deal.Some in Cabinet are pinning their hopes on “people coming back after Christmas more pragmatic and less militant”.But one of those who has been trying to reduce the rebellion wearily remarks, “I don’t see much evidence of that.”The person who in Parliament, perhaps, knows the Tory Party best tells me that the equation is this: “If they get a legally binding codicil on the backstop, they’ll get it through.If they don’t, they won’t.”Over to you, Mrs May.A TORY MP is already telling colleagues that he has submitted his letter calling for a no-confidence vote in Theresa May next December.It is another reminder that the leadership issue isn’t going to go away.One loyalist Cabinet minister argues thatMay makes it through Brexit, she should then announce the timetable for her departure at conference next year.Having said when she’s off would probably be enough to prevent a confidence vote next December and allow her to leave with some dignity.May, though, is unlikely to bite on this idea.She is extremely resistant to boxing herself in on a departure date.The confidence vote has won May some time.But she won’t make next Decembershe interprets the result as a licence to carry on as before.One senior party figure is already complaining that she’s “not prepared to make the personnel changes that would help her own position”.While one figure inside the Government machine fumes that “the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing in Number  and that is causing havoc for the rest of us”.Meanwhile, ambitious Cabinet ministers are continuing to lay the ground for their leadership bids.But as one Secretary of State points out, “It is normally the manner and nature of the departure that determines the successor” which is one of the reasons why the coming Tory leadership race will be the most unpredictable contest in living memory.THE Tory rage at Jeremy Corbyn over his alleged “stupid woman” comment at Prime Minister’s Questions was fuelled by a sense that the Speaker John Bercow is biased against them.As Anna Soubry, who is normally infuriating her fellow Tories by calling for a second referendum, pointed out: If it had been a Tory man who had apparently said it about a Labour woman, Bercow would have been all over it.In recent months, senior Labour figures have openly admitted that they are prepared to turn a blind eye to the allegations of bullying against Bercow because they think he’ll help them on Brexit.This is an untenable position – it is like a team keeping a referee on the pitch because they think he’ll give them a penalty in injury time.As Wednesday showed, we are dangerously close to the Tory side of the chamber simply not accepting Bercow’s authority.One senior Tory backbencher, who has defended the Speaker in the past, tells me “it felt like an insurrection”.The tragedy of Bercow’s speakership is that once gone, the chair’s reputation for impartiality will be almost impossible to restore.MPs will never again trust in the neutrality of the Speaker as they once did.THERESA MAY is planning a New Year charm offensive as she tries to persuade Tory MPs to back her Brexit deal.All of them – and their spouses – have been invited to a party in Downing Street in the week of January , which is when the Commons debate on her deal resumes.The implicit message is clear: If the Government falls over Brexit and the Tories tear themselves apart over the issue, then there won’t be any more invites to Number  for you and your partner for a very long time.Whether this is enough to win round any wavering Tory MPs remains to be seen.It is going to take more than a few drinks to make the hardcore Brexiteers swallow their objections to the backstop.EvenTheresa May can win the big vote on her Brexit deal, she won’t be home and dry.Once the vote is won, the withdrawal agreement will have to be turned into law.This will provide plenty of opportunities for guerrilla warfare in Parliament.Cabinet ministers are particularly worried that rebels might put down an amendment making the payment of the £billion orce bill conditional on progress in the trade talks.If that passed, the EU would say that the UK hasn’t ratied the agreement and so there was no deal.Our journalists strive

We have minds of our own, and we need to take responsibility for our own actions.The reappearance of naked prejudice on the terraces can’t be blamed on anyone other than the racists themselves — and the other fans who stay silent instead of calling out the racists.These people should be named and shamed. Social media could be put to good use by posting a rogues’ gallery on every  and the faces of the bigots should be prominent, so that their wives, mothers and children can see what they’ve done. Roll on #stampoutracism.But the mystery is why there is an upsurge in such incidents right now.I, for one, thought that with the determined efforts of the clubs, led by the Kick It Out campaign, such scenes would cease. But I should have known better. Back in the early Seventies I lived ten minutes from Stamford Bridge — but I never went to home games.When it became fashionable to throw darts at our own fans, a black face standing in the Shed was nothing less than a walking bullseye.By the mid-Nineties I hoped it would be OK to bring my seven-year-old daughter and her pals to a game.Surely, there could be no danger in seats below the directors’ boxes, away from the common herd It took  minutes for me to learn the truth as two men in front of us leapt up to abuse the Sheffield Wednesday midfielder Carlton Palmer, screaming “You lanky-legged black ****”.I tapped one on the shoulder. He looked around, saw my face, and immediately apologised profusely. But the damage was done.Three weeks later, I attended a dinner at the City of London’s most glittering venue, the Guildhall.Suddenly, I found myself confronted by a familiar face — one of the same two men who had sat in the stand in front of us.A true racist, yet here he was, suave, suited and booted, at the heart of the British establishment. So much for the idea that all racists are ignorant, lower-class idiots.So what’s happened It seems bizarre that the Premier League, dominated by foreign players, many of them black, should still suffer from prejudice.And with top teams regularly playing in Europe, plus a successful England team nearly half of whose members are black or mixed race it’s hard to see why fans should start throwing bananas on the pitch again.But the truth is that many of the factors that drove racism on the terraces have never gone away, and have never been challenged effectively. Yes, recent political arguments about the EU and about immigration have allowed some of the scumbags who the game thought it had chased away to resurface with renewed bravado.It’s also possible that the increase in the number of fans from Eastern Europe, where attitudes to ersity are decidedly less tolerant, may have had an effect.Perhaps some of the brilliant players from Europe who now grace the English game might put themselves in the front line of their re-education.Butthe game wants to stamp out racism for good it needs to take a long, hard look at itself.In the Premier League, around one in five players are black.The number of black owners and coaches is negligible. This is sending out the worst message imaginable.I welcome the advent of great players like N’Golo Kante, Romelu Lukaku, and Dele Alli. But this is a sport owned and run almost exclusively by white men, who buy and sell black men at will.Yes, of  course, the heaviest weight that the players have to lt is their own multimillion-pound pay packets, so I don’t seek sympathy for them.But basically, football looks like the th-century plantation economy of the American South.It’s time for the game to start taking steps to make sure that its owners, their boards of directors and their executive and coaching staff look more like modern Britain.Arsenal v BurnleyAFC Bournemouth v BrightonCha v Leicester CityHuddersfield Town v SouthamptonManchester City v Crystal PalaceNewcastle United v FulhamWest Ham United v WatfordCardf City v Manchester UnitedIf the people at the top of the game seem to think that it’s OK to treat black people like field slaves, why would they expect the fans to treat the players with respect I saw my first game — Arsenal vs Leicester City — at the old Highbury ground.My dad wanted me to see his hero, the great inside-left George Eastham, in action.He realised that I was too small to see over the parapet, so we took the biggest book we had in the house for me to stand on. I watched Eastham while standing on Uncle Tom’s Cabin, the bestselling anti-slavery novel that had touched off the American Civil War.Maybe every owner needs to be sent a copy of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s book to remind our contemporary plantation bosses that it’s time for them too to confront the bigotry written into the game’s soul.Football’s racism hasn’t gone away, and it never will until we all look at its evil full in the face.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Northern Irish MPs won’t accept the plan as it stands because it would put checks on some goods travelling between Britain and Northern Ireland.Sun columnist James Forsyth today reveals that the Downing Street party is designed to send a clear message to Tory MPs that failure to deliver a Brexit deal could see them booted out of power and that means “there won’t be any more invites to Number  for you and your partner for a very long time”.It came as the Justice Secretary said Mrs May is unlikely to pursue a no deal Brexither deal fails.David Gauke sparked fresh Tory infighting by saying he would be “very surprisedthe Prime Minister went down that route”.He also reiterated his threat to quitno deal became the Government’s number one Brexit policy – saying he would find it “very dficult” to stay in the Cabinet.And he exposed the extent of Cabinet infighting by saying there were “genuinely dferent approaches” within Mrs May’s top team over what Plan B should bethe Commons votes down her Brexit deal next month.He becomes the third Cabinet minister in as many days to publicly speculate on alternative plans to Mrs May’s Brexit deal.Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said a second referendum would be “plausible” while Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom became the second Cabinet minister to publicly back a “managed no deal”the Withdrawal Agreement isn’t backed by MPs.Mrs May has always insisted that no deal is “better than a bad deal”.Mr Gauke told BBC Radio ’s Political Thinking podcast: “I think making a conscious decision to proceed with no deal would not be the responsible course of action.”Askedhe could stay in Cabinetno deal became the policy the Government pursued, the Justice Secretary said: “I think it would be very dficult for me in those circumstances.

Aged  and living locally, in a soft Scottish accent she quietly expressed regret le had been made harsher than in her salad days so she wanted to help families less fortunate than her own. Manager John McCorry, who manages the venue Church of the Venerable Bede in the Tyneside city’s Benwell area. thanked the pensioner and coaxed out her address to send a formal letter of appreciation. The cheque, I noticed, was for pound. She asked me not to publish her name as she was doing only what was right and deserved no public recognition. “I was able to get a decent council house and a decent job and now I’ve got a decent pension,” she explained, “and I’ve wanted to come in here for weeks. It’s wrong what’s happening to people. They should be helped not hurt. Creating poverty is unforgivable.”   Earlier a pair of handsome brothers in trendy trainers and designer clothes, strolled into the foodbank sited in the Church of the Venerable Bede in the Tyneside city’s Benwell area. Builders Behzad and Behnam Emami,  and , began to sweep up. Four yeas ago they had been asylum seekers from Iran who started volunteering when banned from paid employment. They continued after the Home Office let them stay and find jobs. “When we are free we are coming just to help,” said bashful Behzad. “To help people is good.” Later in the city’s historic indoor Grainger Market, with its famous Marks  Spencer’s Penny Bazaar, an old man in shabby clothes also wanted to help. I could see a handful of coins as he meekly approached a unit the Foodbank operates with Newcastle United fans to collect “Toonaid” donations from a Geordie nation doing what a Conservative Government isn’t.“The generosity of people is astounding, absolutely heartwarming,” said Mr McCorry.The foodbank he heads is distributing le-saving parcels from two centres, including the Church of the Venerable Bede.A warehouse in Newburn co-ordinates distribution.  “Without our wonderful volunteers and all the people collecting and donating food and money I shudder to think what might happen to the people in real need, going hungry. “It’s not just adults. It’s the kids too. And demand is growing. Poverty is rising. We see it, we know it.” The Newcastle West End Foodbank is part of the Trussell Trust network and the largest in the country, assisting close to , families this year with  tonnes of food worth pound,. Hot meals are served and parcels are provided to take home. Meanwhile an integration programme tries to sort out problems with landlords, benefits, health, both physical and mental, plus treatments for addictions. The gut-wrenching accounts of families left despairing by gaping holes ripped in the welfare state by the Tories are familiar everywhere in the country. Slum landlords, DWP sanctions, bad bosses and Universal Credit are curses either tolerated or inflicted by smug Conservative Ministers. People sleeping on streets or in cars and vans is increasing. One mother was pound, in debt after the council charged her pound a week bedroom tax despite her willingness to move into a smaller property the local authority couldn’t find. On my visit to the Newcastle West End Foodbank two dishevelled young men, former soldiers now living rough, told their stories. One explained to a volunteer he was close to giving up, feeling abandoned by the country which put him in unorm then dumped him. “If you’re out there and going about your le and you’ve got a job it’s not always obvious people are struggling,” said Mr McCorry. “But it’s growing at such an extent that the number unaware what’s going on is shrinking.”  Christine Wood, a retired library worker proud of her MBE, plays herself in I, Daniel Blake’s Foodbank scenes. The volunteer says: “We see good people treated terribly. Sometimes you’ve got to bite your lip when they tell you what’s happening, how they’ve no money and are really desperate. “You could cry but you can’t afford to cry, let yourself go downhill. You couldn’t help themyou did. “So you show empathy, try to put a smile on their faces. “We know who is creating this misery, what the Government’s doing, and they’ll never be forgiven.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum three left just 10","story":"NewsMum left with just £ for Christmas after missed Universal Credit paymentPaulette Reid was told she should go to a food bankthe money does not come by Christmas EveShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsPaulette fears she wont be able to pay for electricity on Christmas Day\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum-of-three has been left with just pound for Christmas after her Universal Credit money was not paid. Paulette Reid, , from London was expecting to receive her money today but nothing was paid into her account. When Ms Reid telephoned the DWP she was told that the money should be paid on Christmas Eve.The mum-of-three was then stunned to be told to go to a local food bankthe money did not arrive.She told the Daily Mirror she has just pound left in her bank account and now fears she and her three children could be spending Christmas without electricity or food. At this point I dont actually know what Im going to do. If I dont get anything I wont even have money so that I can travel to a family members house, she said. I will have to spend Christmas at home possibly with no electricity. It really is at that point because I was really relying on that money today, I need to pay the electricity, theres no food in the fridge. Ive done no Christmas shopping either - its not like Im ok until that point.   The mum-of-three has recently found a job in customer services after months of unemployment. But, because she only started on th December, she will not receive her paycheck until the end of December. I went in to my local DWP to say to them look Im working and Im struggling because Ive got childcare fees to pay, Ive got to get to work everyday and I dont have anything right now so I can pay my childcare fees in advance because I have to do that, she said.Ms Reid, whose youngest child is six and has two adult children, was last week given pound to cover childcare but nothing . She added: Nothing for travel, nothing for food, nothing to help support me stay in work in general. She was told instead that she would receive a full payment on st December because payments were being early due to Christams. She said:I thought ok thats not too bad, but I woke up this morning and there was nothing. I called the  number and was told  you were due to be paid on Christmas Day normally then you wont get anything until Christmas Eveyoure financially stuck and you find Christmas Eve arrives and you havent received any money then youll welcome to visit one of your local foodbanks for support.   On a monthly basis Ms Reid receives pound from Universal Credit. That pays the rent, the gas, the electric, food and my bills, my council tax, so thats to pay everything. My rent is pound. But that was also the money she had planned to spend on her family for Christmas. That was also me getting presents for my little one, being able to contribute towards Christmas dinner, she said. She added: The rent is due on Christmas Day so they will either take it before or after sothey take it this weekend thats me failing on my rent.   In despair Ms Reid called her local MP Rupa Huq who has written to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions raising her case. The MP for Ealing and Acton tweeted a photograph of the letter saying: Last weekday before Christmas  first day of recess. Office has just received a call from a mum of two in tears as payment not come through yet and has pound to her name for festive season.  Ms Reid went on to Universal Credit in March after being made redundant. She said of the system: Im shocked by the way that its run, I can see why people are in debt, why theyre suicidal, why theyre depressed. It isnt a system that is set up to help people get back to work.  A DWP spokesman told the Daily Mirror: Same day advances worth up to % of a Universal Credit award are available on day one, so no one should be without money.

She hit back at comments that her heyday was  years ago, when in reality she has never felt more comfortable in her own skin, also saying she chose to publicly share her experience for the women. Laura added: It makes me laugh that some people think my heyday was when I wore a face full of make up, perfect hair, sexy outfits, padded bras. I.e. dressing for someone ’s approval. F*** that. I’m strong and capable, I stand up for what I believe in. I walk away from people or situations that make me uncomfortable. And I wear what makes me feel happy, not sexy. A lot of my ’s were spent working in the world of high-end nightclubs where image, money and status were everything, and I’m proud that I‘m no longer part of that.  I’m proud that I care more about what I think than what anyone  thinks. Laura takes pride in the fact that she hasnt succumbed to the pressures of botox and fillers, despite that the complications of her implants rapidly aged her skin. She added: This is not me having a digyou’ve had botox, I understand what it’s like to be so self-critical you won’t even leave the house, it’s just that after having my breasts amputated twice through illness, I’ve learned to appreciate my body exactly the way it is.

Maybe tell you how the comedian Dave Allen was once asked, after he’d been involved in another blasphemy row,joking about Christ would ever be widely accepted. And how he replied that only when the easily-offended accepted that Jesus was an anti-establishment radical who relentlessly took the mickey out of the old religious bores of his day. I always thought the joker was jesting until I heard a Radio  discussion this week about a book called The Sacred Art of Joking, written by a Church of England Synod member, who claimed Jesus was a great wit who loved offending the rich and powerful, and cracked so many gags about the Pharisees, they eventually had him crucied. Which is not just a comfort to those of us who believe Dave Allen was a genius, but raises some topical questions. With so little to watch on the big man’s birthday, can’t the BBC trawl the Bible and string together a few of his best gags as they’ve got to be funnier than Michael McIntyre’s Christmas Day Special    Don’t all those po-faced moralizers who screamed blasphemy when Greggs replaced Jesus with a sausage roll in their nativity scenes realise it’s what their messiah would have wanted  And is this country growing more absurd by the day because Jesus and his dad have decided to try out on us some of their best material since they dropped a plague of frogs on the Egyptians  We’ve had an Eton wide-boy call a referendum to save his skin, which allowed other Eton wide-boys to fool the people with lies in the hope of getting his job. It’s ended up causing Britain’s gravest peace-time crisis, yet instead of the politicians solving it, they’d rather debate whether the Eton wide-boy’s spectacularly stupid successor was called stupid, before taking a -day break. We’ve got , families homeless this Christmas and a head of state, with more spare rooms in her palaces than she can shake her jewels at, going on TV to wish them all the best. And we’ve seen a football manager, Joseacute Mourinho, given a poundmillion pay-off for failing abjectly, while fans are turning up on match days with groceries to help foodbanks stave off a humanitarian crisis. Our cash-starved NHS is being forced to buy fridges to stockpile drugs when they need to buy beds, and our second biggest airport was brought to a standstill by a geek flying a toy.

Ben and Olivia Sargent, six and nine, were on a dream family holiday with their mums Kerry and Jules Sargent. But the trip turned into a nightmare on a night out for dinner with friends when Kerry, from Gloucester, was killed in a head-on collision near Whangarei. The children’s other mum, Jules Sargent, was rushed to hospital with serious, le-threatening injuries, some of which it is expected will take her years to recover from, reports Gloucestershire Live. Currently the -year-old is too unwell to travel, leaving her and theirtwo children spending their Christmas in the city of Whangarei in North Island of New Zealand, north of the capital. Although they were not seriously injured, they have been traumatised and deeply scarred by the incident.   Ben has told his mum he can’t remember the good times before the crash. Both he and his sister are being cared for by friends but a GoFundMe page has been set up in a bid to raise pound, and help them create some magical moments that they can all look forward to. It is hoped these will provide light during the darker times. Family friend Alan York said: “Currently, Jules is recuperating in New Zealand with the friends she went out to visit and will need a substantial period of recovery before the family canto England. “Until then, Ben and Olivia have been schooled in New Zealand while Jules undergoes physiotherapy before the doctors can assess whether she is fit enough to take the children on their long journey home.” In the crash, Jules broke her ribs, right leg and two vertebra, and her toes were dislocated. Her left arm was also injured and she has an open wound to her left hip area which also fractured part of the hip bone. She has been told the injury to her left arm could take up to two years to recover from.   Speaking from hospital in New Zealand Jules said: I was so shocked when Alan first told me about the Magical Memories campaign. I didnt think people would respond in this way to our situation, but it is really comforting to know how much people care and want to help my children. They have been through such a traumatic experience as they were initially stuck in the car whilst it was on its roof and had to be rescued by friends smashing the windows to get them out.It was a terrying experience for everyone but Ben and Olivia have shown so much courage throughout this whole situation. I am so proud of them of both. Ben has said ‘he cant think about the good times before the accident all he can remember is the accident.’ This amazing campaign will be used to help them overcome the trauma and create some more happy memories. Mr York added: Jules’ recovery period is expected to be very y and we, as friends of the family, want to help Ben and Olivia get through what will inevitably be some very tough times over the next few years, given how involved their mums were in all aspects of their lives. With your support, we want to help get the whole family safely home back to the UK and give Olivia and Ben experiences that will enrich their childhood and transform their lives for the better after this terrible experience.

Simon Feasey was found to have shown a serious lack of integrity when he and family members travelled around the world, Teesside Live reports. A shocking report also revealed that Feasey appointed a man with a history of violence who had stolen from his previous employers to work at Bader Primary School in Thoraby, North Yorkshire. Feasey has now been barred from the teaching profession indefinitely by the Secretary of State. Mystery surrounded his suspension from the school in February last yearand subsequentresignation the following July. An investigation was then carried out by the the National College for Teaching and Leadership which proved he:   • Knowingly disregarded safeguarding measures when he appointed a staff member at the school in October , • Admitted recruiting the staff member - referred to as Inidual A who was known by a governor at the school - without making the necessary background checks. • Was warned and reminded about DBS checks and references but the checks failed to materialise. Once an up-to-date DBS check became available, after Inidual A had been in post for many months, it transpired that he had previous convictions for driving offences and battery. The report said Mr Feaseys failures undoubtedly put the welfare of pupils at risk. Regarding the dishonest use of the school credit cards, Mr Feasey was said to have made two unnecessary visits prior to school trips, accompanied by his we and, on one occasion, with his two children. In July  he used schools funds of almost pound, for the private family trip. Two teachers had already travelled to Amsterdam for a risk assessment in advance of a school trip arranged for September . But just one week later, Mr Feasey himself travelled to the city with his we and two of his children to carry out what he described as a further pre-visit trip. He used the school credit card to purchase flights for himself and his we, and accommodation for the family at the Radisson Blu Hotel as well as tickets for the Van Gogh museum and the Anne Frank Museum for them all.   In the course of the investigation in , he said: I just cant explain it. I struggle to find an explanation. I cant place myself doing it and doing it deliberately. Mr Feasey also admitted using school funds inappropriately in another pre-visit trip to Naples in October . This cost the school over pound,. And in  he attended a trip to Washington DC in  to a learning scheme conference with unnecessary costs of flights for his we, and upgrades, totalling almost pound,. The report said: Mr Feasey admits that the costs associated with his flight upgrades and his we accompanying him should not have been borne by the school. He has reimbursed these costs to the school. It was noted by the  that Mrs Feasey did not even attend the conference. Then later in , it was agreed that two members of staff from the school would go to New Zealand to see first-hand how a school there implemented a learning scheme at a cost to the school of pound,. On their , they gave a presentation to the governors. However, Mr Feasey considered that he also should make a trip to the same school so that he could see it worked from a leadership perspective, said the report. He used school funds to pay for his flight and accommodation and expenses. Whilst on this occasion, Mrs Feaseys flights were paid privately, she stayed at the accommodation paid for out of school funds and the couple combined the trip with a four-week holiday in the country. The report stated that some of the costs of the trips were refunded by Mr Feasey but only after the concerns were raised. Concluding the report, the NCTL said Mr Feasey had demonstrated a serious lack of integrity. He had accepted, and the  was entirely satisfied, that a substantial amount of school funds was used by Mr Feasey for his own personal benefit and for the benefit of members of his family, said the report. He had acted dishonestly and such dishonest conduct had extended over a number of years.” Teesside Live is awaiting comment from Stockton Council.

The Nottingham Post told how Cathy Cook was battling a chest infection when she began struggling to breathe at her home in Mansfield. She became so ill that her husband Wayne decided to call  for an ambulance, unaware that the the -year-olds chest infection had developed into pneumonia and had become le-threatening. East Midlands Ambulance Servicecall handler Kyle Thacker was able to keep the couple calm until paramedic Rebecca Ireland and emergency care assistant Gillian Caldwell arrived seven minutes later.

It was the first time Prince Harry has been to the kitchen after his we helped raise pound, to keep it open permanently. And they werent the only special guests to pop in, as singer Adele was also there to see the good work the women have been doing.  Munira Mahmoud, one of the kitchens founders, shared photos of Adele at the kitchen on her social media and revealed she actually visited two days in a row. She wrote: Had the pleasure of cooking for Adele  days in a row. Wow. What a blessing. She beautul, kind and very humble lady. She later added that it was fun having her around the Hub kitchen. Less than  hours after the Grenfell Tower blaze Adele went down to the site and was seen hugging and comforting traumatised residents. She also delivered cakes to the local fire station and performed at Avondale Park Primary school in North Kensington, the school which many of the young people affected attend. Meghan, who is a self-confessed foodie, was said to be delighted to introduce Harry to the women she has worked so closely with to create the charity cookbook Together: Our Community Cookbook, in which she wrote a foreword.   It is the third private engagement - away from the media by deciding not to invite them - that Meghan has taken part in in recent weeks. Two weeks ago she attended a meeting with educators, academic leaders, and students at King’s College for the Association of Commonwealth Universities, an inter-university network for schools across the British Commonwealth. Days later she appeared on stage in a surprise at the British Fashion Council awards to present an honour to Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy who designed her wedding dress. Meghan has previously said shes taken some of the kitchens food home for Harry to try. A royal source said: After the Grenfell Tower disaster, Harry visited the Al-Manaar mosque which is attached to the Hubb Community Kitchen with his brother William. He has met many of the women before at Meghans book launch at Kensington Palace, but this was the first time he has visited the kitchen.  He loved meeting the women whom his we has spoken so fondly of over the last year and is a huge supporter of their work. The cookery book, which was published in September, came about after a group of women - victims of the Grenfell Tower fire - gathered at the Al Manaar community centre and used the kitchen to prepare fresh meals for their friends, families and neighbours. During the private engagement, which was reported in the Court Circular, the royal couple will have been updated on how the community has moved forward, and will have seen how the Hubb Community Kitchen has improved. The Mirror last month revealed how Meghan, , had struck up a deep and personal friendship with several survivors A palace source said: “The Duchess has made regular private visits to the kitchen and to the women of Hubb and will continue to do so.   She has said how moved she has been by their courage and togetherness, and hopes by working together and collaborating on projects like the book they can find strength moving forward. Another source close to Meghan said: Meghan has promised she will not let the survivors be forgotten. The book was just an example of the way she is using her  for good and we are definitely going to see more of this. Behind closed doors, she has taken it to heart and sees it as her personal duty to help the survivors after being so deeply moved by their stories. She has promised to stand by them for as long as it takes. In September, Meghan hosted an event at Kensington Palace to celebrate the release of the charity cookbook. Together reached number one onAmazonbook chart within hours of being announced, and has appeared in the Sunday Times and New York Times bestseller lists.

Sarah and Ahmed El Kerrami were sued by their banker neighbour, Sarvenaz Fouladi over what she called the intolerable noise made by the family-of-five. The -year-old said the sound of everyday activity above her pound.m apartment - from children playing to dishes being washed - was keeping her up at night. The constant ordeal began after the installation of a new uncarpeted wooden floor in the El Kerramis upstairs flat in , she said. In May, county court judge Nicholas Parfitt awarded her pound,. damages and ordered that work be done to solve the noise problem.   The couple appealed, but after a four-day High Court hearing - which ran up tens of thousands of pounds more in legal costs - saw the bill upheld. High Court judge, Mr Justice Morgan, said the problem was that the new floor did not prevent transmission of noise between the luxury flats. The old floor had been taken up and replaced with a new one which did not provide good insulation against sound transmission, he said. At Central London County Court, Miss Fouladi claimed that there had been no noise at all before work was done in  prior to the El Kerramis moving in. Since then, she and her mum, Fereshent Salamat, had been bombarded with noise from a boiler, fridge, taps and a fireplace above, she said. The El Kerrami family used the flat like a playground, kids running and dropping things for seven hours non-stop, she told the judge. Awarding her damages, Judge Parfitt said it was the noise of simple day-to-day living which had caused the problems in the mansion block.   Although he said Miss Fouladi and her mums evidence was exaggerated, the judge said noise was ...sufficiently loud to be invasive and disturbing... The El Kerramis and the family company which owns their flat should have had carpets on the wooden floors in living areas, he said. And, when the floor was replaced before they moved in, nothing had been done to limit noise transmission between the flats. Appealing, the El Kerramis argued that, having found Miss Fouladis evidence exaggerated, Judge Parfitt was wrong to find in her favour. But appeal judge, Mr Justice Morgan, said there had been plenty of evidence on which the judge could find there was noise nuisance. Council officers had attended the flats, in St Mary Abbots Court, off High Street Kensington, and heard noise for themselves. Dismissing the appeal, he said: The judge was not impressed by the evidence given by Miss Fouladi and her mother, but he rightly directed himself that he did not have to reject everything that was said on their behalf.   Equally, although the behaviour of [the El Kerramis] was open to specic criticisms, the judge used very moderate language in that respect and was not prepared to hold that they had done very much which went beyond using the flat for ordinary purposes. The problem, as found by the judge, was that the floor laid as part of the  works was not a suitable floor to prevent the transmission of noise and was worse than the floor which was there before the works. He upheld the pound,. damages order, which will increase at a rate of pound-a-day until remedial work is done. At the county court, Miss Fouladi had a breach of contract claim against the freeholder of the block, St Mary Abbots Court Limited, rejected by the judge. She appealed against that ruling, but had her case dismissed by Mr Justice Morgan.

But now, as the story is retold in a mini-series for a new generation, this area is set to be turned into a housing estate. It seems a sad case of truth being worse than fiction as Gemma Arterton’s rabbit Clover warns in the BBC’s new adaptation: “There’s terrible evil in the world... men will never rest till they’ve spoiled the Earth and destroyed the animals.” The march of urban development is set to wreak havoc at the home of the book’s imaginary creatures, as the fate of Sandleford Warren will be decided in weeks, with plans for more than , houses. The beautul Berkshire meadows that inspired author Richard Adams’ portentous tale of Hazel, Fiver and their friends’ quest for survival could be ripped up and concreted over as soon as next summer.  Sandleford Warren’s importance as a local landmark for a much-loved work of fiction has not been enough to secure its ancient woodlands. Many hikers, tourists and fans of Adams’ book have followed the rabbits’ epic trek from Sandleford Warren, across the River Enborne, past the hounds at Nuthanger Farm to the beauty spot of Watership Down – all real places in one of England’s most beautul landscapes. Locals are adamant the plans will negatively affect the area and the tourism the love of Watership Down brings. Chris Webb, landlord of The Royal Oak, in Ecchinswell, Newbury, sums up the general feeling. He says: “We get lots of hiking groups here doing the Watership Down walk – it’s a beautul area. “As a country pub, it’s a double-edged sword for us. On the one hand, it means more customers move into the area, but we lose customers who come here because we’re a lovely rural pub.” The original movie left cinema audiences of children in tears as the tale of fluffy bunnies descended into nightmarish scenes of dead and dying rabbits. And, even though the violence has been toned down for the new two-part drama being shown on BBC tonight and tomorrow, it is only recommended for eight-year-olds and above. Voiced by a star-studded cast of actors, including James McAvoy, Olivia Colman and Ben Kingsley, the hard-hitting ecological message of the harrowing  animation classic is being brought back to le to warn about the perils of destroying our planet.  The environmental disaster message is even more terrying today than when Adams wrote his  best-seller about a band of brave rabbits whose warren is destroyed by housing developers. Tragically, the late author had no idea how prophetic his fictional story would turn out to be. The sad real-le tale of green destruction began in , when town planners from West Berkshire Council granted approval to Bloor Homes and Donnington New Homes to build , homes on a green-field site on the outskirts of Newbury bordering an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in neighbouring Hampshire.  Adams was born and brought up in the area and, before his death in December, , the frail -year-old battled valiantly to stop the diggers from destroying the woods and fields of his childhood adventures. Adams blasted council officials, saying: “It is my firm belief that to build on the quiet meadows of Sandleford Warren would be an ugly invasion, a nasty wound to one of the loveliest retreats in all Berkshire and Hampshire. “A residential development here would destroy the area’s character and, in planning terms, I must say, would constitute an ugly addition, sticking out rather nastily from the rest of Newbury.” Despite the objections of anti-development group Say No To Sandleford, West Berkshire’s planning inspector approved the housing scheme. Peter Norman, spokesman for the group, says: “Our principal objections are the adverse effect a development of this size would have on a historic landscape that provides a green lung to Newbury, with its ancient woodlands and scattered habitat.”  But the council insists the correct decision was made, saying: “The site, together with all supporting information and proposed alternatives, was independently assessed and approved by the Planning Inspectorate.” Despite the early win for developers, not a single clod of earth has been moved by diggers. Building has been halted for the past eight years by bitter wrangling over only having two access routes to the site. However, two planning applications have now been submitted for the development of up to , dwellings and  dwellings across the whole Sandleford site, and are being considered by the Local Planning Authority. If they finally get the green light, the bulldozers will move in next summer. Yet, even though the local wildle trust has objected to the two applications and the builders’ own ecologists recognise the bioersity of the site’s ancient copse wood, Mr Norman says wildle groups have failed to come to the rescue of the rabbits and other protected species including bats, skylarks and migrating lapwings.  But Sam Cartwright, senior bioersity and planning officer of the Berks, Bucks and Oxon Wildle Trust, says: “Sadly many of the main sticking points to the development from other parties have not been ecology, but we have objected to the building plans on the basis of the detrimental impact it will have on the habitat of local wildle and made a series of recommendations including larger buffer zones... to protect the site’s ancient woodlands.” The council claims the ecology of the area is being taken into consideration, saying: The applications include Environmental Impact Assessments which seek to ensure the environment is protected and enhanced and any impacts appropriately mitigated.” The final decision on the rabbits’ warren is to be made on January , but sentiments by Adams not long before he died seem worryingly telling. “If Sandleford goes for development, it will be the thin end of the wedge,” he wrote. “Once an area of countryside has been broken into for development, the process continues until the whole area has been ruined.I might be dead, but how will you feel about that ” "},{"url":null,"title":"salford mr big paul masseys","story":"NewsSalford Mr Big Paul Masseys last moments before he was shot deadFour minutes after Paul Massey was seen on CCTV, he was sprayed with bullets from a sub-machine gun outside his homeShareByJohn ScheerhoutKelly-Ann Mills:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video paul-masseys-final-moments-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe last moments of Salford Mr Big Paul Massey were caught on camera and show him just a few minutes before being shot dead outside his home.

Four stowaways were arrested and control was restored when Special Boat Service officers went on board the Grande Tema in the Thames Estuary between Essex and Kent. The ,-tonne ships operator, Grimaldi Lines, said four stowaways had been found on board by the crew earlier this week and they managed to escape after being locked in a cabin. As the Italian cargo vessel approached the UK on Friday morning, the stowaways threatened crew with iron bars and demanded that it sail close to the shore so they could jump off, the operator said as the drama unfolded.   The four men have been detained under the Immigration Act. The ft ship was sailing to Tilbury, Essex, after setting off from Lagos, Nigeria, on December , when the stowaways were found. The Grande Temas crew members were feeding them according to international regulations, said Grimaldi Lines, but the stowaways escaped. After being threatened, the crew locked themselves on the ships bridge and sent out an alert to the Coastguard, it is said.  Essex Police were alerted as trouble erupted on board, and Royal Navy helicopters and commandos were called in to retake control. The operation lasted less than half an hour. SBS operatives from Sabre Squadron fast-roped from helicopters on to the ship, sources told Sky News. Essex Police said officers boarded the ship around pm on Friday and it was taken to the Port of Tilbury in Essex. The Grande Tema, which is based in Palermo, Sicily, and was carrying car parts, arrived there at just after .am on Saturday, according to MarineTraffic. It had  crew members from countries including Italy and the Philippines.

The vessel was coming from Nigeria and was bound to Tilbury, and those four stowaways were in the cabin, and todaythey managed to escape from the cabin and they started threatening the crew, requesting the master of the vessel navigating very close to the coast. That request was probably because they wanted to jump and reach the British coast. The crew reacted and they locked themselves in the bridge of the vessel and so they are safe, we havent had any injuries. Essex Police said the ship was secure and there were no reports of injuries.

People living in the potential flood zones have been warned to be prepared, as the Met Office expects wet and windy weather over the next few days. Rain will be heavy at times as it sweeps across the nation on Saturday night and Sunday, setting up a soggy start to the festive period as millions hit the roads. But rain will begin to taper off on Christmas Eve, while Christmas Day is expected to be mostly dry and cloudy with some patchy rain.  It means those hoping for a white Christmas will be disappointed. Temperatures will stay mild over the next week - hitting the double digits in some regions - but they wont be pleasant in places where it is wet and windy. The Environment Agency has issued  flood alerts for England, while Natural Resources Wales has issued five. Many streams are almost at capacity, and further rain could see them breach their banks, putting homes, businesses and roads at risk of flooding.  Met Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern told the Express: “There will be a frost in the north of Scotland on Saturday morning. “Chilly start to the day, here, temperatures a few degrees below freezing. “One or two fog patches, as well, that will all clear up and a crisp, sunny day to come for the north-east of Scotland.” Long spells of sunshine are expected across much of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, he added, with showers affecting mostly western and central parts of Scotland. But showers will spread across the country in the evening and weather fronts will bring a wet start to the day on Sunday, he said.  Heavy rain will move into the Midlands, East Anglia, northern England, Northern Ireland and the south of Scotland. It will be breezy in places. Journey times are expected to be longer in severe weather. Christmas Eve and Christmas Day will be dry in most places. Met Office five-day forecast Saturday A dry but breezy day with sunny spells for many. There will be a scattering of showers in the north and west, heaviest and most frequent over western Scotland with a risk of thunder. Feeling mild in the south. Saturday night Cloud and locally heavy rain will spread into western, southern and central parts of the UK. Clear spells where with showers easing. A few fog patches developing, mainly in Scotland.  Sunday Sunny spells and isolated showers across Scotland. Cloudy where with outbreaks of rain, slowly clearing from the south-west. MondayCloudy with patchy rain in the south and south-west on Christmas Eve, drier and brighter where. TuesdayMostly dry and cloudy on Christmas with some patchy rain. WednesdayBoxing Day should be mostly settled with a ridge of high pressure across the UK. Southerly winds will bring mild air across many parts making Boxing Day a rather cloudy affair with drizzly patches over western coasts and hills. The best of any bright or sunny spells likely in the east or north-east. What is the New Years Eve forecast  A precise forecast for New Years Eve will become clearer in the next few days, but temperatures are expected to be average. Some places in the north could see heavy rain and strong winds. Heres the Met Offices outlook for Thursday  December to Friday  January: Through the remainder of December and into early January settled conditions should dominate bringing iable amounts of cloud across many parts with temperatures generally around normal. Any clear spells overnight will bring a risk of frost or fog, with fog patches being slow to clear. Northern parts of the UK are likely to see showery periods or longer spells of rain accompanied by strong winds. An increasing chance for northern hill snow through early January.

Once allegedly identied as Abu Elias, the Syria-born US citizen lives a normal le under a dferent name in a suburban town outside Washington DC. Questioned by the Mirror, he said it was a “complete lie” that he played any role in the worst terror attack in Britain which killed  people  years ago. He hit out after former Cold War spy Douglas Boyd named him as the prime suspect and argued Libyan Abdelbaset al-Megrahi – the only person to be convicted – was a fall guy. And it comes after the Mirror’s world exclusive yesterday with stunning claims from the daughter of a senior Jordanian militant.She said before his death two years ago, Marwan Khreesat told his family his old terror group the Popular Front for the shyLiberation of shyPalestine – General Command carried out the attack.  He claimed its chief Ahmed Jibril was paid millions of pounds by Iran, which wanted revenge for  deaths when a US warship shot down an Iranian passenger jet months earlier. Author Boyd, in his recent book Lockerbie: The Truth, claims it was Jibril’s nephew Elias who most likely broke into the Pan Am baggage store at Heathrow to plant the device on Flight . The Palestine Liberation Organisation and, previously, the CIA have also named Elias as a prime suspect. Terror cell member Mobdi Goben also claimed Elias was guilty in a deathbed confession.  But the suspect, who lives just  miles from the shyLockerbie Cairn Memorial at Washington, told the Daily Mirror he was innocent. Askedhe was ever known as Abu Elias, he replied: “No. I have been subject to more than  hours of investigation from Scotland Yard and the FBI, and they are through with me. “The FBI did their shyhomework. They know me very well. They have a big thick file on me.”  He later admitted the identity he now lives under was not his birth name.But he added: “I’m not the nephew to no one. The bit you are talking about is full of f***ing lies. It’s a bloody lie.” Author Boyd wrote in his book: “Megrahi was convicted on a tissue of lies. Little of the evidence against him can be taken at face value. “It is a story of incompetence, vengeance, political expediency and then a cover-up orchestrated from the highest levels in London and in shyWashington – where the real bomber is said to live today, under cover of a witness protection scheme.” Al-Megrahi, the former head of security at Libyan Arab Airlines, was jailed for le at a special court sitting in the Netherlands in .  Many believed some of the evidence was weak. He was identied as buying clothes in Malta that were later found in the Lockerbie luggage. Megrahi died at home in  from prostate cancer, aged , having been released from a Scottish prison on compassionate grounds three years previously. It is believed he planned to reveal Elias’ new identity in a bid to clear his own name. However, two weeks after being freed toto Tripoli, SNP politician Christine Grahame used Scottish Parliamentary privilege to identy the man she said was Elias. She said at the time: “Why were there no criminal prosecutions following the shooting down of the Iranian Airbus by the USS Vincennes in , five months before Pan Am Flight  exploded over Lockerbie  “Was there a contract issued by the Iranian authorities to the PFLP-GC to take revenge for the death of  Iranian pilgrims,  of whom were children, by bringing down an shyshyAmerican plane bringing its pilgrims home for Christmas  “Why have the US authorities not queried the true identity of [name withheld] alias Abu Elias, a senior figure in the PFLP-GC at the time of the bombing and nephew of Ahmed Jibril, former head of that terrorist organisation ” We asked the suspect where he was on December ,  – the day of the bombing. He replied: “I was in the United States. The FBI saw my journal they know I was in South West Washington DC handling my job.”  The married dad refused to answer where he was born or when he moved to the US although he said he had been to London “many times”. The man called author Boyd a “son of a bitch” and said he had written his book “to make some money”. He added: “I’ve heard about it. I’ve seen bits of it. I would not pay a penny for that book.” Speaking to the Daily Mirror, SNP politician Ms Grahame said: “These ious discoveries that you have made builds further on the case that it was, as many of us believe, Iran that was responsible for the shyLockerbie bombing and that Megrahi was the fall guy. Libya took the rap for ious international reasons.”  A review of the Megrahi case is being carried out by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission. It comes after the Megrahi family handed files to the shycommission in  in a bid for a shyposthumous appeal. Their lawyer Aamer Anwar said this week: “Many believe that Megrahi was the victim of a miscarriage of justice and the finger of blame has long been pointed in the direction of Iran.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum 21 pays familys christmas","story":"NewsMum, , pays for her familys Christmas by selling photos of her FEETKayla Woods claims she has earned , since December  by dishing out images and videos of her toes and going on datesShareCommentsByPatricia Murphy:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsKayla Woods sells images of her feet \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA young mother is selling photos and videos of her FEET online to fund her Christmas.

Sometimes they ask me to write their names on my feet in a Sharpie marker. Some of them ask for music. One guy asked me for music like in a spa. So far the most I’ve made for a video is , where I was just walking around and dancing in my bare feet.

I am able to buy things for the baby, like wipes and diapers, from it. I don’t do anything explicit or super sexual so he’s okay with it. “When I go on dates I fake flirt, after all they are paying me for it. But I make my boundaries very clear, and they don’t expect anything more from me other than our date. “My grandmother doesn’t know I do this and my mom doesn’t either to an extent. She knows I’ve been on dates with sugar daddies in the past and she didn’t care as long as I was safe.” Kayla said her newfound income will allow her to give her baby a wonderful first Christmas. “Doing this has definitely helped fund my Christmas but also my everyday le too. It helps me keep up with the little things like diapers, wipes and formula. I have a little outfit ready for him for Christmas day, a cute little onesie. “I’ve bought all of my presents by doing this, a smartwatch for my mom, a bouncer for my baby, some lingerie sets to wear for my partner and I even have a  ham in the freezer for the big day.

After months of rigorous planning, everything theyve been dreaming of is finally happening and its only natural that theyd want everything to run smoothly. They might have a wedding planner on hand to help ensure that nothing can possibly go wrong on the big day, but sometimes its only the bride who can take matters into her own hands and fix a problem. This was the situation one woman found herself in when her wedding planner failed to resolve a sticky situation at her reception.   In a post on Reddit, the unnamed bride revealed all the details and asked whether people thought she had done the right thing in the end. So what was it that she did  The woman kicked a couple out of her reception because they brought their children along with them and she didnt want little ones spoiling her big day. She explained: This couple Im not very close with but the we is a long-time family friend so I felt that I should invite her.   To be clear all of my wedding invitations stated that there will be no children at this wedding, but she and her husband showed up with their infant and toddler. At the actual wedding ceremony, I let it slide. I was preoccupied for obvious reasons. I also thought that maybe they planned not to attend the reception or to have someone pick the kids up before it started. She continued: Anyway the reception rolls around, the couple comes and, lo and behold, they still have their children. I had many other guests and didnt really feel like dealing with it so I asked our event planner to go over to them and discuss whether someone was picking the children up as the reception was not supposed to have children - everyone was drinking and loud and rowdy and a crying child and another little one running around was not part of the plan.   The woman claims the couple then began arguing with the wedding planner, so she stepped in to handle the situation. I think they thought I came to rescue them, she admitted. They started going on about how rude my event planner was. I explained that I had actually sent him over to discuss the children. I reiterated that the even was child-free and said that I had stated so clearly on my invitations. The we sort of apologised, but then proclaimed that she was capable of making sure her children didnt get in the way of things, but it didnt do much to reassure the bride. Eventually after more heated conversation she snapped and told the couple they needed to go.   She added: The whole scene was incredibly embarrassing which is exactly what I wanted to avoid. I really hate that my wedding day had to be somewhat marred by this incident. According to my mother, everyone was talking about it and I guess enjoying a little dramatic entertainment. Was I an a**hole for making them leave  Many people took the time to comment on her post, agreeing that she hadnt done anything wrong.  One person wrote: When someone says no kids, it means NO KIDS! Another posted: For them to argue about it was even more outrageous. You dont have to explain or justy why you didnt want kids at your own wedding. A third added: The inconsiderate couple who thought they were somehow excluded from the child-free part of the invitation are a**holes!

Full-time mum Jess Evans initially assumed her nine-year-old daughter was just being fussy, but she soon discovered there was a very good reason why Alissa had given up on the green-tinged goodies in her advent calendar.   After taking a closer look at the calendar, the mum-of-three was horried to discover that the apple flavoured chocolates she thought shed given her child, were actually made of yoghurt and catnip - and were intended to be consumed by cats. Jess, who lives in Oswestry, Shropshire, said: I was in shock and felt like the worst mother ever when I realised Id bought her a calendar for cats.

She added: Once [Alissa] got over the shock she found the funny side of it. Thankfully shes absolutely fine and Ive checked online that she will be ok. Im going to give the calendar to my friend for her cat.

That was always going to be the case no matter the result.“We’ve got some good players but we need some help.“We’re bottom for a reason so we’ve got to try to strengthen otherwise it’ll be a long season.“I don’t look at where we are just now.“I look at performances, responsibility taken by players in games and the consistency of what we’ve been getting, the decisions being made when a couple of things go against us and how we react.“That’s what I look at and will determine what I need.”Right from kick-off the Dark Blues were second best as Aberdeen moved to within a point of leaders Rangers.Cosgrove’s strikes in  and  minutes sealed the points before calamity at a corner where Andy Boyle and Nathan Ralph bundled each other over to allow Andy Considine a free header just after the break signalled a long second half ahead for the Dark Blues.The manager said: “It wasn’t good enough. Simple. No excuses. We were miles off it. Aberdeen were stronger and quicker and bullied us.“We were too meek.

However, the gaffer spoke about it to us during the week and the way we played compared to the week before at Morton was miles better.“That’s the way we want to play and we believe it gives us the best chance of winning every game or at least most of the games.“You are not going to walk through this league but we like to play with high tempo, pass the ball and cause problems for the opposition we can take advantage of. We just need to put it all together and get the three points.“We should be full of confidence the way we played last week because we know not every opposition can withstand the pressure we put on them.“It’s all about our performance, the way we go on the pitch and put into practice what we think we want to do.“The ability we have in the dressing-room, the characters we have, I think we have a really good team whether that’s in terms of spirit or ability.”After injury forced him off in the recent defeat against Ayr and forced him to miss the draw at Morton, Siegrist admits being recalled to the line-up last weekend was a boost for him.So far this term, one of his biggest battles has been to claim a starting place ahead of Matej Rakovan but that was an indication he’s now considered the first choice keeper by boss Robbie Neilson.“I’ve kind of over-extended when I was ing in the game against Ayr and it was a mixture between a knock and a muscle injury.

draw, United dictated the play and all that was missing was a finishing touch.“I think the way we played, these are the kind of performances where normally you will win more games than you lose or draw,” said the experienced Belgian.“In the end, it’s two points lost and that is disappointing, but the week before itwas a little bit of a sore day because we never got into our own type of game.“Against Inverness Caley Thistle we did manage to get into our own game and,we were a little bit more clinical, it would have been three points.“So we take a lot more out of this game than the others because this was the kind of performance we want.“The last two weeks haven’t been great and we know that, but now we have showed again what we are capable of.“Obviously, we did not take the three points and that is the part we do not like.“What we know is that,we play like this every week, we are going to win many games and be where we want to be.”After the recent home defeat against leaders Ayr and that Cappielow stalemate, gaffer Robbie Neilson stressed that need not to be dragged into the opposition’s style of play.That’s something Frans buys into big time. “The frustrating thing in the last two weeks before Inverness was that we did not play our own game.“The gaffer always is telling us,we play our own game, we will win many games.“After Inverness we could go home, I’m not saying it was with a great feeling because you only have that great feeling when you win but knowing we did that.“At least we could say we did it our own way and, when you do that, it is something you know you can build on.”United were hit by a sickness bug up in the Highlands, one that hit a few of the squad and meant the recently-influential Paul McMullan was forced to start the proceedings on the bench.Taking his usual positive stance, for Frans that meant it was another chance for a player who’s been on the fringes of the team to come in and do a good job.And he believes the display that man – on this occasion Matty Smith – put in, was further proof of the strength in depth there is at Tannadice.“Since the gaffer came in everyone who has come into the team has always taken their chance very well.“That is a good thing to see and I think Matty was outstanding against Inverness.“He is a young boy who hasn’t been playing in the team for a while.“To come in out of the cold like he did, because he wasn’t expecting to start, it is hats off to him.“We see him every day on the training pitch and we know he is a good player.

Here it is, in full, below.Congratulations on your purchase of Dundee United. I guess the obvious first question is why Dundee United My son Scott and I have been looking for investment in European football for some time. We looked at a lot of dferent options, and we looked at this particular club, the club#s history, the support of the fans, the previous success and rich history.The Irish history appealed because we are of Irish descent. We know the Club had financial issues and that makes it dficult for any Club to be successful.For the Club staff to work within that scenario where there is financial dficulty, you are hampered by that. Decisions are then based on where you are at rather than the best interests of the Club. We felt it was a sleeping giant and we could come in with our advisors and use our business experience to make a dference and get Dundee United back where it needs to be.How much did buying United cost you I will not answer that question directly but what I will say is I have seen some numbers thrown about out there and I wish we were buying it for as little as that! It comes to a combination of money paid to shareholders, money put in for the retirement of debt and a commitment to working capital to ensure funds going forward to do what we need to do to be successful.How long has buying a sporting opportunity in Europe been an interest or passion for you It has been there for several years. Scott#s passion for European football goes back much longer than that. It was his passion that rubbed off on me. His English team is Newcastle United, and we caught a match a few years back and had a lot of fun. In the last year, we really took the interest seriously.Are you looking to make money from this deal Yes. This isn#t a hobby for us, and we expect to make money long-term but, let me say, for that to happen we need to be competing in the Ladbrokes Premiership on a continual basis.How much do you know about Dundee United and Scottish football I know a ton. We spent a tremendous amount of time and money doing our due diligence. Legally, on the business side and on the performance side. We know a lot about Dundee United, and we have researched Scottish football, and we know where we are and where we want to go. We have an excellent plan to get where we want to go.Do you expect to own Dundee United for several years Yes. I expect to own the team long-term.What would you say to reassure Dundee United fans about the long-term future of the Club I guess what I would say is based on the due diligence conducted, spending a lot of time and money researching, we know what we are getting into. This isn#t just a passing fancy where we are going to get in and discover something that would create any issues for us. We are confident about what we are getting into and where we want to go. We would not invest in the Clubwe weren#t convinced about the long-term future of the Club.How does this purchase affect the structure of the Club Mike Martin has stepped down as Chairman, and I would like to recognise the work Mike has done during the process. He is a big fan of the Club, and he has steadied the ship since his appointment in March.As new owners, we are going to take it in a dferent direction. We plan to appoint a Managing Director who will be in charge of running the Club and he will be responsible for the aspects of the commercial and business side of the Club.We will also have a Sporting Director who will be responsible for all the performance aspects of the Club. He will work with Robbie Neilson efficiently and effectively from the Club’s standpoint.We will be making some announcements in the very near future regarding this.What type of Chairman would you describe yourself So I’ll be the Chairman and my son Scott will be the quasi-Vice Chairman. He will sit on the board with me. From a Club perspective, people can expect that I#ll be interested in all that is going on I will be very supportive of what#s going on and who is doing it I will be available whenever, but I will not be a micro-manager. We will have what we think are the right persons in the right positions to be a successful Club and I will absolutely expect results.From a fan perspective, I will be a low profile Chairman and fans will hear more from the Club leadership in the new structure than they will from me.Do you plan to work remotely Yes. I will work remotely and travel over as much as possible. Scott and I have talked about this. We will have board meetings that we will come over for, but we will try to tag-team and come across at separate times, so at least one of us is here as often as possible.How can you get a feel for the Clubyou aren#t over in Dundee With today#s technology it is almost asyou are over there but having the right people in the right positions is what matters. Jimmy Fyffe and David Dorward are still on the board, and we anticipate one or two other people to be on the board from the Dundee area. It is essential for the fans to know we will definitely have local representation and they will be in constant communications.There are American owners at Dundee FC, also within the city. So let me ask this directly. Do you have any plans to merge the clubs No. None whatsoever.Do you have any links at all with the owners of Dundee FC No, I have never met them, and quite frankly I do not even know who they are.Do you have any links to the previous owners of the Club including Stephen Thompson No, I have heard his name, but I have never met or had a discussion with Stephen Thompson. Obviously, I have met Mike Martin and Jimmy Fyffe.You have an interest in a Baseball team. What experience have you gained that will stand you in good stead for a football team based in Dundee I believe firmly, that a person needs to know their limitations. As Chairman and owner that is the situation. As far as performance of the squad aspect of the Club is concerned, I expect to be consulted with, I will be involved and interested in decisions, but in reality, I will defer the main decisions to those that know the game much better than I do. As I said previously, I#m not going to micro-manage. I expect to be much more involved in the business side.Have you spoken to the Head Coach and can you confirm that you see him leading the team forward So when I travelled across recently, I was introduced to Robbie, but quite frankly I don#t even think he knew who I was! I just happened to be a visitor who was introduced. That#s been the extent so far, but in answer to your question, I absolutely do believe he is the man to lead the team forward. He has made a positive impact since his arrival, and he has proven himself with Hearts before.Will he be given financial backing to help in the task of getting the Club back into the Ladbrokes Premiership I guess what I’d say is that it is not an open chequebook, but we absolutely intend to invest the necessary funds to get us into a position to get promoted. Equally important is when we get up we stay there.You will appreciate supporters will be curious and apprehensive about motives. How do you plan to communicate with fans of Dundee United Talk is cheap. What I would say to our supporters is judge us by our actions and, even more importantly judge us on our results. Obviously, due to the structure that I#ve discussed earlier, we will be implementing changes, and the fans will hear from the Club leadership rather than me.What targets do you intend to set for the team and the Club as a whole Let me answer it this way. We are looking at short-term and longer-term targets. The short-term objective is simple # promotion to the Premiership. We expect it is this year absolutely. We need to be United and have the one vision, # success # and get to the Premiership. The timing of the transaction is excellent. We have a transfer window shortly in January, and this will allow us to get with Robbie and figure out the team, andwe need to make some changes, we are ready and willing to do that.Longer-term, maybe three to five years, we need to be competing in the top six of the Premiership. We want to be competing in European competition and challenging in the cups. That#s our ultimate goal."},{"url":null,"title":"parking stays free","story":"Free weekend parking introduced to tempt people into Perth and Kinross town centres for Christmas shopping will run until the new year.Council bosses lted charges at a number of car parks on Saturdays in a bid to get tills ringing before Christmas Day.With the sales kicking in immediately afterwards, the scheme will continue for the final Saturday of the year, December , to entice bargain hunters.Off-street car parks with waived fees on Saturdays include  in Perth city centre, three each in Blairgowrie and Pitlochry, two in Dunkeld and James Square in Crieff."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-charles-rennie-mackintosh-statue-given-cone-treatment-10-days-after-being-unveiled","story":"THE city looks to have quickly taken its newest statue to heart - as itrsquos given the Glasgow cone treatment."},{"url":null,"title":"better-bus-services-are-arriving-says-boss","story":"Bus bosses say passengers will quickly begin to see improvements from a multi-million pound investment."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-wagamama-staff-have-spring-in-their-step-after-christmas-bonus-announcement","story":"Staff at three Glasgow restaurants are over the moon after finding out they will be given Christmas bonuses worth up to pound,."},{"url":null,"title":"planning-boost-in-bid-to-build-new-suburb-in-glasgows-north-east","story":"A BID for  new homes in north Glasgow has taken a leap forward."},{"url":null,"title":"bongos-bingo-behind-one-of-glasgows-wildest-club-nights","story":"SINCE first hitting Glasgow back in , Bongos Bingo has become a regular fixture on the social calendar having racked up more than a dozen events in this year alone."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-star-leigh-griffiths-returns-to-social-media","story":"CELTIC ace Leigh Grfiths has broken his social media silence for the first time since stepping away from the club due to ongoing personal issues."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-and-australias-argument-over-tom-rogic-is-a-real-soap-opera","story":"GRAHAM Arnold was granted face-time with Brendan Rodgers on his recent visit to Scotland and came away unexpectedly with an extra player in Martin Boyle."},{"url":null,"title":"airnbnb-glasgow-city-council-bans-estate-agent-from-running-holiday-let","story":"AN estate agent has been banned from running an Airbnb let in a residential block on Glasgowrsquos West End in a landmark case."},{"url":null,"title":"deliveroo-glasgow-delivery-drivers-sacked-en-masse-just-days-before-christmas","story":"TWENTY courier drivers have been sacked just days before Christmas after being accused of fraud by a worldwide delivery service."},{"url":null,"title":"as-the-world-was-partying-we-were-welcoming-babies-meet-the-staff-in-charge-of-glasgows-festive-deliveries","story":"WHILE most of us are opening presents and tucking into turkey, staff at Glasgowrsquos maternity hospitals will be making sure the cityrsquos very special Christmas deliveries have a safe arrival.

A government that can lead us through the Brexit impasse that currently exists.“We are at risk of leaving the EU without a deal, a position I hope we can all agree would be disastrous, not just for the people of Aberdeen, but the UK as a whole.”Speaking after the meeting, Ms Laing said she had hoped the SNP would back her call for a general election.She added: “Unfortunately the rhetoric that comes with the SNP was fully on show today in that they say in public they want a general election but when they get an opportunity to vote for one they vote against it.”Backing a people’s vote, SNP group leader Stephen Flynn said the council had to defend the % of the city’s population who are EU nationals.He added: “Any Brexit at this stage is likely to damage Aberdeen.“Democracy is to go to the people and ask for their views.”He was backed up by EU citizen and SNP councillor Christian Allard, a Frenchman who said he would not be willing to apply to live in Scotland – where he has made a le for  years.However, Douglas Lumsden, Conservative group leader and co-leader of the council, said councillors should take no action, adding they should be “more concerned by Mastrick and not Maastricht”. Mr Lumsden, who said he voted to remain in the EU referendum, added: “A total of .m people voted to leave the EU.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 48","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCongratulations are due to a number of local people this week.We#re surrounded by heroes every day, most of whom are unsung, but David MacInnes was quite rightly recognised last week for his work in boosting the cause of stem cell research and donation.

Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed.

Clear it up as it happens or do something in the development plan to make sure it doesn’t in the future.Name and address supplied.What do you think about Lochgilphead and its future  Contact the Advertiser on editor@argyllshireadvertiser or message us directly via Facebook. Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

To be clear, funding for our core services is being cut again.#For Argyll and Bute this increases our estimated funding gap for next year to £ million.

The combination of problems forced the family to live in the bedroom of their house where the damp was less severe.After seven months of negotiating, Gary and Lindsay have moved out of the house into a privately let property close to Oban.At the time ACHA chief executive Alastair McGregor said: ‘The association will provide compensation through our redress policy to Mr Smith for his inconvenience. The association is committed to getting this matter concluded as soon as possible and for Mr Smith and his family to enjoy the facilities in their new home in the very near future.’In a letter to Mr McGregor, Gary said: ‘I am disgusted the way me and my family have been treated. If this is what you call habitable condition I wouldn’t like to see what ACHA classes as inhabitable.’Since the Argyllshire Advertiser published the article, Gary maintains the holes in the side of the building have not been filled, the damp not dealt with, nor has black mould in the bedroom.He said: #When they got someone to look at it he just wanted to plaster over the problem. That won#t solve the damp in the whole house. I guarantee when we leave they#ll just plaster over it and give it to someone .#When asked about the family#s situation and lack of movement on it, Alastair McGregor said: #Once the current tenancy has ended, we will be investigating further to ensure the issues are completely resolved. With respect to the boreholes, this is not work that is incomplete. We are currently carrying out investigations and that is why they are open.#ACHA was not aware of any problems with the property at the point of letting and we would never knowingly let a property which was not wind and watertight.#"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion. She said: “We cannot afford to stand still and the board are continually looking at ways to move the school forward.

the architects and builders of Abbotsford, and original installers of the Portcullis Gate December , .The Portcullis Gate, made of oak and wrought iron, was designed by Scott between  and , creating a grand entrance for visitors to his home.It remained an integral part of Scotts lsquoconundrum castle.But it had suffered many years of continuing deterioration, reaching the point where conservation was critical to avoid it falling apart.Keith, great-great-grandson of Thomas Smith, was delighted to keep the family connection with the gate and told the invited audience of Abbotsford donors and Friends about the link between theSmith family, Darnick and Abbotsford.Keith said: ldquoAbbotsford is a joy.\"My family and others from Darnick are proud to have played a part in its construction.\"The gates are a tribute to local craftsmen - ancient and modern.Initial plans by The Abbotsford Trust, to replace the old wood and repair the wrought ironwork on the gate, were revised when research by The Scottish Conservation Studio revealed the Portcullis Gate was not a mismatch of wood of ying quality as originally thought, but was in fact all original wood from Scottrsquos time.The project turned into one of conservation rather than replacement.Pippa Coles, Abbotsfordrsquos Gardens Heritage Development Manager, said: ldquoWe are thrilled to see the gate back in position and looking as Scott intended.\"Earlier this year, I read in John Smithrsquos diary that the gate had originally arrived on December , , so I felt it was a fitting date for their , and it was extra special that Keith, Johnrsquos descendant could join us.ldquoWe are very grateful to our funders and donors who made this important conservation project possible.\"We hope visitors to Abbotsford in the New Year, when we reopen in March, will enjoy walking through the grand entrance, just as Scottrsquos guests did nearly  years ago.The skilled restoration work was undertaken by Charles Taylor Woodwork, based in Dalkeith.The gates were removed last December, dried out and then dismantled and recorded before work began.The original wooden frame was badly damaged and has been replaced, while the internal lattice work has been restored by splicing in good wood from the old frame.Despite its name, the Portcullis Gate is hinged and not raised and dropped by a pulley system.It derives its name from its design, which references the style of a portcullis, an image of which is also carved above the gate.Scottrsquos use of this defensive symbol at the main entry to his home suggests that he viewed Abbotsford as a personal sanctuary.The portcullis image was also used by Scott on his personal book bindings in his library, where the symbol is accompanied by the Latin motto Clausus Tutus Ero , signalling Scottrsquos attitude to Abbotsford as a place of safety from the outside world.Due to its symbolic recurrence throughout Abbotsford, the Portcullis Gate is considered by many to be one of the homersquos most important features.It not only serves as an image of grandeur for guests arriving at Abbotsford, but also symbolises Scottrsquos intentions for Abbotsford as a place of retreat from the chaos of the outside world.The gate was so iconic that it was photographed by William Fox Talbot in October,  for his book The Sun Pictures of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"thea-and-thomas-are-the-most-popular-baby-names-in-the-borders","story":"BORDERS parents have gone against the grain when choosing baby names this year.The most popular choice for new-born girls in the region during the past  months is Thea -

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"community-rallies-to-support-the-family-of-amanda-cox","story":"A HUGE community effort to support the family of Amanda Cox will continue this evening.The

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty.

We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"what-the-papers-say-december-22","story":"The latest on the drones at Gatwick and a wintry windfall in Lincolnshire make headlines in Saturdayrsquos papers.TheTimesleads on Gatwick, reporting that Transport Secretary Chris Grayling ldquoshelved plans to regulate drone use.Grayling put drone law on hold before flight chaos#tomorrowspaperstoday#gatwickchaos#Gatwick@hendopolispic EZxfntaHmdash The Times PicturesDecember , The Daily carries an interview with Amber Rudd, with the Work and Pensions Secretary calling European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker ldquoghastly.The front page of tomorrows Daily : Rudd blast at ghastly EU chief Juncker #tomorrowspaperstodaypic UmukWIyfENmdash The December , The reports on an increase in reported cases of measles cases, linking this to a ldquogrowing anti-vaccine movement in Europe.front page, Saturday  December : Vaccine sceptics linked to doubling of measles cases pic egcPoMzjiOmdash December , The Financial Timescarries the latest on the markets, with suggestions of a ldquobleak year-end.Just published: front page of the Financial Times UK edition, Saturday December  https:t.co ctoHSYIezpic RnCBqUSymdash Financial TimesDecember , Theiand the Independentboth lead on Gatwick, with the former saying the net is closing in on the suspect while the other says planes were ldquogrounded again after another sighting on Friday afternoon.I WEEKEND: Net closes on Gatwick drone pilot #tomorrowspaperstodaypic IscvzlTgmdash Neil HendersonDecember , Tomorrows @independentfront page #tomorrowspaperstodayTo subscribe to the Daily Edition https:t.co XFVnDpHYFpic zfSFCXFVHmdash The IndependentDecember , The Daily Mailreports the ldquodrone saboteurhellip mockingly flashed lights on Friday evening.Saturdays @DailyMailUK#MailFrontPagespic ytetmkNBmdash Daily Mail U.K.December , The good ndash and new-found ndash fortune of builder Andrew Clark who won pound million on the EuroMillions makes headlines in many papers.

As we turned up the Clyde, a massive dark grey wall of torrential rain swept in and sent the windscreen wipers into overdrive.#I was called in as a late substitute for Mike Hancock who sadly could not take part.#I was confident that I had the required fitness, skills, and equipment, as I had recently been bashing around the tricky broken hilly roads of Northumberland on my superb Trek Emonda Disc road bike.#I had a fantastic support crew in Angus, Gayle, and John, and I was very much looking forward to a big adventure, despite the horrendous weather situation.#A deep low pressure system had started battering the north west and I was riding straight into its path at just the wrong time.#Weather warnings had been issued, the average wind speed would reach mph+, and lots of heavy rain was guaranteed.#Still, my logic was to dynamically risk assess the situationthings got too hairy, I would stop and not continue unless safe to do so.By the time I left Roseneath I was throughly saturated and needed to change gloves frequently. This set the tone for a very wild and long night.#Some shelter was occasionally enjoyed on eastern roads but crossing over to western areas, and dealing with side-winds that literally pulled the bike out of my hands was incredibly mentally and physically demanding.#Climbing the mighty Rest and Be Thankful was a turning point though.#The weather was atrocious but the mountains loomed blacker than night sky either side of me.#The road rose and car headlights hovered high in the distance, which told me the top had to be earned.#A howling headwind tried its worst to hinder my progress but the adrenaline was really flowing now and I was feeling alive and focused.#At Lochgilphead, I was delighted to hook up with Alex Flinn, and soon after Robert Semple, who would escort me around the southern end of the peninsula. Lucky them!##The storm was at absolute full force around midnight. Campbeltown was desolate, deserted, and windswept and we headed out to Southend, on the Learside Road, probably the spot that was bearing the greatest impact of the storm.#Alex and I were stunned and mesmerised at one point by the way the rain was whipping along the black tarmac in great thick white swirls, like spin drt snow.#We could barely raise our voices above the deafening wind that sounded and felt like a blast from a freezing jet engine.#I had covered  miles in  hours by pm. This was way below my original schedule but there was no way of going any faster.#It took a massive effort just to keep moving at any speed and trying to force the pace would risk exhaustion.#I was worried thatthe weather did not improve, my target of  miles in  might become very tight or unreachable.#The idea of riding the whole leg in one hit had previously crossed my mind but the weather situation absolutely slammed the door on that option.#I was cold, fatigued, and also aware that my hard working support crew would also appreciate some respite or at least a substantial break.#So imagine my delight when Robert told us he ‘just lived round the corner.’#At Robbie#s house we were well looked after. Clothes were strewn out to dry, a conveyor belt of hot buttered toast churned out the kitchen, and feeling ed to limbs.#I crawled into my sleeping bag and at .am on Saturday December  Robert woke me up with coffee, porridge, and fruit, just magic.#The team was refreshed after the four hour pit stop and Finn and Rothwell continued with a stretch of coastal riding plus a side to tailwind.With  miles of cycling, in some of the worst conditions of the ride, Finn stopped at Lochgilphead after a cafe lunch before Rothwell headed off solo. with  miles to go.The section up to Oban passed smoothly on a clearing forecast but heavy rain showers continued to chill Rothwell.He was briefly joined by Gavin Blainey and he bore gts of his mother’s scones, filled with butter and jam.At Fort William Rothwell reached the uplting ‘Just  miles to go’ point and was met by a hot pizza, donated by Erol Ozen and delivered by Jamie Gall.Rothwell continued: #The end was sort of in sight.#Climbing north west, from Invergarry, was perhaps my only real low point.#The huge climb is exposed and bleak and the rain came down again.#The five mile descent is shallow angled and long.#It was grim. I jumped in the van at the bottom and had a complete change.#My body temperature had plummeted and there was no way I was moving until I had made a full clothing change.#Soon after, my spirits were lted by hooking up with Alex Glasgow, a very strong local rider.#We rode and chatted and some pretty tough climbs passed more easily than they would have done had I been alone.#Saying goodbye to Alex, I pushed on to Loch Carron with  miles to go.#Slightly impatiently I lted the pace but it felt good.#The wind was now generally kind and even some  per cent climbs didn’t dampen my enthusiasm to push through as quickly as I could and get it done.#One final push into a pesky headwind and I finally descended to a deserted Shieldaig.#What a massive adventure, the whole team had achieved something that seemed almost impossible when we stared out across a storm battered Clyde on Friday lunch time.#They were brilliant hardworking, switched on to any potential hazards, and completely selfless.#I can’t thank them enough. I am also very grateful to those who joined me on the road and supported via social media.#It’s great to be part of something big like this and very satisfying to see the charity donations.#Some ride statistics are as follows: In the  miles there was vertical climbing of ,m, in a moving time of hrs mins and overall time of  hrs mins at an average speed of .mph.Rothwell thanked his sponsor Team Cycles, food supplier Mountain Fuel and Exposure Lights.LOMM finished in Bristol yesterday.The riders pass through Campbeltown.

Instead, I simply cleaned up the bins without complaint, much to my husbandrsquos amazement.:Second Brexit referendum would do irreparable damage, Theresa May warnsMy new found zen does not extend to politics, however, especially after the last weekrsquos disgraceful Brexit developments, following which Irsquom failing miserably to keep calm and carry on. And despite what Irsquove just said about goodwill, I have not one iota of sympathy for Theresa May and her current predicament.Itrsquos interesting, isnrsquot it, how this narrative around feeling sorry for the Prime Minister has grown  The ldquopoor Theresa mantra reached a full head of steam last week, of course, as the extreme Brexiteers in her party finally moved in for the kill with their vote of no confidence, after stalking her for months.In the media coverage during the build-up to Wednesdayrsquos vote, and in the tone of the reaction to her victory, I was struck by the number of folk who went on and on ndash and on - about how sorry they felt for Mrs May.Itrsquos become clear large sections of the public have become increasingly, indeed worryingly, impressed by the Prime Ministerrsquos handling of the Brexit debacle, seeming to view the blank look on her face as a comforting, praiseworthy signal to us, the plebs, that she knows what shersquos doing.Irsquom not fooled for a minuteand neither should you be. Mrs Mayrsquos features are blank not because shersquos brave, but because she lacks either the courage or the will to change course and save the country from the catastrophe we all face.To be clear, this Remain-voting PM is either stupid enough to try and go ahead with a policy that even her own Government says will be massively damaging to the people of this country, or too cowardly to stop it. Which of these chilling realities is worse Like the robot she jokingly impersonated a few months ago at the Conservative Party conference, the Maybot keeps going through the motions of the disastrous, unsupportable deal she has cobbled together. But that joke isnrsquot funny anymore, especially as Mrs May must bear much of the responsibility for the impossible situation she has found herself in over the last weeks and months.:Flag expert: lsquoThe use of the Union Jack has never been so positive in ScotlandrsquoMake no mistake, this is not only a perfect storm but also a crisis of her own making. It was the PM, after all, who came up with the ill-conceived and wrong-headed red lines of the deal without consulting Parliament or even trying to build consensus and bring MPs with her. She has ignored the Scottish Parliamentrsquos objections and resisted every attempt at Westminster to give MPs a say in the process.Mrs May is not a person any of us, the poor so-and-sos who will suffer economically, socially and culturallyshe goes through with this folly, should feel sympathy for.At this crucial point I believe we should extend the hand of Christmas friendship to another isive figure, however: Tony Blair.The former PM has been embracing the sort of leadership and pragmatism Mrs May continues to reject by quietly chinning EU leaders behind the scenes, trying to hammer out a solution to the terrible situation we all find ourselves in. And, since hersquos intelligent and sane as well as extremely well connected, Mr Blair has come up with a sensible and cogent way forward. The catch is, of course, it would require the sort of leap of imagination the current PM seems incapable of.Instead of trying to keep flogging her dead horse, Mrs May should, according to her predecessor, become a facilitator for MPs to decide the next step. If no consensus can be found in Parliament, he justiably backs a public vote to determine whether Brexit should go ahead.Crucially, he also says the EU should ndash and would - make concessions on some of the issues that led to Brexit in the first place, such as free movement, thus allowing some EU doubters to come back into the fold and vote to cancel Brexit. Being seen to listen to concerns over immigration, to offer some flexibility to nation states, would surely be welcomed more widely across Europe, too.Showing uncharacteristic emotion, perhaps sensing hersquos on to something, Mrs May has angrily accused Mr Blair of undermining her talks. Predictably, the Corbyn faithful has also blown a gasket at his intervention Labourrsquos former leader remains the anti-Christ in their eyes because of his decision to involve Britain in the Iraq war.The whole lot of them need to move on, Labour from Iraq and the Tories from their calamitous belief that Brexit can and should happen. Lest we forget Mr Blair, though undoubtedly flawed, was the last politician able to gain the broad support of most people in Britain, regardless of their background or ideology.Hersquos the sort of pragmatic centrist the country is crying out for right now, and over the festive season Irsquoll be praying Mrs May has a Christmas epiphany and follows his lead."},{"url":null,"title":"12-things-to-do-in-scotland-to-get-even-the-grinch-into-the-christmas-spirit","story":".

And the most fervent hope of all at this darkest point in the calendar was probably simply that spring, and light, would .In these street-lit, centrally heated times, its hard to imagine how hard le must have been during long, dark months when even candles were scarce commodities and death from flu, starvation or hypothermia was never far away. The heart-felt yearning for light is reflected in the peculiar traditions that continue to be observed, albeit in a slightly dferent form, on Christmas Eve.Coming a few days after the winter solstice , December  isnt a public holiday, yet it contains more magic and portent than any of the festivals  official days.The cattle are lowingThe idea that marvellous things happen on this enchanted night is wonderfully evoked in Thomas Hardys poem, The Oxen.ldquoChristmas Eve, and  of the clock,Now they are all on their knees,An elder said as we sat in a flockBy the embers in hearthside ease.On any other day of the year, the poem continues, few would entertain the notion that a shed full of cattle might kneel down on the straw in an agrarian echo of the Nativity. But on this particular night, nobody doubts it andsomeone invited the poet to witness the scene, ldquoI should go with him in the gloom, Hoping it might be so.Those lines were written in , at a time when fear stalked every fireside and the longing for a miracle ndash the hope that ldquoit might be so ndash must have augmented the desire to believe in magic that descends at this time of year.An apparent manestation of the belief that animals take on human characteristics on Christmas Eve continues in Denmark, where its customary to go for a Christmas Eve walk equipped with treats for the animals you might meet: a throwbackto attempts to appease creatures that might otherwise speak ill of you on that enchanted night.Troll the ancient Yuletide carolAlmost certainly the precursor to the Christmas tree, the Yule logs origins are pre-medieval and believed to be linked to the sacred role of trees in Nordic paganism. Yule is the name of the winter solstice festivals once held across northern Europe .The log was cut down on the morning of the winter solsticeand brought into the house, though the fact its said to have been a whole tree trunk makes me wonderit was burned in a great hall or communal area rather than inidual homes. Its generally agreed that the log was ignited in the evening using a remnant of the previous years log, and according to some accounts, one end would be pushed into the fire and ceremonially burnt and the remainder fed in over the duration of the festive period. The remnants were then stored to protect the house against lightning and evil spirits, and to light the following years log. The ashes were thought to have magical and medicinal qualities.The practice continues north of the Border, where, according the Pagan Federation Scotland: ldquoWe celebrate the rebirth of the sun, often by burning a specially chosen log through the long hours of darkness, kindled from the remains of the previous years Yule-fire.One account of the old ritual holds that on Christmas Eve, the youngest person present would light two candles from the burning Yule log, then everyone would make a wish for the coming year. You might want to close your eyesfollowing this tradition, since its said thatthe shadows cast by the blazing log appear to be headless, death will come calling in the months to come.The holly and the ivyIf your mantelpiece is already festooned with holly, ivy and mistletoe, then Im sorry to dampen the mood but its supposed to be unlucky to bring greenery into the house until Christmas Eve. Be of good cheer, though: the winter foliage tradition is probably older than Christianity, which means December  is an arbitrary date so far as Yuletide spirits are concerned.At one time, holly was grown near homes in the hope that witches and evil spirits would be trapped in its dense, prickly foliage. The plant ndash and its festive partner, ivy ndash were associated with fertility: holly was male, ivy female and the leaves were burnt together at the pagan festival of Beltane, presumably in order to promote fecundity and a bounteous harvest the following year.During some winter festivals, a young girl clothed in ivy would parade around the village with a holly-clad boy, in order to bring le and fertility to the darkest time of the year.Blame it on the mistletoeThis parasitical plant remains green after the host tree has become bare and apparently leless, which may explain the ancient belief in its magical properties: druids would cut it from oak trees using a golden sickle for use in rituals and medicine.Legend has it that mistletoe was once a tree in its own right. One story holds that Jesuss cross was made of mistletoe wood and the plant was condemned to become the shrunken, parasitic sprig we know today. In Norse mythology, Baldur ndash god of the summer sun ndash was killed by an arrow made from mistletoe, thus ushering winter into the world.Seasonal spiritsPerhaps inevitably, given the scarcity of daylight and the proximity of death during pre-antibiotic winters, some of the magic associated with this time of year is dark and restless. Spirits were long thought to have walked the Earth on Christmas Eve, as Ebenezer Scrooge discovered to his perturbation. In fact, the tradition of telling ghost stories on that night predated Charles Dickenss A Christmas Carol, though the previously oral custom seems to have boosted by the growth of periodical publication in the th century.Henry Jamess famous  chiller, The Turn Of The Screw, also opens on Christmas Eve with the telling of strange tales around a hearth, and the medieval historian and author MR James continued the tradition into the th century, reading spine-prickling stories aloud each Christmas Eve to friends gathered around the fireside in his rooms in Kings College, Cambridge.Why such tales should be associated with December  is open to speculation but theirwas guessed at by the American author Keith Lee Morris. Writing about seasonal ghost stories three years ago, he suggested that however spooky the tale, its ldquonot nearly as horrying as the events that real le holds in store for us. Scaring ourselves with fiction is, therefore, a distraction from our anxieties and a way of confronting our demons in a safe and homely environment. Obliquely, therefore, the ghost story acts, once again, as a kind of wish: a hope against hope that the real ghouls of illness, death and grief wont come knocking on our doors.Twas the night before Christmas hellipChristmas Eves most popular wandering spirit is, of course, Santa Claus, who on this night has been estimatedto travel some  million miles, a feat that is reckoned to require his reindeer to move at around five million miles per hour heaving their not inconsiderable burden, particularly as the jolly old elf is likely to have consumed  billion calories worth of mince pies along the way.The legend of Father Christmas has deep roots and worldwide there are plenty of stories of benevolent figures who go around distributing gts, particularly to children. My favourite is the Russian legend of Babushka, who was racked with remorse after failing to guide the Three Kings to the place of Christs birth and now gives gts to sleeping babies and children in the forlorn hope that one of them will be the baby Jesus, and that she will be forgiven.Im not sure of the authenticity of this version of the story, but its emphasis on the human desire for atonement is echoed by Ebenezer Scrooges yearning for redemption following his Christmas Eve tour of his past sins.The Spirit Of Christmas Present in Dickenss tale ndash clothed in green robes and surrounded by holly, ivy and mistletoe ndash bears a resemblance to the Father Christmas of legend, who himself may have been a throwback to the Green Man, probably a pagan fertility figure celebrated as a harbinger of spring. In parts of the British Isles in the middle of the first millennium, someone dressed up as King Winter would be welcomed into peoples homes and offered refreshment in the hope hed reward his hosts with a mild season.Todays Santa seems to be an amalgamation of all those characters, the Norse god Odin and St Nicholas, a kindly third-century bishop from Turkey said to have distributed gts to relieve want and suffering. Most famously, he showered gold coins down the chimney of a poor man in order to save his dowry-less daughters from spinsterhood or prostitution, depending on which version of the story you believe. Whatever the rationale, those coins landed in stockings that were drying by the fire, precursors to the socks todays children hang up on Christmas Eve, to be filled with toys by Santa.Mr Clauss red suit is often said to originate from a s Coca Cola advert, and while its possible hed been depicted in similar dress before then, it seems clear that his nocturnal schedule on December  is largely the product of American imagination, since most of the details ndash from the reindeer-driven sleigh to the chubby gents propensity for laughter ndash stem from the poem A Visit From St Nicholas, which was published anonymously in New Yorks Troy Sentinel in  and later attributed to Clement Clarke Moore .ldquoTwas the night before Christmas, begins the old rhyme, and Clarke Mooresaccount remains the orthodox version of the events that will fill childrens heads this Monday night as they lie awake, convincing themselves they can hear reindeer hooves and imagining the wonders theyll find beneath the tree in the morning.Peace on EarthFar from Hardys hearth, the Western Front would have been saturated with yearning. As December  approached, young men on both sides of No Mans Land must have wished desperately to be at home with their loved ones instead of huddled in freezing trenches, waiting anxiously for the orders that might catapult them them towards horror and death.The previous year, Christmas Eve truces had famously taken place on the night of December , , when British, French and German soldiers crossed into No Mans Land to exchange greetings, cigarettes and chocolate. Although this memory has undoubtedly been romanticised, it seems clear that truces did take place, that football matches happened, and that the miracle of peace was delivered by frightened, homesick young men who must have been starkly aware of the nonsensical nature of their situation, knowing that the friendships theyd forged would shortly be obliterated by gunfire.By the time Christmas Eve, , came around, orders had been dispatched that such behaviour wouldnt be tolerated. A few subversive truces took place, nonetheless, but for the most part, the Front Line would have been a cold and lonely place where the wish to be anywhere but in those godforsaken trenches was profound.The hopes and fears of all the yearsThe truth, of course, is that the hands stuffing stockings and wrapping presents will be human and the job of realising the wishes that have been planted in childrens heads via slick commercials falls to parents, whose own Christmas Eve hope is often simply that their offering will be greeted by joy, and not disappointment.The pressure to make dreams come true is ferocious. Evenyou dont have young children, theres plenty of scope for self-flagellation in the pursuit of the ultimate feast.Then there is the pressure to create the atmosphere of domestic conviviality encountered by the penitent Scrooge in the parlour of his nephew, Fred. Alternatively, we could all remind ourselves that our distant ancestors most ardent wishes appear to have revolved around the simple desire, on the darkest of days, for aof the climatic conditions needed to feed and care for their families and communities.This coming Monday, there will be plenty of people doing their best to keep the spirit of hope alive across Scotland in hospitals, food banks and homeless shelters. Such organisations will be recipients of the collections gathered in watch-night masses and church services where, as the clock approaches midnight, people will sing carols full of hope.Those songs have particular resonance for Christians, of course, but they also speak to people of dferent faiths and none about the desire for light in the darkness, and the wish for kindness to transcend selfishness and greed.In Frank Capras Its A Wonderful Le, perhaps the th centurys most familiar secular expression of that message, the communitys triumph over aicious capitalism is expressed in their Christmas Eve rendition of Hark The Herald Angels Sing.But the carol that evokes most clearly the universal longing for light is surely the one about the distant town of Bethlehem, above whose ldquodeep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by. Its final lines, about ldquothe hopes and fears of all the years, reminds us of the common thread that unites us with all the inhabitants of dferent continents and epochs, who have ever gazed in wonder at the night sky.Think of that as you make your wish this Christmas Eve."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-i-didnt-bother-with-a-christmas-treeand-now-i-regret-it","story":"I enjoy it while itrsquos here, as the scent of sophisticated masculinity is rare in both this rural corner and my house in particular.And it somehow brings an energy into the rooms ndash an energy lacking in an all too silent home.He arrived for a pre-Christmas weekend as I canrsquot, or, as he sees it, wonrsquot fly to London.This upsets and annoys him in equal measure.

ScotRail has made it clear that it regrets the cancellations and delays that have been caused. Let me be perfectly clear: the level of cancellations - this week, in particular - has been unacceptable.She said ScotRail caused  cancellations on Monday and around  on Thursday.Mr Carlaw said new official figures showed around  cancellations or partial cancellations a year ldquocaused entirely by ScotRail, despite ministers telling ScotRail to improve.Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoProgress is being made but it is not good enough.Mr Carlaw said Ms Sturgeon needed to ensure a train network ldquofit for purpose in .Ms Sturgeonrsquos spokesman was later unable to say what rail nationalisation might cost.He said: ldquoOur position is to pursue a public sector bid. We donrsquot have those [nationalisation] powers. Itrsquos not within our gt to do away with the franchise process.Former UK Labour rail minister Tom Harris, who recently authored a report warning about nationalistion, said: ldquoIf the First Minister believes that rail nationalisation is the answer, shersquos asking the wrong question. Most delays to passengers are caused by publicly-owned Network Rail. Ownership is not the silver bullet that our politicians think it is.ldquoInstead of stating a publicly owned railway would be automatically superior, they should explain what practical measures it would take that the current operator is not. Relying on re-nationalisation as a magic cure-all risks disappointing voters and passengers.Labour MSP Colin Smyth said: ldquoIf Nicola Sturgeon was serious about nationalisation she wouldnrsquot have instructed her MSPs go vote with the Tories against Labourrsquos plans to bring ScotRail back into public ownership.Scottish Tory transport spokesman Jamie Greene added: \"Going back to the days of the curled up sandwiches and British Rail is not the solution for Scotlandrsquos railways.\"ScotRail said re-nationalisation was not a matter for it.ScotRail managing director Alex Hynes said: ldquoWersquore sorry to customers for the disruption to services in recent weeks. We know the impact this has on your day, and are working flat out to get things back to normal.AScottish Government spokeswoman said: ldquoUnique in the UK, the Scottish Government secured powers to accept bids for future rail franchises in Scotland from public sector organisations through the Scotland Act . This was after repeatedly being denied that right by successive Labour and Conservative governments.ldquoThe Scottish Government must let rail franchises in accordance with the UK Railways Act , which requires open competition as rail franchising and competition policy remain reserved to the UK Government. Network Rail is a UK public body and, although its activities in Scotland are specied and funded by the Scottish Government, it is ultimately accountable to the UK Government.ldquoFor the recently announced UK rail review to be meaningful, it must consider devolving all rail matters to the Scottish Ministers.

The word Unionist is included in the full title of their party and the historic privileges enjoyed by them and the cultural constituency they represented have all indeed flourished when Westminsterrsquos writ has run in its four constituent parts.This is not to say that they are anything less than fully Scottish, just that they believe Scotlandrsquos destiny to be forever entwined with the UK. Itrsquos merely one among many declarations of what it means to be Scottish and none the less valid for that and is characterised chiefly by an historic affectionnot love for what they understand Britishness to be.Thus, there was an honesty and integrity about the Scottish Toriesrsquo opposition to independence that was absent in much of the campaigning of Scottish Labour chiefs and their water-carriers on social media. This seemed to be fuelled less by any great love for the Union than by an implacable malevolence ndash sometimes approaching outright hatred ndash towards anything sponsored by the SNP. At times you formed an impression thatScottish independence was being proposed by wee green men emerging from a spaceship they would receive a fairer hearing in some Labour circles than anyone sporting a yellow and black rosette.The seeds of such bitterness were probably sewn in hundreds of Westminster and electoral campaigns keenly contested and with a signicant degree of rancour with the SNP. On these occasions it wasnrsquot the Tories who were threatening their influence and privileges but the SNP, even though they may have shared largely similar social agendas. Many simply couldnrsquot stomach the possibility of permitting what would be the ultimate triumph of the SNP evenit meant ignoring what their instincts were telling them: that Westminster was beginning to favour options for the rich in its economic policies and to re-direct any resultant working-class bitterness in the direction of immigrants.Even the most reactionary of Tory governments come to power on the back of working class votes. For this to occur, they must always have an assortment of familiar phantoms and usual suspects to hand and these must be leveraged by calls to national unity and security or the echoes of empire. Any notions Scottish Labour might have entertained about de-coupling from such a polity were swamped by antagonism towards the wretched SNP. They also fashioned a  narrative to conceal such narrow animosity. Thus, the lie that the referendum was nasty and isive and that Yes supporters despised the English became the distinguishing feature of their campaign.It was probably this, as much as anything , that formed the tipping point for many Labour supporters who, having signalled their rejection of such a dishonest narrative, were subsequently marginalised and made to feel like aliens in their own party. None of them have since ed to the Labour fold and this, more than anything  is why Labour in Scotland is a spent force with no immediate prospect of recovery.Foolishly, Richard Leonard, Labourrsquos latest leader in Scotland, continues to oppose independence while exhibiting no shred of original thinking on policy that might make his party attractive once more to the tens of thousands of its former supporters who have abandoned it.As Westminster takes a two-week holiday while the clock ticks towards a No-deal Brexit nothing in the behaviour of Labourrsquos UK leadership has done anything to inspire confidence either. In the last seven days Irsquove asked several Labour supporters to describe their partyrsquos Brexit strategy. No two answers were the same and all were marked by confusion. Any empathy they had previously felt with Jeremy Corbynrsquos policies on social justice has evaporated, largely on the perception that he has been found grievously wanting on this the biggest political issue of their lives. No leadership, no consistency, no courage and no conviction are the unorm verdict of Mr Corbynrsquos lamentable last two weeks at Westminster. By contrast, Theresa May, even in these her darkest dayshas displayed all of these attributes.The spectre of a No-deal Brexit now looms large and with it the real threat, which the UK Government has now admitted, of civil disorder. These and the exposure of Mr Corbynrsquos failure of leadership will test the propaganda unit of the Better Together campaign during the second referendum on Scottish independence.Once, it might have been a valid argument to insist that in a time of national crisis we must pull in the same direction. Butyou have been ignored and treated with contempt as Scotlandrsquos Government and Scotlandrsquos parliament have been in their efforts to help get a decent Brexit or even to mitigate its worst effects then such appeals are rendered worthless and hollow.In  Westminsterrsquos lurch towards reactionary and socially isive policies tipped many of us towards an independent Scotland. Such a hard right agenda also seemed to act as an accelerant for darker elements with racist agendas. More than four years later the England that many of us loved and admired is on the verge of capitulating to these forces and it looks like UK Labour has been fighting them with a peashooter.When it comes time to have our second referendum ndash and we will have it ndash there will be a moral dimension to consider for those who previously voted No and this will outweigh everything .

Democratic president Bill Clinton, after the congressional midterm drubbing for his party, was dealing with the new world order.After five days, a deal was reached to end the shutdown, but only for a few weeks so that negotiations could take place on the ious spending bills funding the government for the remainder of the fiscal year. An estimated , workers went without pay, though they would get paid retrospectively, which is the historical practice.December , -January , The Republican-led Congress and Mr Clinton were still at odds on six of that yearrsquos spending bills when the short-term fix ending the first shutdown expired. An estimated , federal workers were furloughed. They eventually agreed to spending plans that enacted some of the cuts Republicans wanted, though less than they had originally sought.Republicans took a political hit for the shutdown, which closed national parks and Smithsonian museums.Undercutting the Republicans was Mr Gingrichrsquos comment that the hard-line stance in negotiations was due in part to how Mr Clinton and aides treated him and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole on an Air Force One flight.Mr Gingrich complained that Mr Clinton did not discuss the budget on thetrip from Israel, where they had attended the funeral of Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. Mr Gingrich also complained about having to exit through a back door on the plane.October -, Republicans who controlled the House and several Republican senators targeted Democratic president Barack Obamarsquos healthcare law. Democrats who held the majority in the Senate made clear the effort was futile.Senator Ted Cruz helped inspire the effort when he spoke on the Senate floor for  hours and  minutes in urging Congress to cut off money for Mr Obamarsquos health care law.

Senator Richard Burr called it ldquothe dumbest idea Irsquove ever heard.The shutdown sent approval of the Republicans plummeting in opinion polls. Senate leaders brokered an agreement after the House was unable to coalesce around a Republican-only approach.January -, Weeks of haggling between the White House and congressional Democrats focused largely on immigration issues, with Democrats pushing for protections for ldquoDreamers who came to the US as small children. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer repeatedly complained about Mr Trump agreeing to something face-to-face and then saying or tweeting something completely dferent. Mr Schumer said dealing with Mr Trump was ldquolike negotiating with Jell-O.The shutdown lasted just short of three full days, starting on a Friday night and ending the following Monday when Democrats dropped their demands in exchange for a promise from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell that he would address the immigration issue in the coming weeks. The deal was largely unpopular among Democratic voters, who blamed their representatives for caving in too easily.February , Republican senator Rand Paul of Kentucky single-handedly triggered the shortest shutdown in history with a filibuster that forced the Senate to miss a midnight deadline to approve a spending deal that Mr Paul regarded as wasteful.As a result, the government technically ran out of money at .am that Friday.

advertised for public consultation on November  with a plan showing that the majority of streets in the town will have a mph speed restriction enforced which formerly had only been used near schools.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe new mph proposal covers most of Wick. This is a new permanent  scheme.Councillor Matthew Reiss, Thurso and Northwest Caithness, a former senior police officer with a particular interest in road safety, said: ldquoIf you have a lower speed limit, safety is improved ndash that is a fact.ldquoIf the local residents are happy with it then Irsquom very happy. With many parked cars on the streets there is always a chance of children walking out between them and not being seen. Slower cars will cut the chances of any potential accident.The civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, Wick and East Caithness, said research had shown a big reduction in collisions in built-up areas in towns and villages following the introduction of mph zones. They also improved the character of residential areas and the quality of le for residents, he added.Councillor Andrew Sinclair, Wick and East Caithness, admitted to being a bit sceptical when he first heard about the proposal. ldquoIt sounded like change for the sake of change. Whilst I have slightly warmed to the idea, I still have some concerns, he said.Councillor Sinclair thinks the vast majority of vehicles are already driving at around mph through Wick anyway.He wonders how effectively the new speed limits will be implemented with all the current pressures and priorities of the police.The scheme is being rolled out across the region with restrictions implemented for Alness, Dingwall, Invergordon and Tain. Gateway signage, roundels, mph repeater signs and speed indication devices have been introduced in all four Ross-shire towns.Some local residents commenting on social media felt it would be hard to police the speed restriction effectively.Wick man Konrad Szewczyk said: ldquoSuch nannying should be relegated to nurseries and primary schools, not entire settlements.\"A Bridge Street shopkeeper, Kevin Milkins, thought there was \"little use having laws with no-one to enforce them\", referring to a lack of policing.While one local woman who did not wish to be named said: \"They can set whatever speed limits they want but the idiots and young racers will decide their own speed.\"A council spokesperson said thatthe scheme goes through the consultation process with no objections it could be in place by March.Saturday  Dec  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118636.jpg","title":"New chief is told of local issues","story":"BUDGET cuts and decentralisation were the main topics raised by Caithness people when the new Highland Council chief executive, Donna Manson, visited Wick and Thurso.She met staff, councillors and members of the public as she listened to their concerns and issues.

That would be outrageous and, as the Committee has heard, fundamentally undermine efforts to target support where it is most needed.“Orkney has the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty at present. Unless the Minister agrees to think again ahead of Stage  consideration of this bill, that situation is unlikely to change.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The company asked Ofgem to approve the project, under a condition that, by the end of , there would be MW of generation capacity on Orkney committed to use the link once it is built.However, Ofgem has made its approval subject to SSEN demonstrating that, by no later than December , at least MW of new generation on Orkney has either been awarded a Contract for Dferencein the government#s  CfD auction or has secured planning consent and finance to construct its project.Meeting this increased generation target could prove challenging. This summer saw planning applications two large-scale wind farms, which would have contributed to this generation total, refused by Orkney Islands Council#s planning committee, following signicant public opposition.SSEN has said it #strongly disagrees# with MW of new generation being required, saying their figure of MW is based on industry best practice, which has been used to assess similar transmission investments across GB. SSEN has also said it is unclear why Ofgem is proposing a dferent test for Orkney, which it says conflicts with Ofgem’s own guidance on these types of transmission investments.Ofgem also says it plans to reduce the cost to consumers of building the link by seeking to replicate the outcomes of competition by using the #Competition Proxy# model, where it will set the revenue that SSEN can earn from building and operating the Orkney link based on its experience in cutting the costs of connecting offshore wind farms to the grid by tendering the ownership of these links.SSEN has stated concerns that the Competition Proxy model has  still not been fully developed by Ofgem, rather than the well-established Strategic Wider Works model.Ofgem has said it will make a decision on the business case for the link in spring next year and will confirm whether it will use the Competition Proxy model at the same time.Speaking on Friday, following the publication of Ofgem#s Needs Case consultation publication, David Gardner, SSEN#s director of transmission, said the recognition that the connection is needed is #a crucial step forward#, adding: “Whilst there are still several obstacles to overcome, having got this far it is important we don’t miss this opportunity to unlock Orkney’s vast renewables potential.#We will therefore continue to work in close consultation with our generation customers and wider stakeholders to address the key points raised by Ofgem in its consultation.”Ofgem has separately published a consultation on SSEN’s #Alternative Approach for Orkney# policy proposal, designed to overcome the barriers to connection faced by SSEN’s generation customers on Orkney.Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur welcomed Ofgem#s consultation but said there is still work to do to ensure SSEN#s proposals meet the needs and reflect the concerns of the local community.Aside from a transmission subsea cable from Orkney to Caithness, SSEN#s transmission reinforcement project, which, in one form or another, would stretch around most of the Orkney mainland and some of the south isles, would consist of:More information on SSEN#s Orkney Transmission Reinforcement project can be found at company#s website, here.For more on this story, see next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The first £ payment will be made around the time a child starts nursery, to help with the costs of early learning and a further £ when they start school.Social security secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “I am delighted we will be delivering the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment earlier than originally planned, providing low income families with increased financial support. I am particularly pleased, that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister, and had no support from the UK Government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.“With the Early Learning and School Age Payments, this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide £, # £, more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit. That’s a substantial investment to ensure our under s get the best possible start in le and reflects this government’s emphasis on the early years.“Our focus on supporting people on low incomes, and the action we are taking stands in stark contrast to the UK Government, who last week was criticised by the UN Poverty Rapporteur for being in denial about the damage and misery that their welfare cuts were causing.”Connie is  and lives in Glasgow her baby is five months old.“I heard about the Pregnancy and Baby Payment through One Parent Families Scotland, who told me all about the grant and how to apply for it,” she said.“The payment will go toward clothes, nappies and shoes for my son, babies grow so quickly and he’s five months now.“This will make a real dference to me, it’s not a payment I was expecting. It will make le a bit easier, my income stays the same, but my outgoings are higher as this is my third child. My other children are four and five so the things I had for them I don’t have anymore, so I’m kinda starting again.“I got the baby box which is great, but you get size - month clothes in that, so the £ would be of benefit when he’s a wee bit bigger.” vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Terence Anthony, now retired, was a primary teacher at Edinburgh’s Gylemuir Primary School when it was alleged three years ago he made physical contact by forcibly moving a pupil with behaviour problems and autism by her shoulders causing distress and insisting another pupil sat in his underwear “as punishment for speaking”.Following the verdict, Mr Anthony highlighted his view of the vague regulations relating to when a teacher can physically interact with a child.He said: “The government has to come up with some sort of rules for when a teacher can make contact with a child. Every teacher in this country has been in a situation where they’ve had to split up a fight in a playground. The number of times you intervene physically because somebody goes at somebody that looks to throw something and you stop. Do you just let it happen and live with the consequences  “I can understand the worry about teachers being too forceful with some children, but there has to be a leeway there for teachers to intervene when there is a threat.”The Scottish Government’s National Guidance for Child Protection states that physical contact with schoolchildren should be minimal.It permits for teachers to reassure upset children through physical measures, however, adding that teachers may only make contact with a child when it is the child who “initiates the contact and when it is appropriate.” In situations where a child needs to be restrained, either to protect the child their self or others, the guidance notes that minimal force should be used.What constitutes “minimal force” could be seen as debatable in dferent circumstances.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: “School staff have access to guidance on the use of physical intervention as a last resort to ensure the safety of pupils.”©JPIMedia

This is a month noted for its joie de vivre, bonhomie and what the German language, with typical economy, calls Weinachteneinkäuferwartung . It is signicant, perhaps, that the English language has no specic noun for the state of mind that settles on many of us during this special month. This state is marked by a niggling desire to get away – anywhere – in order to escape the state of mind that appears to affecting others.For some, the first appearance of Christmas lights is the signal that things are about to go downhill. In Edinburgh, this happens now in September, immediately after the Edinburgh Festival. This is in accordance with the desire of our local tourism promoters – a couthie lot – to inflict festivals on the long-suffering inhabitants of this city  , as the expression has it, and, indeed,  . For this, many feel they should be awarded  . But that is another subject, and it is too depressing to talk about it in a month during which we are all so spontaneously cheerful. The Reverend I.M. Jolly we most certainly are not.However, one feature of December that is genuinely enjoyable is the Christmas letter that people like to send their friends and relatives round about now. These are wonderful things to receive, and who does not feel a certain disappointment when they open a Christmas card and find that it contains nothing but good wishes for Christmas and the New Year  There is no point in sending others such thin fare: of course they have such wishes for you, and it would be odd,not actually hurtful,they were not to harbour such thoughts. By contrast, finding a cyclostyled letter within is a bonus, and sets the heart racing with anticipation.: Alexander McCall Smith: Edinburgh Airport should charge people to sit downAn important thing to understand about these letters is that they give an opportunity to boast, usually about one’s offspring. Usually this involves exam results, which form, on average, about half the content of a Christmas letter. When it comes to Highers and A levels and such things, people have no shame in trumpeting them loudly in the seasonal letter. Indeed, I have heard that the SQA, which controls exam results, is seriously thinking of withholding their release until December each year in order to ensure their topicality for Christmas letters. This is a helpful suggestion, although it may complicate university admission, which of course is another very fitting topic for the Christmas letter.What you should do in this respect is mention exam results indirectly. Don’t say Jane got nine As in her exams this year. That is clearly boastful and in bad taste. Rather, you should write, “Janeis still a bit worried about her university admission. I have assured her that anyone who gets nineA grades in her Advanced Highers has no need to worry, but does she listen to me  You know how children are!” Other family achievements should not be forgotten, and should all be referred to in a good Christmas letter. Once again, insert the information indirectly, as in this example: “We all went to Rome this year and had a wonderful time. The Pope looks so much younger, you know, when you see him close up. I mean, really close up, in his private study.” That conveys, in a very tactful way, the message you wish to convey. Then you might add, “We were a bit nervous of course, as this is the first time that we have had a direct experience of the beatication of a close relative . But it was such a simple, rather moving ceremony and we had a lovely dinner afterwards in a modest trattoria ...”: Alexander McCall Smith: Time to wake up and smell Europa’s coffee If you received an OBE or similar award this year, do not mention it directly. The following form of words will suffice: “We couldn’t get away in July, as planned, as I had to go down to London– just for the morning – what a bind!” If you went to the Garden Party, then the only way of conveying that information is to say something like this: “My goodness, it was a battle getting into my morning suitin July. There I was enjoying my statutory cucumber sandwich under the gaze of Arthur’s Seat, thinking of the strict diet ahead!” No more than that is necessary.All heavy colds and injuries must be mentioned. The attachment of a small photograph of an X-ray plate is optional. That, believe it or not, really was in a Christmas letter we received a few years ago. The fracture was an interesting one.

But he also reserved time for a thinly-veiled critique of the  SNP MPs at Westminster.: Would an independent Scotland face a hard border with England In conclusion to a maritime-themed analogy, in which he described Mrs May as “a barnacle clinging desperately to the hull”, Mr Salmond said: “Even the Scottish contingent seems unsure as to when, or even whether, to launch our Caledonian leboat and chart our own course for the continent.”“In fact, the only parliamentmentary group which appears secure and determined in their objectives are the Democratic Unionists. Speaking in the show’s closing monologe, Mr Salmond added: “Parliament should now take advantage of the Scottish ruling from the European Court of Justice and instruct the Government to revoke Article . This would allow the time and space for either a general election or a renewed referendum, or even just a rationale discussion to break the deadlock and chart a way forward, free from the looming clf edge. As we say in Scotland - that would make for a guid new year.”An SNP spokesman said: “The fact of the matter is this – an alternative must be found to the PM’s  choice of a bad deal which lacks support, or a bad deal which would spell disaster for jobs and living standards.“The SNP is the only party showing true leadership by knocking heads together and making the case for a better way forward.“Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in Europe. If we have the chance to do so through another EU referendum we should grasp that opportunity.“But there is no doubt whatsoever that the utter chaos of Brexit from the Tory party has strengthened the case for Scotland taking its future into its own hands through independence.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European. Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England. A separation you are keen to expand upon. I have to say you do seem confusedSo your British now,not a Shetlander, # accepting the majority wanting to be part of the E.U, So much for Wir Shetlandits Wir Westminster then!Give us a vote and I will vote with my head and my heart for Shetland to be clear of da lot a dem, EU, UK and Scotland all running massive deficits. We wid certainly be much better aff.Fake news strikes again then I guess#Which is this culture that demands you submit without question Ali   Sounds like it owes more to Henry Tudor than Kant and Rousseau. And what culture is it you are being asked to accept that separates us and is abhorrent to you   Eurovision   Persian   Mesophilic Perhaps you can expand on what your gripe actually is Ali,it isn’t pulling sovereignty with folk little dferent from ourselves.FYI should Brexiteers triumph I’d still rather separate Scotland from England and stay European as I don’t much want to be led by English nationalist bigots. No confusion there.As I said only a fool submits without question, and remaining in the eu is submitting without question.Go read the Lisbon treatyyou think it isn#t.I am intrigued as to what other opinions there is on Brexit, and whether or not this has a political agenda to suit the purpose for a particular party to benefit Is Brexit for the greater good of the few, but at the cost to the many Would Shetland be better off under Brexit   There does not appear to be a definite picture being drawn where people can make a concise and definitive choice. Even the politics which has caused this mess, seem to be at odds with each other  How do they expect the people of the countryto choose   The more you look into Brexit, the more I am convinced we would be better off on our own Maybe we should re-establish our links back to Denmark     Propaganda rules okPutting the culture issue Ali ducks aside I don’t get why pulling sovereignty when it is helpful is a problem, be that in the EU or even when accepting WTO rules which, guess what, weren’t written singlehandedly by her majesty’s government. Lisbon moved us to majority rule in a partnership of friendly nations. So what Perhaps the problem to following mutually beneficial accept-some-trade-off rules set by the collective group is where you fear your culture dfers, so again I am wondering what part of European culture Ali fears and   or rejects. Eating snails asideI’ve always felt the UK is an appreciated part of mainstream European culture. There is a joint love of family, films, bevvy and football, eating out a bitpossible, a law abiding appreciation of the need for democracy, free speech, free press etc. Fondness of folktales and music, poetry, song, literature, dance and even opera unite people across national boundaries. Again, what is Ali’s problem Leaving the EU will be bad for jobs, farming and the NHS and we don’t know what the deals will bring to fishing or trade. Vive la dference and long live the similarities. I think your own bigotry is shinning through Peter, You talk about pooling sovereignty on one hand while labeling the English bigots. You say one thing while meaning another will you be standing for office soon A few thoughts, not for the first time have we, in Britain, find ourselves alone with Europe united against us and the will of our people. Not for the first time in our history has our position looked bleak with hard times being promised to come. We are being bullied by a cabal of bureaucratic nonentities answerable to no one who would try and isolate and distance us from our Commonwealth friends. Our Sovereignty and independence being undermined and the will of our people being ignored and denigrated. Contrary to some misinformed views, I and many like me, welcome selective immigration from Europe but not at the expense of our Commonwealth friends, whatever their colour and Creed. I welcome open Borders in Ireland just as they were long before the EU ever existed.We have stood alone before and always overcome adversity however grave. IfJunker and the cabal running the EU will not negotiate and remain intransigent, sneering and neo-bellicose It is time to stand tall and give them the two-finger salute, not just the Churchilian one.Heavens Ian, I wis imagining a violin accompaniment.We cant feed our bairns sovereignty Ian, even the Bank of England agrees that we are going to be worse off.A self-made economic disaster.Let them eat cake.Really Ian, “bullied”   Surely Theresa May said her deal was a “good deal”.There is such a thing as reading too manyeditorials. Last one I read saw Ian’s “bureaucratic nonentities” blasted for removing the right of the honest Brit to buy a lawnmower so loud it could deafen you. How very dare the EU protect UK consumers Does Ian imagine Claude Junker doesn’t speak for the elected leaders of the remaining EU nation states, but that rather they march to his tune  Lamentable.The remain member states are naturally protecting the interests of their citizens, including those of the Republic of Ireland, who are in the worlds largest trading block, which is conveniently on our doorstep.The Commonwealth ties however are lose, with distant nations who urged Britain to Remain. The EU block will secure better trade deals with those nations faster by dint of size and relevance.British diplomacy has never succeeded by cutting off our nose to spite our face.Perhaps we should learn from the Nordic foreign minister who quipped last week that there are two types of countries in Europe: small ones and small ones that don’t realise they are small.Has the question really been answered as to why the Tories, gave us this referendum to leave the EU in the first place,it was not going to be in their favour, despite the fact much of our business is with the EU What hidden agenda do the Tories have that they are not telling us###..until it is too late Have we all become xenophobic and argumentive about the pro#s and con#s of the EU, and the need to # fly the flag # as a weak demonstration of nationalityor Britishness, said very, very loosely   It seems very much we are playing right into the hands of the Tories, and singing their song to their beat.What has brought this on other than a narrow vision and not looking at the bigger picture    Brexit only means one thing, and this one thing is for the Tories to benefit for themselves no matter how you look at it.I would prefer to be as part of the EU, instead of being outside it, looking in.It is as simple as that.Of come off it Ali! I have never once labelled all English people as being bigots, nor would I. English nationalist bigots are bigots by definition of being bigots. It’s a bit like a numpty being a numptythat helps.Great attempt at ersion Ali, but just what, or should it be which, is your “abhorrent” cultural problem exactly  It can’t be this hard to specy the culture s you abhore surely, be they mainland, Scottish, UK mainland, continental or from further afield No man is an island Ali, unless perhaps you moved a little northwards and changed your name to Forvik, but you might need to borrow a little cash from somewhere at that stage to build a hospital lest you ever get poorly. Heaven knows who would staff it though, when you are happy to say some cultures are abhorrent to you but won’t specy which.Last I checked you can’t train as a doctor at Shetland College, the NAFC or in a night class in Hamnavoe or Walls, so I guess we will be needing other folk from other parts and other cultures for some time to come. Maybe try to get over it Mr. Shetland-wid-be-much-better-aff-clear-of-da-lot-of-dem, EU-UK-and-Scotland.I do not know exactly what it is Peter, but your first paragraph reminds me of ##.. Is not worth noticing. lolHo ho ho! Glad you are laughing David 🙂I’m with you on the real agenda behind Brexit not being immediately obvious btw.I think the big picture is that there are some rich and powerful people in the UK wanting to shackle the UK to USA workers rights and health care in order to benefit from lower taxes after Brexit.They don’t need the EU to guarantee their human rights. They have holidays aplenty and investments in so many places that using the NHS is as alien to them as using public transport.They have uncharitably driven their agenda to the fore against the better instincts of one nation Tories and have done so using decades of media manipulation and dispicable xenophobic dog whistle messages on immigration.Thankfully as I write the Shaddow Home Secretary is advocating for an “efficient, fair and non-discriminatory migration policy” that is conducive to the UK’s economic interests. Something to wish for in the New Year.I take your points, Peter. It will be interesting how the Tories will drive their immigration policies and whether or not it bends more towards the USA than to this of the EU, after March next year One of the largest industries which depend on EU workers is in the hospitality industry, even here in Shetland there is a large EU workforce, not only in the hospitality industry, but the fishing processing industry as well.It will be interesting how the Shetland economy will cope after March .As for human rights, I question the validity of as to what will be used and what will be discarded in terms of either British or European Human Rights. I fear workers rights may be diminished and favoured more towards the employer than the employee     We shall see If the UK becomes # the cheap workforce of Europe # this may stir up resentment within the working ethos or political change##.before it is too late    We are in unchartered waters, and there could be stormy sea#s ahead.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-visitorthebest-360px_Page_4.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly.

This includes parents with pushchairs, children who cannot manage the whole route and entrants who have mobility limitations.Event organisers have said that the sections that are alternatives to the main route, will not be marshalled, so caution will need to be exercised when crossing roads.All proceeds from the participants taking part in the main route will go towards the Rotary Club of the Isle of Skye, while proceeds from the alternative route entrants will go towards the West Highland College restricted mobility fitness course.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8746825.1545316039!/image/image.jpg","title":"duffin replacement selected by sdlp","story":"The SDLP has co-opted Ryan Wilson onto Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council.Mr Wilson will take up the vacant seat in the Dunsilly DEA.It had been vacant since former SDLP representative, Brian Duffin, resigned from the local authority after losing an appeal against a sexual assault conviction.Mr Wilson said: “I am delighted to have been co-opted to serve the people of Randalstown, Toome, Creggan and Parkgate, in what is an increasingly challenging time in politics. “Alongside my colleagues in council, I intend to make rural job creation a focus during my tenure, as well as lobbying for more social housing to be built in South Antrim. “Additionally, I will work to secure adequate funding for many excellent community, charitable and sporting organisations throughout the constituency.”Welcoming Mr Wilson to the role, party leader Colum Eastwood MLA said: “Ryan has proven to be a dedicated activist within the party and his local community.

Romance is sort of put to the side. I hadn’t a clue this was coming. Leannes four-year-old daughter Quinn was there to witness the romantic moment on Sunday“We had our gym party on Saturday night. The idea was to go up the big wheel first then go to the party and be able to tell everyone, celebrate with them and show them the ring.“Because of the weather warning, rather than wait, he went for plan B.”At the Templeton they were taken to a reserved table decorated with crystals where staff brought out drinks and a plate with ‘Marry Me ’ written on it in chocolate.Leanne said: “Then he got down on one knee and gave me the ring. It was really romantic. I was crying my eyes out. Then he told me what I could have won.”She added: “At least we got a second go at it.

It is this trip that has him in the full glare of publicity once again due to the Spotlight investigation. Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role. He said: “No. Nothing at all. I mean that was a genuine mistake on my part, I made a mistake and I apologised for it and I was punished for it.The matter will now be referred back to the Parliamentary Standards Commission, where the allegations will be further scrutinised.

My sacrice and dedication went to motorcycling and I’m very proud to be a Doctor of Letters because of that.“It’s a lelong sacrice. Since I was six-years-old I’ve travelled theand breadth of the UK racing. The injuries I’ve faced, the ups and downs, to actually win a world championship on top of all that is massive.“It’s nice that my family can see there was an endgame after all their sacrice in the beginning.Jonathan Rea shows off his new threads“It’s a very proud day for the whole family. Especially my two little boys , they realise that it’s not normal to be at an event like this. They know the ious race tracks inside out but this is dferent. I hope I can be a good role model for them.”The -year-old said it was the first time he had ever attended a graduation, adding: “I never imagined the first one would be my own.”Asked about his graduate attire for the ceremony, he said: “Of course I feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it’s really nice to be acknowledged outside the sport. It’s something that’s happening more and more recently.”The honorary degree follows the  award of an MBE on the New Year’s Honours list. Rea also finished runner up in the  BBC Sports Personality of the Year. Jonathan Rea with his honorary degree from the University of Ulster at Belfasts Waterfront Hall“These others awards and occasions are new to me. It’s good that I have the support at home and actually moving back here is great timing.”Underneath his gown he was wearing a suit made by Isle of Man-based tailor The Noble Suitor. It was embroidered inside to read: ‘Made exclusively for Dr Jonathan Rea MBE’.The former Ballynure Primary School and Larne Grammar pupil said: “I’ve been back a few times to assemblies and to talk to the kids.

Jonathan Reas specially made suit for the ceremony“My grades at GCSE were A*s, As and Bs, but unfortunately I didn’t further that. I went travelling the world racing bikes.“After I left school I went to technical college and got an HNC in manufacturing engineering and then went on to work as an engineer.“It was hard to hold down a job as I was taking too much time off work to go racing.“I had what was nearly a career-ending injury. That was a dark time in my le because I didn’t know what was coming, I’d no great qualications behind me, I was working a minimum wage job. I wasn’t in a great state of mind.“I threw myself at bikes for a few years and then it worked out, my big break came.”He added: “Northern Ireland fans are very important to me. The travelling support has been immense these last few years. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.“On my sighting laps and slow down laps I can see the Northern Ireland fans. I always try to throw out a leg to acknowledge I’ve seen them.”Rea is often claimed by both Larne and Ballyclare and sometimes referred to as a son of Ballymena. Asked where he came from, he said: “I’m a country boy. I grew up in Kilwaughter, then moved to Ballyboley. We were part of Larne Council with a Ballymena area code and a Ballyclare postcode. I’m happy to be claimed by whoever.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8741643.1545039707!/image/image.jpg","title":"health  ","story":"Age NI says a recently launched Department of Health review of emergency health care # with a particular focus on pensioners # is #a bit late in the day# for this winter and #should have started months ago#.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit republic and eus plans for nodeal proof backstop is trap says dodds","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There are detailed plans for a wide raft of sectors. But it totally avoids spelling out what happens on the border. What does that tell you \"Even in the event of a so-called no-deal scenario a hard border wont happen.\"The notion that its necessary to have a border and checks in the Irish Sea to avoid a border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic is an utter con trick.\"Even the Dublin authorities in its no-deal plans admitted no checks on goods at the border.\"Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the border was not addressed in his Governments contingency plan in the event of a no-deal Brexit because the backstop was the only solution.\"For us to be giving signals that theres any other way this could be solved would be foolish,\" he added.Mr Coveney reiterated that in the absence of a backstop and a Brexit deal, preventing physical border infrastructure in Ireland would be \"dficult and involve hard choices\".But he said it would not be helpful for a document, which runs to more than  pages, to be \"dominated by that border debate\".Speaking yesterday, the Taoiseach said the draft agreement currently tabled by Prime Minister Theresa May was the key to avoiding physical infrastructure on the border.\"We are not preparing for a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland,\" Mr Varadkar said.\"We have made no preparations whatsoever for physical infrastructure or anything like that.\"We certainly do not want it to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\"The Irish Government has unveiled contingency plans to cope with a potential no-deal Brexit, identying affected sectors which would require up to between  and  pieces of new legislation.The no-deal plans include the purchase of land at ports to prevent congestion from new customs.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the \"robust action by the Irish Government is a stark indication of the serious chaos ahead\".\"This action rightly highlights that the island of Ireland will be disproportionately impacted by Brexit, leaving Northern Ireland sharing a land border with another EU state despite myths peddled by Brexiteers, this leaves Ireland in a very precarious position,\" he said.\"These plans, in contrast to the weak technical papers issued by the British Government and the absence of any action from Stormont, at least acknowledge the state of affairs as they are. \"But regardless of where we are post-March , the backstop must be in place to protect the future interests of people here.\"Ulster Unionist MLA Steve Aiken said it was not surprising Dublin had produced the plan. \"We are rapidly hurtling towards a no-deal Brexit and such an outcome would be felt just as acutely in many sectors of the Republic as it would here,\" he said.\"For the last two-and-a-half years the negotiators on both sides have brought us to this ridiculous situation and as a result were now less than  days from an economic precipice. Every preparatory step that can be taken must now be taken.\"Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said the warning signs were there that no-deal would be an \"economic disaster\" and there was now growing concern in the business community.\"The Prime Ministers draft withdrawal deal is in no way perfect, but it is definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal,\" he said.\"Those who oppose it have not set out a viable plan B. MPs need to back this dea, or we face the prospect of economic instability.\"Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle ONeill has told Secretary of State Karen Bradley that the Westminster Brexit debate \"has descended into farce and pantomime\"."},{"url":null,"title":"dups emma pengelly reminds academic she has arts degree from ulster university","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Labour will try to force Brexit vote before Christmas  Bertie Ahern: Ireland cant give an inch on avoiding hard border  Blair: May is irresponsible to try and steamroller her deal through The routes are understood to include country lanes, private roads, rights of way across private lands and other unmarked access points leading into Northern Ireland that could be potential smuggling routes.The highly sensitive work was conducted by members of the Defence Forces, working with gardai. It involved physical mapping of the Border by army personnel along with desk-top work and was completed in recent months.Defence Forces are in continual mapping of Irelands Border for security purposes, such as during the Foot  Mouth disease outbreak  years ago The latest exercise is regarded as particularly signicant in light of the potential security risks posed by Brexit.The updated map of the frontier will form a key part of the security services contingency planning for a doomsday scenario that could follow Britain plunging out of the EU without a deal.The last official report on the Border identied  official crossing points. That report was published jointly in July by the Department of Transport, Tourism  Sport and the Department of Infrastructure in Northern Ireland.However, it highlighted only public roadways along the Border that stretches from Donegal to Antrim and did not include any private roads or laneways.The Defence Forces work has highlighted scores of private crossing points, some of which could be vulnerable to criminality in the event of a hard border. The Irish Armys Border mapping work can be viewed in the context of the security risks posed by Brexit, which were outlined in stark detail at a cross-border crime conference last month.Garda Commissioner Drew Harris told the conference that dissidents would \"undoubtedly\" attempt to exploit a hard border as \"something they wish to rally around\".\" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks But the conference was also warned that even a soft Brexit could lead to challenges with increases in cross-border smuggling of all kinds, including people trafficking, cigarette and alcohol smuggling and fuel laundering. The conference was told that pc of cross-border gangs are highly mobile and operate on both sides of the Border.Previous security assessments have identied  criminal gangs dominating cigarette smuggling on both sides of the Border. The Governments position is that there must be noto a hard border.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said earlier this month that the Government has no contingency plans in place for policing the Border in the event of a hard Brexit.However, he said the Government does \"have regard for the fact that we could see an increase in smuggling and other illegal cross-border activities\".In a statement to the Sunday Independent, the Defence Forces said: \"In the normal course, Oglaigh na hEireann carry out analysis and background research into contingencies. This would include viable border crossings. In the context of security, any research in relation to the border or otherwise is internal to Oglaigh na hEireann.\"A statement from An Garda Siochana this weekend said they \"have been and will continue to review the policing issues relating to Brexit. This has included regular liaison with our counterparts in Northern Ireland. However, without a final political settlement, it is not yet clear what the specic impacts on policing will be.\"\"Regardless of the final political settlement, our long-standing strong working relationship with the PSNI will continue in order to protect and support communities.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37650155.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/image__9_.jpg","title":"lego titanic twoyear project almost done as keith builds","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But it went to the bottom of the North Atlantic in April  after striking an iceberg on its maiden voyage to New York.More than , passengers and crew perished.Mr Morton got the idea from a child in America who made a Titanic model. His father and older brother were both sailors, so he has always felt a connection to the sea.Using smaller bricks than the youngsters model, he feels his looks more realistic. The Lego he used was sourced from second-hand websites BrickOwl and BrickLink due to price.

And after he put a window in on the starboard side and built up the back of the vessel, he realised he had made an error.\"I pulled my hair out a wee bit. I didnt want to pull it all down but it took me around two months to sort it out,\" he said.During his Titanic venture he also put in a kitchen and built an extension to his house, which he said was why the replica took so long to make. He also had to control the eager hands of partner Karen Birchs  grandchildren, aged three to .He joked: \"If they would have touched it, I would have strangled them. No, on a serious note, theyre of an age to realise and yes they have knocked a couple of little bricks off it, but nothing untoward.\"Mr Morton has seen Titanic artefacts at the Merseyside Maritime Museum as well as Titanic: The Artefact Exhibition in Florida, but has yet to visit the Belfast museum.There are around  small bricks left to fit before the model is complete, but Mr Morton is already thinking about making the Flying Scotsman next."},{"url":null,"title":"man quizzed over harassment letters sent to staff at northern ireland school","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ever since then people from this area have been working for peace.“I see the ride as being a way to help spread that message of peace.”The event will start with a walk up Burnswark with local artists and representatives from Allanton World Peace Sanctuary.Jan Hogarth, an environmental artist working with others on the events, said: “By carrying the Lockerbie Standard on a white horse from Tundergarth to the atmospheric local landmark of Burnswark, Krystal will symbolise the love and compassion with which these communities responded to a tragedy that affected so many families and countries.“In the decades since the bombing the people of this area have shown people kindness and compassion.“These events build on that positive process, bringing together people of all generations and of many backgrounds and beliefs with the common goal of spreading a message of peace and hope on earth.”The walk will be led by Professor David Munro, geographer in residence at Drumlanrig Castle.He said: “In our more troubled times the landscape has a capacity to embrace us and reach into our inner souls, helping us to make sense of the world we live in.“It nourishes our hearts and minds, offering us a genuine hope of peace.”"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say december","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Democratic president Bill Clinton, after the congressional midterm drubbing for his party, was dealing with the new world order.Emboldened Republicans were intent on remaking Medicare, Medicaid, welfare and dozens of other programmes while also cutting taxes. Mr Clinton vetoed a resolution to temporarily fund the government because of the Medicare premium increases it contained.After five days, a deal was reached to end the shutdown, but only for a few weeks so that negotiations could take place on the ious spending bills funding the government for the remainder of the fiscal year. An estimated , workers went without pay, though they would get paid retrospectively, which is the historical practice.Shutdown round two and plane snubDecember , -January , The Republican-led Congress and Mr Clinton were still at odds on six of that year’s spending bills when the short-term fix ending the first shutdown expired. An estimated , federal workers were furloughed. They eventually agreed to spending plans that enacted some of the cuts Republicans wanted, though less than they had originally sought.Republicans took a political hit for the shutdown, which closed national parks and Smithsonian museums.Undercutting the Republicans was Mr Gingrich’s comment that the hard-line stance in negotiations was due in part to how Mr Clinton and aides treated him and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole on an Air Force One flight. Mr Gingrich complained that Mr Clinton did not discuss the budget on thetrip from Israel, where they had attended the funeral of Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. Mr Gingrich also complained about having to exit through a back door on the plane.Green Eggs And HamOctober -, Republicans who controlled the House and several Republican senators targeted Democratic president Barack Obama’s healthcare law. Democrats who held the majority in the Senate made clear the effort was futile.The shutdown was sparked when House Republicans insisted that a temporary funding bill contain changes in the health law, the Affordable Care Act, and Mr Obama refused.Senator Ted Cruz helped inspire the effort when he spoke on the Senate floor for  hours and  minutes in urging Congress to cut off money for Mr Obama’s health care law. To fill some of the hours — and provide a bedtime story for his two young daughters — Mr Cruz read Dr Seuss’s book Green Eggs And Ham. But even some Republicans thought the effort was a mistake. Senator Richard Burr called it “the dumbest idea I’ve ever heard”.The shutdown sent approval of the Republicans plummeting in opinion polls. Senate leaders brokered an agreement after the House was unable to coalesce around a Republican-only approach.Negotiating with Jell-OJanuary -, \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Chuck Schumer complained about Donald Trump agreeing to something in person then tweeting something dferent Weeks of haggling between the White House and congressional Democrats focused largely on immigration issues, with Democrats pushing for protections for “Dreamers” who came to the US as small children. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer repeatedly complained about Mr Trump agreeing to something face-to-face and then saying or tweeting something completely dferent. Mr Schumer said dealing with Mr Trump was “like negotiating with Jell-O”.The shutdown lasted just short of three full days, starting on a Friday night and ending the following Monday when Democrats dropped their demands in exchange for a promise from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell that he would address the immigration issue in the coming weeks. The deal was largely unpopular among Democratic voters, who blamed their representatives for caving in too easily.One-man shutdownFebruary , Republican senator Rand Paul of Kentucky single-handedly triggered the shortest shutdown in history with a filibuster that forced the Senate to miss a midnight deadline to approve a spending deal that Mr Paul regarded as wasteful. As a result, the government technically ran out of money at .am that Friday. But Congress members worked through the night and approved the bill at roughly .am the same day, allowing the government tonormally with no interruptions."},{"url":null,"title":"taliban welcomes partial us withdrawal from afghanistan","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The US and Nato retreated into a training and advising role.Bill Roggio, an Afghanistan analyst with the US-based Foundation for Defence of Democracies, said: “A complete withdrawal of US forces would very likely cause the Taliban to make gains in key areas throughout Afghanistan.“This likely would cause the general collapse of theas a cohesive fighting force and lead to theof the warlords.”But the Taliban said the withdrawal could in fact assist peace efforts by helping to build trust.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  President Donald Trump considers the war in Afghanistan a lost cause and has long pushed to pull the troops out. His decision was made public a mere few hours after he abruptly announced the US was withdrawing troops from Syria.Mr Trump’s state of mind is sure to have given a sense of urgency to US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who has been working to reach a negotiated end to America’s longest war and has been pushing for a deal by April.In an interview with Afghanistan’s TOLO TV on Thursday – hours before the withdrawal plans were announced – he noted Mr Trump had campaigned for president on a promise to end the Afghan war, which has already cost Americans nearly  trillion US dollars. More than , American soldiers have died in Afghanistan since the  invasion.A Taliban official said the announcement is a positive step which could “lead to trust building that the US wants a political solution”.But there is no sign the Taliban are ready to move on the two major sticking points: Direct talks with the Afghan government and a ceasefire while the two sides negotiate Mr Khalilzad’s so-called “roadmap for the future of Afghanistan”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Zalmay Khalilzad has been trying to reach a peace settlement in Afghanistan Peace talks aside, the announced withdrawal has Afghan generals and analysts worried about the ability of the beleaguered Afghan National Afghan Security Force to stave off a Taliban insurgency unfettered by US troops and their pounding air power.The Taliban are already stronger today than they have been since they were ousted in , controlling or holding sway over nearly half the country.Several high ranking Afghan military officials said the morale of Afghanistan’s under-trained and poorly equipped security forces is already at a dangerously low ebb. The troops routinely complain about reinforcements that arrive too late, equipment that fails and even running out of food.The officials called America’s withdrawal a defeat, comparing it to the US evacuation from Vietnam and Russia’s  forced withdrawal from Afghanistan that capped a failed -year campaign."},{"url":null,"title":"derry couple give christmas gift nurses helped save twin babies lives","story":"Two little Derry twins have delivered an early Christmas present for the nurses who helped to save their lives.Saorlaith and Saoirse McLaughlin spent the first few weeks of their lives at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit .The girls were born six weeks prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication called \"Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome,\" where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.Their parents, Bob and Michelle, have since raised a staggering £, for the unit, with the help of their friends and work colleagues.This year alone, they raised over £, through a tattoo fun day and a sponsored walk.But the McLaughlin’s decided that as well as vital equipment for the ward they wanted some of the money to be spent on the nurses, who work so tirelessly for the tiny babies in their care.“This year we wanted to put a bit of focus on the nurses and let them know we appreciate everything they do for sick new borns in Derry and beyond and especially our own twin girls,” explained Bob.“We asked the nurses to give us a list of stuff they needed for their tea room and of course we added a few extras and we are also going to buy them a new three seater sofa.“We felt it was very important that the nurses should have everything they need to make decent food.“It’s not a lot but it will make a dference to them.”“We want them to know that people are thinking of them and appreciate what they do.“The NHS canteen is closed when they are on night sht and at the minute I think all they have is a

a set of knives, a radio and a £ MS voucher.And next month, they will present a cheque for the remaining £, to be spent on frontline services at the unit.“It was fantastic to catch up with some of the lovely nurses who did so much for our girls Cathy McClafferty Bridgeen Devine and Ciara Doherty and they passed on their thanks for the generosity of the public“We’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who made this possible including Michael Kelly who held a fundraiser at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park in the twins’ honour.”The tattoo fun day and last weekend’s sponsored walk have raised over £,, which will be donated to the unit next month.Mr McLaughlin says his employers and colleagues at First Source have played a huge part in helping them raise the £, over the past three years.“The management have been so supportive,” he continued.“They pick their own charity every year, but they also help a lot of smaller charities and a lot of it goes under the radar because they don’t advertise it.“When I brought my sponsorship form for the walk into work I raised £, in just five hours.“That’s how generous people in First Source are, there were people donating £ and

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said. I am delighted that this funding gives us the potential for its restoration and that future generations will also be able to enjoy the facility and engage with its heritage, he added.The local authority is keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the Walled Garden area designed to provide access via lt to its upper floor, with the local council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.Politicians were told last week that architects have been awarded the tender for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard and Rhododendron Wood areas, with work underway on planning and statutory approvals for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard.It has also been confirmed that a topographical survey mdash which could cost as much as pound, mdashwill be required to assist with the planning process.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.It is envisaged that initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the critically acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood.A critical look has also been taken of the parkrsquos traffic management and parking facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£700k environment scheme set to begin  ","story":"WORK on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick starts on January .The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the initiative which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the scheme to facilitate the contractor.The government department is making a pound, contribution to the public realm project, with the local authority providing the remainder of the cash for the eagerly-awaited revamp.Design proposals have revealed the work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year.The government department said funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.Local council officials are delighted to be working in partnership with the Department for Communities to deliver the project and are looking forward to the benefits that it will bring to Irish Street in terms of regenerating a central part of the town which has missed out on major public sector investment for several decades.Damian Mulholland mdash director of regional development with the Department for Communities mdash said recently that funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.He said the latest investment for Irish Street will enhance the natural heritage of the area at this historic part of the town and help improve visitors and resident experience.Councillor Dermot Curran says he is pleased work will start early in the New Year and has appealed to motorists to be patient during the lane closure.ldquoI realise this will inevitably have an impact on traffic, but hope roads officials will alter the sequencing of town centre traffic lights in a bid to minimise this, he continued. ldquoI hope the lane closure will be in place for the shortest time possible and will be liaising with contractors throughout the duration of the scheme.Cllr Curran said the scheme will help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents and help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment.He continued: ldquoBusiness owners in particular will be delighted that work is due to start soon. As I have said previously, Irish Street is ripe for redevelopment opportunities and this major investment is long overdue.Cllr Curran is also hopeful that Newry, Mourne and Down Council will make a fresh bid for Heritage Lottery Funding to help restore historic buildings within Downpatrickrsquos conservation area, which includes Irish Street.Several weeks ago it was confirmed that the local authorityrsquos initial bid for a so-called townscape initiative had been rejected, despite a signicant amount of time, effort and money being invested in the application process.Officials in charge of the heritage fund claimed the local authorityrsquos bid was influenced by planned regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area ldquorather than heritage need.In addition, they argued there was limited scope within Downpatrickrsquos townscape initiative area to deliver a ldquocomprehensive scheme and believed that given development proposals for Irish Street and the townrsquos former police base, the local authorityrsquos proposed scheme was ldquoinfluenced by regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area.Cllr Curran says he hopes a fresh application will meet with success to assist further the social and economic regeneration of not only Irish Street, but the wider town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch fete Schmidt  ","story":"IRELAND coach Joe Schmidt was the guest of honour at Ballymacarn Park on Friday when  members and guests enjoyed an excellent lunch followed by a question and answer session, conducted by club chairman Philip Gregg.He was his usual humble self as he described his coaching philosophy and the journey he has been on over the past  years and it was a wonderful afternoon for all in attendance.Despite his tight time schedule, Joe took the time to mingle with those present and was a complete gentleman throughout.

It has also a topic of considerable concern and a high profile environmental issue.Members of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee were told on Monday night that flytipping places a ldquosignicant demand on the organisationrsquos budget with staff also erted away from other duties to deal with the problem.Council officials are currently working alongside Environment Agency staff and neighbouring local authorities in what is being described as an attempt to ldquoadopt compatible practices and approaches to highlight the issue and reduce the scale of the problem.If the amount of the waste dumped mdash mostly in secluded areas mdash is greater than two cubic metres, or is hazardous, the incident is reported to the government agency. Council enforcement officers will also investigate each incident and assessthe culprits can be identied and prosecuted.On Monday night, councillors were told that over the past eight months there have been almost  reported fly tipping incidents across the district.Council staff responded to  incidents, with contractors removing waste on  occasions. Environment Agency staff removed waste on  occasions.While the cost of removing waste over the past eight months is estimated at almost pound,, council officials have suggested the yearly total could top the pound, mark.The cost of flytipping on hard pressed ratepayers comes just a few weeks after council officials were asked to look at innovative ways of combating the problem.Councillors are concerned about the scale of the issue and the restrictions being placed on what material ratepayers can dump at household recycling centres.Some elected representatives have suggested council officials should reintroduce a service used by the former Down Council which arranged for a local authority bin lorry to visit some towns and villages on a Saturday morning to allow people to get rid of their household waste.The scheme proved extremely popular and while it was in service there were few reported flytipping incidents in the area.In addition, community groups helped keep their respective towns and villages clean by taking part in litter picks, with their efforts recognised by the local authority via an awards scheme.Councillors also believe the fact that some of the districtrsquos household recycling centres do not accept certain types of waste is contributing to the scale of the flytipping issue which, they say, must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 19%2C 1978  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash Fears that Newcastlersquos status as a leboat base could be thrown on the rocks were sunk yesterday by the Royal National Leboat Institutionrsquos chief spokesman in Ireland, Lt-Col Brian Clark.In a clear-cut statement he dashed the hopes of  Kilkeel fishermen who have called for a full-scale rescue centre to be set up in their port instead of Newcastle.Lt-Col Clark, who is the RNLIrsquos organising secretary for all of Ireland, has also hit out strongly at claims that the prospect of a tug-orsquo-war situation is looming between Newcastle and Kilkeel.He said: ldquoKilkeel has indeed been considered carefully as a possible location for a leboat, but the major requirement is that a boat must be able to get away from its base promptly in all kinds of weather.ldquoThe RNLI management committee feels that this capability is at present lacking in the case of Kilkeel where strong winds create unfavourable conditions at the entrance to the new harbour. These conditions could prevent a leboat from ing to its moorings and may prevent it from getting out of the harbour on service.Lord Roden, the honorary secretary of the Newcastle leboat station, has also rejected the latest call to switch the leboat base from his town to Kilkeel.ldquoI can give an assurance that Newcastle is taking no part in such an argument, he said. ldquoThe stationing of boats on the coast is solely a matter for the RNLI management committee.ldquoThe Newcastle leboatmen are proud of their boat.

Owner, Patsy Tweedie, of Mullamore Drive, thinks he is dead.Teddy, who featured on the Recorderrsquos front page in February, hasnrsquot been around his home for over two weeks and this makes Mr Tweedie almost certain he is dead.ldquoTeddy had been running around with a bitch recently and came him peppered with pellets just before he disappeared, Mr Tweedie said. ldquoThat makes me believe he has been shot by some farmer who thought he was worrying sheep.ldquoIf that is the case I feel the farmer has made a mistake. Teddy wouldnrsquot worry sheep. He was far more interested in carrying my sonrsquos bag home from school and things like that. He was well known in the village and senior citizens were often thankful to have him around as a sort of watch dog.Mr Tweedie said there had been several cases of sheep worrying in the district recently and thatrsquos what led him to believe that a farmer may have shot him.He added: ldquoWe certainly miss him. One way or another, I would be interested to hear from anyone who saw him recently.KILLYLEAGH mdash Mr David Watson thought he had fought his last battle with the end of World War  mdash but he was wrong.

Because of ill health, she has to crawl up to her bedroom on hands and knees and get back down on hands and knees.Spearheading the Watsonsrsquo case has been their daughter, Mrs Jean Cheevers, and after a long struggle she has finally managed to get good news for her parents.After bringing her case to the attention of the local MP, Mr Enoch Powell, Mr Gerry Fitt MP, Cllr Rowan-Hamilton, the Sunday News and the Down Recorder, she has at last evoked a reaction from the Housing Executive.The Executive has now decided to take a ldquohumanitarian attitude to the couplersquos case, therefore increasing their chances of getting a stair-free home.In a sympathetic letter to Mrs Cheevers, an Executive spokesman explained that full consideration had been given to the age and state of health of Mr and Mrs Watson.ldquoI should add that our ability to rehouse your parents in accommodation suitable to their needs will be dependent on such accommodation becoming available in the area, the spokesman added.DOWNPATRICK mdash A bumper medieval pageant proposed for Downpatrick in May to celebrate St Patrick is hanging in the balance mdash and only a large turnout at a public meeting early in the New Year can save it from the chop.The pageant, the brainchild of Down Councilrsquos arts committee, is seen to be one of the best ideas to come out of the district for some time mdash but unless sufficient backing is forthcoming, then the community festival will have to be scrubbed.Organisers have been guaranteed funds from Down Council, but in order to quality for a big payout by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board will have to have the potential to be a major tourist attraction and to be continued each year.Mr Frank Connolly, a spokesman for the arts committee told the Recorder: ldquoIf there is no support, there will be no festival, itrsquos as simple as that. Wersquore calling a public meeting for January  in the new library in Downpatrick and itrsquos essential that there is a massive turnout of interested people and of organisations who are willing to play a part.ldquoA successful event would no doubt help tourism and itrsquos in the interest of the district to give it their full support.BALLYGOWAN mdash A young handicapped Ballygowan boy received an extra Christmas surprise recently when his pet donkey gave birth to a baby foal.Seven year-old Gregory Townley suffers from spina bida but the new addition to the family is certain to add an extra sparkle to Christmas for him.His mother, Mrs Myrtle Townley, said: ldquoMy husband got a donkey for Gregory two years ago after he bought a motorbike for my nine year-old son Roy.

When the borders came down there was a great sense of freedom, he said.He painted a bleak picture for farmers and industry stating that the UK have half of the European flock of ewes and that there was ldquono other market for sheep farmers and that a no deal Brexit would see the industry ldquofall off a clf.Father Joe McVeigh told the meeting that he was ldquovery concerned about the potential impact that Brexit would have on people on the Border. He said he did not want to see a ldquo to the bad old days of checkpoints.Councillor Alex Baird, UUP, stated that he had voted remain in the referendum but said he found there was a ldquopolitical connotation to the Border Communities Against Brexit group and that as a unionist he felt that there had been a ldquoparty political element brought in to the discussion by the lobby group.Councillor Raymond Farrell commented that ldquohe was no fan of the EU and quoted Pope Francis in saying that ldquothe EU was in danger of losing direction. He asked Mr. Sheridan how sending poundm to Europe a week and getting just over poundm back was ldquogood economics.Mr. Sheridan replied by saying ldquowe could argue about figures all day but that it was ldquoa fact that Northern Ireland received pound. for every pound that went out.

The European Commission has set out plans for  areas most likely to be impactedthe UK leaves the bloc without a deal, but the Irish border was notably absent from the list.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said his government has made no preparations whatsoever for a hard borderDublin has also published a -page ‘Getting Ireland Brexit Ready’ document outlining back up plans for almost  sectors.But again, crucially, the dossier made no mention of how the Republic plans to address the Irish border issue post-Brexit.The paper says the government’s main focus is to prevent the emergence of a hard border on the island of Ireland, though it does not specy how that will be preventedthe prime minister’s withdrawal agreement is rejected by Parliament.DUP Westminster leader Mr Dodds said the fact that the border issue had been omitted from the plans demonstrated that, in the event of a no-deal scenario, a hard border will not come to pass.His remarks came hours before Irish Premier Leo Varadkar said that his government has made “no preparations whatsoever” for a hard border on the island.Despite the looming possibility of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Varadkar said he felt thathis government made plans to facilitate a hard border it would become a “self-fulfilling prophecy”.He insisted that Dublin was not preparing for a hard border nor was it planning to introduce any sort of physical infrastructure between Northern Ireland and the Republic.And he said the best way to avoid a hard Brexit is for Parliament to implement Theresa May’s draft withdrawal deal.The threat of a hard border is the main justication for the EU’s proposed backstop, which aims to keep NI in the EU customs union after Brexit, but which unionists fear will weaken the Union.Mr Dodds said the notion that it is necessary to have checks in the Irish Sea to avoid a hard border between NI and the Irish Republic is an “utter con trick”. The North Belfast MP added that the EU’s back up plans “totally avoid spelling out” what happens on the border, adding: “What does that tell you  Even in the event of a so-called no-deal scenario a hard border won’t happen.Gatwick drone chaos could have been avoided, says NI expertMan taken to hospital after incident in N.I. forest Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Even the Dublin authorities in its no-deal plans admitted no checks on goods at the border. “The utter hypocrisy of those espousing the current withdrawal agreement with its trap of a backstop has been completely exposed.”Asked by the News Letter this week, the EU did not explicitly say who might be responsible for building physical infrastructure at the border. But TUV leader Jim Allister has maintained that,the EU chooses to impose the hard border, Dublin would be obliged to implement it on the ground. DUP Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson said the EU and the Irish Republic’s warnings of a hard Brexit were “mere bluffs”, adding: “They will not be putting any checkpoints at the border. “A recent mapping exercise carried out by the Irish army has discovered almost  more crossings points into NI than was previously thought, making the idea of imposing a hard border totally and utter impossible.”Offering an explanation as to why the Irish border was not addressed in his government’s contingency plans, Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said the backstop is the only solution.“For us to be giving signals that there’s any other way this could be solved would be foolish,” he told RTE.Mr Coveney added that it would not be helpful for the document to be “dominated by that border debate”.Dublin’s contingency plans identied affected sectors that would require up to between  and  pieces of new legislation.The no-deal plans include the purchase of land at ports to prevent congestion from new customs.Speaking at a media briefing, Mr Varadkar said: “The contingency plans we are making are very real but they are happening at our ports, particularly Dublin Port, Dublin Airport and Rosslare, where we have acquired or are in the process of acquiring land and will develop border control posts in those places.“They may be needed in March in the event of a hard Brexit, butthey are not needed in March, they will be, or are very likely to be, needed at some point into the future.“So that is the contingency planning that we are making, but we are not making to the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. We simply cannot countenance that being the case.”try catch  TrendingThis is what N.I. prisoners will be eating on Christmas DayMan taken to hospital after incident in N.I. forestNorthern Ireland Christmas  payment dates for Universal Credit, tax credits, disability living allowance, PIP and moreSinn Fein mayor accused of lsquobad tastersquo over Irish Christmas cardN.I. family devastated after heartless thieves steal family pet          ..

Parker McGreevy and mum Louise at Springfield Road fire stationHowever as December  approaches, Park’s mum Louise McCrory and dad Simon McGreevy, who live in north Belfast, are so grateful their little boy is looking forward to Christmas morning like any other two-year-old.Louise said: “He’s looking forward to Christmas, as much as he understands it. He knows Santa is going to visit and bring him toys.“We could not be happier or prouder of how far he has come. From being told that the professionals were pessimistic about Parker’s future at seven months to watching our beautul, happy boy now – it is amazing.”She recalled Parker’s traumatic start to le: “Whenever you’re pregnant you just think you’re going to have a baby, you’re going to go home from hospital and everything’s rosey, but in my case it didn’t work like that. I had to have an emergency caesarean due to complications with my pregnancy and unfortunately Parker had multiple strokes when he was born.

I didn’t realise that a baby could have a stroke so it was shocking for all of us.”A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. Childhood stroke affects around  children year in the UK.Louise said: “Parker spent nine days in the neonatal unit and the medical staff told us that he would need lots of rehabilitation and support. We didn’t know what the future held for Parker – whether he would be able to walk or talk. He was discharged from hospital and over the last two years he has attended rounds of physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and lots of appointments as doctors measured his growth and monitored his development. It’s been tough but Parker is made of strong stuff.”Parker was recognised for his courage and bravery at the recent Stroke Association’s Le After Stroke Awards Northern Ireland celebration.To celebrate Parker’s courage the Stroke Association arranged a visit to Springfield Road Fire Station so Parker – a fan of Fireman Sam – could meet NI Fire  Rescue staff.To find out more about the Stroke Association or to donate to its Christmas appeal visit stroke.org.uk iammoreThe last-minute gt idea that could save a loved one’s le Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingGalgorm Resort and Spa evacuatedBREAKING: Newry City and Glentoran game called off due to lsquoserious traffic incident involving the match officialsrsquoBrexit hard border exposed as con trick: DUPSinn Fein mayor accused of lsquobad tastersquo over Irish Christmas cardMan taken to hospital after incident in N.I. forest          ..

But it could be a present that saves a loved one#s le.Local charity Northern Ireland Chest Heart and Strokerecently launched its Well Check Plus gt vouchers, with the aim of encouraging more people to look after their cardiovascular health.News Letter reporter Duncan Elder gets his blood pressure checked by Amy Coey, NICHS health promotion officer.As someone the wrong side of , with a diet most doctors would frown upon, I decided to go along to NICHS headquarters on Belfast’s Dublin Road for a check-up, curious and slightly nervous about what they might find.My appointment with health promotion officer Amy Coey began with the obligatory questionnaire – age, gender, health history, lestyle questions and the like. Nothing too taxing.The ‘lestyle risk assessment’ was followed by a few basic tests such as height, weight, blood pressure and cholesterol, then it was onto the ‘Tanita’ machine – an incredible piece of kit that measures body composition .I also got a sneak preview of the new AFtest, which the charity is rolling out from next month – a first for Northern Ireland.Northern Ireland Chest Heart and Stroke headquarters on the Dublin Road, Belfast.The simple test – as easy as placing your finger tips on two sensor pads for a matter of seconds – checks for an irregular heartbeat – a condition which makes the risk of stroke five times higher. Despite my initial concerns that my penchant for crisps and avoidance of rigorous exercise might have left my insides in a less than healthy state, I was delighted to learn that all my results were in the “normal range”.Recognising my obvious relief at having ‘passed the test’ , Amy was keen to give me a reality check about some of the figures and offer me tips on how to improve my health.The friendly and knowledgeable -year-old, who has been with NICHS for the past  months, is well qualied to give out such advice. She has a nursing degree and a masters in public health from Queen’s University and previously worked as a health promotion contractor.Amy Coey, NICHS health promotion officer, with one of the Well Check Plus gt vouchers.Urging others to avail of the benefits of Well Check Plus, Amy stressed that the health assessment is “quick and painless”, only taking around  minutes to complete.“I think people worry that it’s going to be quite clinical, but we are all really friendly, really approachable and the lestyle questions are a really good opportunity for people to talk about any worries or concerns and talk about how to improve their lestyle,” she said.“We launched this for Christmas as it’s a great idea for people to be able to encourage their loved ones to get things like their blood pressure and cholesterol checked. There are no signs or symptoms for some of the things we check for so it’s a really good idea for people to get checked.”Hyponatraemia inquiry: Civil servants promise action in ‘- months’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Priced at just £ – a fee which only covers the charity’s costs – the vouchers represent fantastic value for money.“It’s a small price to pay,” Amy continued. “Potentially you could be saving someone’s le. I have met so many people that I have checked their blood pressure and their cholesterol and they’ve not known that their blood pressure was high. Because of that I’ve had to refer them to their GP. They’ve gone to their GP and it’s pretty much saved their le because they’ve been put on le-long medication to lower their blood pressure and that’s potentially saved them from having a heart attack or stroke further down the line, so it’s a very small price to pay.”Although the vouchers were launched by NICHS in the run up to Christmas, they are available all year round.“It is a brilliant gt, not just for Christmas,” Amy continued. “I think of people like my dad who avoid the GP and avoid doctors. So because I would give a voucher to him as a present he has to accept it, he has to go.

For people on the breadline, the festive season, with its unremitting television ads for plump turkeys, mince pies and food galore, can be an incredibly challenging time. Across the UK food banks have fed more than , people since April  and are multiplying at an astonishing rate.Here in Northern Ireland, thousands of people, young and old, will get their Christmas groceries from a food bank.Dave Magill, Northern Ireland area manager for Trusell Trust, the anti-poverty charity which oversees the UK’s  food banks, said working with food banks is ‘‘simultaneously saddening, infuriating, uplting and inspiring’’.He said: ‘‘Working with people of such passion and commitment to serving and helping those in crisis in their community is humbling and challenging.’’‘‘Engaging with the causes and reality of food poverty in st century Northern Ireland is shocking and crushing,’’ he added.Mr Magill said last year, , people received food parcels from Trussell Trust food banks in Northern Ireland.‘‘It’s just a number and I am used to sharing it but I should never lose track of its meaning. With every number we count two stories are being told the story of hunger and the story of hope.‘‘Each food parcel that leaves one of our foodbanks tells the story of an inidual or family who had fallen into hunger. It tells a story of someone brave enough to ask for help.‘‘In a nation this wealthy the reality of that statistic breaks my heart. Each number counted tells a story of a crisis real people, with real lives, real dreams, real pain and real feelings. When numbers get to a certain point we can lose track of the humanity behind them and the story they tell. We don’t see faces in statistics.‘‘Yet each number tells a story of hope that when one person fell into crisis others were there to help. For at the same time as these very real people, in very real crisis needed help, very real strangers bought an extra tin of vegetables, a bottle of UHT milk or a jar of peanut butter and put it in a collection basket.‘‘At the same time as someone reached for help, others reached their hands out to welcome them to a food bank with a cup of tea, a smile and a biscuit.’’ Sam McBride: A year in which politics went backwards, with the slow degradation of Northern Ireland in prospect Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Magill added that the fact that food bank volunteers and donors are out there shines a little more light into the world.‘‘Food poverty should not exist but it does, and I’m grateful for the ,-plus volunteers who hate its existence as much as I do but will stand in the gap and generously give for as long as it does exist. I’m blessed to get to spend my time with them. There are no big names, no bright lights but there are thousands of heroes.’’It is often assumed food banks redistribute supermarket food . It is also commonly thought that they cater for the homeless .They help the unemployed, working poor – and, increasingly, the middle classes. Nor do people turn up out of the blue. They are referred by frontline care professionals. And they are not fed indefinitely.

But it could be a present that saves a loved one#s le.Local charity Northern Ireland Chest Heart and Strokerecently launched its Well Check Plus gt vouchers, with the aim of encouraging more people to look after their cardiovascular health.News Letter reporter Duncan Elder gets his blood pressure checked by Amy Coey, NICHS health promotion officer.As someone the wrong side of , with a diet most doctors would frown upon, I decided to go along to NICHS headquarters on Belfast’s Dublin Road for a check-up, curious and slightly nervous about what they might find.My appointment with health promotion officer Amy Coey began with the obligatory questionnaire – age, gender, health history, lestyle questions and the like. Nothing too taxing.The ‘lestyle risk assessment’ was followed by a few basic tests such as height, weight, blood pressure and cholesterol, then it was onto the ‘Tanita’ machine – an incredible piece of kit that measures body composition .I also got a sneak preview of the new AFtest, which the charity is rolling out from next month – a first for Northern Ireland.The simple test – as easy as placing your finger tips on two sensor pads for a matter of seconds – checks for an irregular heartbeat – a condition which makes the risk of stroke five times higher. Despite my initial concerns that my penchant for crisps and avoidance of rigorous exercise might have left my insides in a less than healthy state, I was delighted to learn that all my results were in the “normal range”.Recognising my obvious relief at having ‘passed the test’ , Amy was keen to give me a reality check about some of the figures and offer me tips on how to improve my health.The friendly and knowledgeable -year-old, who has been with NICHS for the past  months, is well qualied to give out such advice. She has a nursing degree and a masters in public health from Queen’s University and previously worked as a health promotion contractor.Urging others to avail of the benefits of Well Check Plus, Amy stressed that the health assessment is “quick and painless”, only taking around  minutes to complete.“I think people worry that it’s going to be quite clinical, but we are all really friendly, really approachable and the lestyle questions are a really good opportunity for people to talk about any worries or concerns and talk about how to improve their lestyle,” she said.“We launched this for Christmas as it’s a great idea for people to be able to encourage their loved ones to get things like their blood pressure and cholesterol checked. There are no signs or symptoms for some of the things we check for so it’s a really good idea for people to get checked.”Sam McBride: A year in which politics went backwards, with the slow degradation of Northern Ireland in prospect Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Priced at just £ – a fee which only covers the charity’s costs – the vouchers represent fantastic value for money.“It’s a small price to pay,” Amy continued. “Potentially you could be saving someone’s le. I have met so many people that I have checked their blood pressure and their cholesterol and they’ve not known that their blood pressure was high. Because of that I’ve had to refer them to their GP. They’ve gone to their GP and it’s pretty much saved their le because they’ve been put on le-long medication to lower their blood pressure and that’s potentially saved them from having a heart attack or stroke further down the line, so it’s a very small price to pay.”Although the vouchers were launched by NICHS in the run up to Christmas, they are available all year round.“It is a brilliant gt, not just for Christmas,” Amy continued. “I think of people like my dad who avoid the GP and avoid doctors. So because I would give a voucher to him as a present he has to accept it, he has to go. So I think particularly for people who tend to avoid their GP it’s a great idea.“Men are less likely to go see their GP.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

About eight in  employees of the National Park Service will stay home and many parks were expected to close.The Senate passed legislation ensuring workers will receive back pay, which the House seemed sure to approve.Some agencies, including the Pentagon and the departments of Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services, were already funded for the year in agreements reached earlier, and they will operate as usual.The US Postal Service, busy delivering packages for the holiday season, will not be affected because it is an independent agency.Also still ing will be the FBI, the Border Patrol and the Coast Guard. Transportation Security Administration officers will continue to staff airport checkpoints and air traffic controllers will also remain at work.Mr Trump has openly savoured a shutdown over the wall for months, saying last week he would be ldquoproud to have one and saying on Friday he was ldquototally prepared for a very long closure.While many of Congressrsquo most conservative Republicans were welcoming such a confrontation, most Republican politicians have wanted to avoid one, since polling shows the public broadly opposes the wall and a shutdown over it.A design of our Steel Slat Barrier which is totally effective while at the same time beautul! pic sGltXhcumdash Donald J.

The US and Nato retreated into a training and advising role.Bill Roggio, an Afghanistan analyst with the US-based Foundation for Defence of Democracies, said: ldquoA complete withdrawal of US forces would very likely cause the Taliban to make gains in key areas throughout Afghanistan.ldquoThis likely would cause the general collapse of theas a cohesive fighting force and lead to theof the warlords.But the Taliban said the withdrawal could in fact assist peace efforts by helping to build trust.President Donald Trump considers the war in Afghanistan a lost cause and has long pushed to pull the troops out. His decision was made public a mere few hours after he abruptly announced the US was withdrawing troops from Syria.Mr Trumprsquos state of mind is sure to have given a sense of urgency to US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who has been working to reach a negotiated end to Americarsquos longest war and has been pushing for a deal by April.In an interview with Afghanistanrsquos TOLO TV on Thursday ndash hours before the withdrawal plans were announced ndash he noted Mr Trump had campaigned for president on a promise to end the Afghan war, which has already cost Americans nearly  trillion US dollars. More than , American soldiers have died in Afghanistan since the  invasion.A Taliban official said the announcement is a positive step which could ldquolead to trust building that the US wants a political solution.But there is no sign the Taliban are ready to move on the two major sticking points: Direct talks with the Afghan government and a ceasefire while the two sides negotiate Mr Khalilzadrsquos so-called ldquoroadmap for the future of Afghanistan.Zalmay Khalilzad has been trying to reach a peace settlement in Afghanistan Peace talks aside, the announced withdrawal has Afghan generals and analysts worried about the ability of the beleaguered Afghan National Afghan Security Force to stave off a Taliban insurgency unfettered by US troops and their pounding air power.The Taliban are already stronger today than they have been since they were ousted in , controlling or holding sway over nearly half the country.Several high ranking Afghan military officials said the morale of Afghanistanrsquos under-trained and poorly equipped security forces is already at a dangerously low ebb. The troops routinely complain about reinforcements that arrive too late, equipment that fails and even running out of food.The officials called Americarsquos withdrawal a defeat, comparing it to the US evacuation from Vietnam and Russiarsquos  forced withdrawal from Afghanistan that capped a failed -year campaign..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Taliban welcomes partial US withdrawal from Afghanistan article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We are always teaching for readiness and when relationships are formed, the learning can begin.” They said staff at Lurgan Junior High School ‘would willingly embrace these young people and provide for them the best educational outcomes possible with a curriculum suited to their needs’.Their letter added: “The ideal solution would be for the pupils to remain on the Toberhewny site at a new - school, which would accommodate not only our - children but also those who would have gone on to Craigavon Senior High School .

Our pupils deserve to be treated equally.“Lurgan Junior High School is almost  years old so now is the time to be bullish and push for a modern, state of the art solution for all children in our catchment area.” In an appeal to parents they said: “Make every effort to attend the consultation meeting, Ask questions at the meeting, Speak up for your children – all are important whether Grammar or High School pupils.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flat1.jpg","title":"belfasts flatiron building takes on first tenants","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew A design agency has become the first tenant of a newly renovated Victorian listed building with another business expected to become the second soon, Ulster Business can reveal.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity.

Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house1.jpg","title":"ulster rugby player developing luxury homes","story":"Posted on Friday  December  by John Mulgrew A series of new luxury homes are being developed by an Ulster Rugby player in east Belfast, Ulster Business can reveal.Craig Gilroy, alongside developer Austin Baird, is currently building two large detached properties on a site at his home close to the Belmont Road.Work is under way on the properties, which will include a five-bedroom and six-bedroom development.“One of the properties is around , sq ft and the other , sq ft – we are still working on a price,” Mr Gilroy said.“The market seems to be pretty good, looking at the other properties in the area.”He said the properties will come to market in the next few weeks.
