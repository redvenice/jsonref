Photograph: Getty ImagesI really want to become a vet. I’m study biology and chemistry, as advised by my guidance counsellor, and volunteer locally with my local vet and pet rescue centre. However, there’s no chance I’ll score in the 600-point range to secure a place on the UCD course. Are there any other options? If your heart is set on becoming a veterinary surgeon, don’t lose hope. There are numerous routes available.Yes, securing one of the 82 places on offer in the only course in Ireland at UCD is very challenging given CAO entry points this year reached 601. Even without grade inflation, points were still high in 2019 (567 points) and under the calculated grades process in 2020 ( 587 points).Points look set to drop back somewhat in 2022, returning to a more normal results pattern arising from the traditional exams, but not I suspect to 2019 levels. This is because there will be over 10,000 applicants in this year’s CAO competition holding inflated points which they secured in 2020 and 2021.Alongside CAO points applicants must acquire at least 15 hours of practical animal handling experience between 1st February 2019 and 7th July 2022. (For full details and to complete your records of experience please visit: www.ucd.ieregistryadmissionsvet ).So, what alternatives are there? You could consider an application to one of the UK colleges through Ucas . Some new vet programmes have been added in recent years in Surrey, Nottingham, Aberystwyth in Wales, alongside the long-standing programmes. UK colleges tend to look for a H1 in both chemistry and biology and in either physics or higher level maths. Tuition fees are stg£9,250 per year.Another option is applying to programmes offered in Eastern European universities. Dr Tim O’ Leary, (timolearyvet@gmail) a veterinary surgeon in Schull in West Cork, has been for many years coordinating the application process for Irish students seeking places in the veterinary college in Budapest.He recently told me that, notwithstanding the excellent work of UCD in educating the next generation of Irish vets, there is still a strong demand at equine, farm and small animal practice levels for graduates of other EU programmes.Entry requirements for Budapest are based on a short exam in May in biology and chemistry in Dublin, and a brief interview to determine suitability.Guy Flouch, founder Eunicas.ie, has also facilitated Irish students in securing places in veterinary programmes in a number of Polish universities including Warsaw, as well as in the Czech Republic, Romania, and Bulgaria.Fees for all these Eastern European programmes can vary from €8,000-€12,000, depending on location. While it is expensive, accommodation in Warsaw or Budapest for shared apartments can be had for as little as €150-200 per month.My advice? Focus on your studies and see what your Leaving Cert produces next August. But as a form of insurance, consider applying to veterinary programmes abroad.Do you have an education query?

Photograph: Getty The Cabinet is likely to endorse National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) recommendations that children aged nine and over wear masks in school and reduce indoor socialising when it meets on Tuesday.But the Government will not make these legal requirements, instead leaving them as recommendation to schools and parents, while asking them to curtail their children’s contacts.Ministers are also expected to discuss proposed requirements for incoming travellers to have a negative PCR or professionally administered antigen test within 48-72 hours before they travel to Ireland, according to sources briefed on discussions at Government Buildings on Monday night, as part of precautions to delay the spread of the new Omicron variant of Covid-19.While discussions were continuing last night, it is expected that this will apply to people travelling from all overseas jurisdictions, including Britain.On children’s gatherings, it is understood there won’t be a blanket ban on playdates or attending pantomimes. However, one source suggested the advice to parents could be that if they were considering both activities for their children in the same week they should only do one.In general, the advice for children will be the same as for adults to reduce socialising.Variant threatThe leaders of the Government parties and Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly were briefed by senior Nphet figures including chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan on Monday evening on the current situation and on the emerging threat from the new variant.Mr Donnelly said it was likely Omicron was here and that 11 cases were being examined for possible signs of the new variant. However, officials said that while results of those tests would be available in the coming days, it would be two to three weeks before it was clear what exactly was the nature of the threat posed by the new variant.A Government source said there were some indications that the new variant could turn out to be more transmissible but less severe than the Delta variant.Countries all over Europe have tightened restrictions on people travelling from southern Africa, where the new variant was first confirmed, while cases have been identified in several EU countries since the weekend.Here it is understood that legislation to revive mandatory hotel quarantine – which was in place earlier this year but which has lapsed from the statute books – will be rushed through the Dáil this week, if the Cabinet approves on Tuesday.Antigen testsHowever, while Ministers are keen to move quickly to delay the spread of the new variant here, there is far more reluctance to introduce new restrictions on social and economic life to cope with the existing fourth wave.On Monday, the Government confirmed it had abandoned plans to subsidise antigen tests due to the fact that average prices in supermarkets had dropped to about €3 per test.Mr Donnelly called this a “good result” as it would save the taxpayer having to subsidise such testing.It is understood that, at a meeting between senior officials and representatives of retailers last week, supermarkets committed to providing the tests at about the same price as subsidised tests would have been sold at pharmacies.“It just didn’t make any sense,” one source said after discussions between senior health officials and the Department of the Taoiseach, and the plan was dropped. However, Ministers were not told, and they continued to insist that the subsidy plan would go ahead in recent days.The move has been criticised by opposition politicians. The Social Democrats co-leader, Róisín Shortall, claimed the scrapping of the scheme was a “dereliction of duty”, saying it meant the Government would have “no role in their pricing, availability, accessibility or quality control”.Sinn Féin TD David Cullinane accused the Government of “penny-pinching” and reiterated calls for antigen tests to be made freely available, saying the “rollback” on a subsidy was “deeply disappointing”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"omicron symptoms are mild scientist in south african lab where variant discovered","story":"The heavily mutated Omicron coronavirus variant is likely to spread internationally and poses a high risk of infection surges that could have severe consequences in some places, the World Health Organisation has said. Video: ReutersDr Allison Glass of the Lancet Laboratory in Johannesburg said there is no evidence that the new variant causes more severe disease. A clinical virologist at the laboratory in South Africa where the Omicron variant was detected has said that people who have tested positive for the variant are showing mild symptoms so far.Dr Allison Glass of the Lancet Laboratory in Johannesburg said there is no evidence that the new variant causes more severe disease.“From what we’ve seen so far, from the patients and doctors we have been in discussion with, the symptoms are mild currently. They are similar to symptoms we’ve seen from other Covid-19 variants,” Dr Glass told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.“We are starting to see some hospitalisations but that is probably just a factor of the number of cases we’re seeing but as yet, there’s no evidence to suggest Omicron causes more severe disease than previous variants.”She expressed disappointment that travel restrictions had been imposed on South Africa when the reality was that such information was important to plan for a possible surge.She said that reactions as had been seen in the past few days could make the scientific community reluctant to be transparent “when there is this type of backlash”, she said.Many countries do not carry out genome sequencing and just because they were not aware did not mean there were no variants.“It’s disappointing that we’re being punished for being on top of what’s happening.”VigilanceDr Glass said that it was the vigilance of a junior scientist that identified the new variant.As a virologist Dr Glass said that she knew that the virus was going to continue to change. “That’s their nature - to evolve, it’s not unexpected.”It was good to be aware of what was happening. Knowledge was important for capacity planning, but it was early days, she said. “We shouldn’t jump to any conclusions.”Variants were a way of showing that the virus “will stick around,” but they should not cause panic, she said.A South African doctor who was one of the first to suspect a different coronavirus strain among patients said on Sunday that symptoms of the Omicron variant were so far mild and could be treated at home.Dr Angelique Coetzee, a private practitioner and chair of South African Medical Association, told Reuters that on November 18th she noticed seven patients at her clinic who had symptoms different from the dominant Delta variant, albeit “very mild”.Dr Coetzee said a patient reported at her clinic being “extremely fatigued” for two days with body aches and headache.On the same day, more patients came in with similar symptoms, which was when she realised there was “something else going on.” Since then, she’s seen two to three patients a day.TransmissibleThe new coronavirus variant appears to be more transmissible than its predecessors although most cases have been mild so far, according to scientists advising the South African government.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"mica redress scheme finalised after intense talks on increased rates","story":"Thousands of homeowners affected by Mica, and their supporters, protest in Dublin for a 100 per cent redress scheme from the Government in October. Photograph: Laura Hutton The Government finalised a redress scheme late last night for thousands of families in Donegal and Mayo affected by mica following a day of intense negotiations over increased rates for repairing affected homes.It followed agreement being reached between the Department and groups representing affected homeowners on the three outstanding issues: certification the status of homes that have been excluded from the scheme and the maximum allowable “per foot” cost to rebuild the homes.The latter point in particular had proved a real sticking point for the Mica campaign groups and for the Donegal and Mayo TDs who support them.The Government had offered an average “per foot” rebuild cost of €138 per square foot.Clearer languageGovernment sources last night said the final memo would contain clearer language that would give a better indication of the “per foot” cost than an average of €138, suggesting it would be higher in some cases.This had been an issue of some contention. Government TDs such as Donegal Fine Gael TD Joe McHugh, and Fianna Fáil’s Dara Calleary (Mayo) and Charlie McConalogue (Donegal) have consistently said they fully supported the campaign. Mr McHugh had warned of defying the Government whip if the issue was not settled to the satisfaction of the campaign group.He said he could not support a scheme that did not take into account inflation in the construction industry from 2020.“The issue is the proposed maximum payable per square foot. If the square footage is not affordable, the scheme will not be accessible,” he said.“My position has not changed. At the end of the day, if those affected are not accepting it, they are back on the street. And if they are back on the street the nightmare continues.“I just can’t, in all conscience, stand over something that is not acceptable and will still have the people on the streets. That’s not feasible from my point of view.”Mr O’Brien’s memo has also proposed: the current 90 per cent maximum grant to be increased to a 100 per cent grant for all remediation options the maximum grant cap to be increased to €420,000 from €247,500 alternative accommodation costs to a maximum of €15,000 and a new independent appeals process to be introduced.In a recent concession, the Government agreed to extend the scheme beyond principal private residences to also cover rental properties.There were intensive discussions yesterday involving Mr O’Brien, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and TDs from the affected counties, including Mr McHugh.“The group doesn’t have an issue with the cap of €420,000 per house,” Mr McHugh said last night. “Their issue today is the square footage cap.“We are going to have to find a better way of figuring out the square footage. It is still going to lead to families paying a whopping amount.”"},{"url":null,"title":"motor industry to argue for retention of ev incentives","story":"The Government aims to have almost a million EVs on Irish roads by 2030 as part of the Climate Action Plan. Photograph: iStockIncentives for the purchase of electric vehicles (EVs) will need to be kept if the Government is to get close to its climate action targets, politicians will be told on Tuesday.The Society of the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI) will also tell the Committee on the Environment that the the supply of EVs for the used-car market could be boosted if the State were to replace its planned new fleets of electric cars every two years.Government aims to have almost a million EVs on Irish roads by 2030 as part of the Climate Action Plan.It has promised a “generous regime” of tax incentives including “substantial vehicle registration tax (VRT) relief and benefit-in-kind (BIK) exemptions”.It has also pledged to mandate the purchase of zero-emission electric vehicles for State fleets where available and operationally feasible by end of 2022. There is also to be a new scheme for the rollout of 200 on-street public charging points per year.SIMI is due to be represented at the committee on Tuesday by its director general, Brian Cooke, while TDs and Senators will also hear from representatives of the ESB’s e-cars unit.Mr Cooke’s opening statement says the motor industry “can, and will deliver EVs in large numbers” while cautioning that this is “not just in the hands of the industry”.He will say it “needs the State’s continued assistance to help build the conditions that will allow motorists confidently move to an EV at the earliest possible stage”.Mr Cooke will argue that “we need the State to continue its investment in supporting electric vehicles.”While accepting that supports “can’t last for ever” and the State has been “generous to date”, Mr Cooke will tell committee that there has been a “a gradual erosion in recent years of these supports”.His statement adds that Ireland is competing with other EU countries for the supply of new EVs and to ensure it can optimise its share, “incentives must remain”.Second-hand marketA focus on the business fleet and company car sector would boost used EV availability Mr Cooke says as such cars are typically released to the market when they are two to four years old.“In addition, with the Government commitment to electrifying its own fleets, a requirement that these EVs be traded every two years could also increase supply to the used car market.”And he suggests another immediate action that would help would be the extension of the home-charging grant to second-hand EV buyers.Mr Cooke will say that the current supply of used EVs is not adequate and that Brexit and tax changes on UK imports have affected the used-car market here.Representatives of the ESB will tell the committee that the demand for EVs has increased dramatically in recent years and “the issue of range anxiety has somewhat been addressed by the latest generation of EVs that have significantly increased ranges”.They will tell the committee that the number of charging sessions on its system has tripled since the beginning of 2021, reaching about 70,000 sessions per month.The committee will hear how the ESB qualified for €10 million in funding from the Climate Action Fund and how it will match this with a further €10 million.An update will be provided on its investment programme and how the ESB will expand and enhance the public charging network across Ireland to help meet the expected growth of EVs in the coming years."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Oil wealth and new

three months second dose","story":"The NHS has been ordered to speed up the booster rollout, with the Health Secretary warning that the programme needs to be put on steroids ahead of a feared wave of the omicron variant. Health officials have announced radical changes in the rollout of the vaccination programme, starting with the expansion of booster jabs to everyone aged 18 and over. The plans will see the gap between second and third dose cut to a minimum of three months.So far, 17.8 million people have received boosters, of 25.3 million who could come forward. The changes in the advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) would mean another 20 million people would be eligible by Christmas.In theory, this would mean most of the adult population could be jabbed in the next month. But at the current rate of rollout, with 2.4 million jabs administered a week, it would take three months for the programme to reach this point. Officials hope to increase this to 3.5 million vaccines a week, but expect this to take several weeks.At a Downing Street briefing on Monday, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer, said the booster campaign was now as urgent as it could possibly be in order to prepare the country’s defences against the omicron variant.He said a “true national effort” was required, calling for volunteers to come forward to speed up the rollout. The more boosting we can do by the time we have any significant amount of omicron activity in the UK is going to be very, very important, he told a Downing Street press conference.How fast that will build up in the UK and to what extent it will build up in the UK is something we don\u0027t know. We are in uncharted territory.”Prof Wei Lim, chairman of the JCVI, said the changes were being made in an effort to deploy the vaccine before “any possible wave” of the new variant. Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, told the Commons he wanted to “put the booster programme on steroids because that will really help us”.He said the moves were “a huge step up for our vaccination programme, almost doubling the number of people who will be able to get a booster dose to protect themselves and their loved ones.But on Monday, NHS officials were unable to say when the rules would even take effect. Officials insisted that anyone who had waited more than three months since their second dose should wait to be contacted.People would continue to be prioritised in age order, they said.Booking opened up to those in their 40s last week, under rules which insisted on a six-month gap between doses. The change in the interval to three months should speed up the rollout and ensure those aged 40 and over get their third jabs before Christmas.However, it is unclear how many younger people will be offered jabs this year. At the height of the rollout last spring, the programme was administering around 3.5 million jabs a week. But since then the rollout has been scaled back, with about 50 mass vaccination centres closing and many GPs dropping out of the programme.Prof Van Tam said on Monday: “I think the important message that the NHS wanted me to convey to you today is that they understand the real urgency of this. “They are up for the task, but they say that they will contact you when you need to act. And they will open the booking in any orderly way, because one of the things we really don\u0027t want is people from the very youngest now eligible cohorts somehow getting in front of people who are much, much higher risk of a bad outcome if they were to get Covid-19.”On Monday, the NHS booking website was deluged with people trying to book a booster, with thousands of people joining online queueing systems only to find they were not yet eligible. Monty Don, 66, the Gardeners\u0027 World star complained that he had yet to be called up for a jab, despite being eligible for more than a month. He said there appeared to be no booster programme in Herefordshire. NHS officials said sites were available in the county, if people went online. The JCVI also gave the green light to second jabs for children aged 12 to 15, after a 12-week interval. Children in that age group are currently only offered one dose of the Covid vaccine.  The precaution was taken because of evidence from other countries linking most cases of myocarditis to second jabs. But the committee said the evidence found second doses were safe, with any risks outweighed by benefits. And regulators said a decision about the safety of Covid jabs for children aged five to 11 is likely to be taken before Christmas. Two further cases of omicron were announced in England on Monday, along with six extra cases in Scotland - bringing the UK total to 11.Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of the NHS, said the arrival of the new variant was a “wake-up call” for the country.She told a Kings’ Fund conference: “I know that NHS staff will again move heaven and earth to vaccinate as many people as possible, giving us all the best chance to enjoy Christmas with family and with friends.”Health officials said existing centres would open longer hours, with an expansion in hospital sites offering jabs, as part of efforts to speed up the rollout. Prof Van-Tam said there was a high degree of current uncertainty about the omicron variant.He told the press conference: I do not want people to panic at this stage,” but said it would be wise not to “completely ignore the weather forecast” coming from South Africa. Prof Van-Tam said there were still uncertainties about how transmissible the variant was and its impact on severity of disease.On the effects of the new variants, and how well vaccine effectiveness will hold up, here I want to be clear that this is not all doom and gloom at this stage, he said.I do not want people to panic at this stage. If vaccine effectiveness is reduced, as seems pretty likely to some extent, the biggest effects are likely to be in preventing infections and, hopefully, there will be smaller effects on preventing severe disease.An NHS spokesman said: “The NHS is having to work at extreme pace to respond to this new variant and to put in place the next and most complex phase of the successful Covid-19 vaccination programme.“Following updated guidance from the JCVI, the NHS will shortly set out how staff will expand the booster programme.“This will include how booster jabs will be given in priority order so that the most vulnerable people are protected first, while also increasing capacity to vaccinate millions more people in a shorter space of time.“The NHS will contact you when you are due to book in for your life-saving booster vaccination, and when you get the call, it’s vital that people come forward as quickly as possible.”More from NewsAtrocity of slavery stains our history, Prince Charles tells Barbados as it ends royal ruleAbusive parents such as mother of Baby P face life in jail under tougher child cruelty lawsNew omicron rules must be temporary\u0026#39White thought crimes\u0026#39 are resurfacing at CambridgeTuesday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Why face masks became the symbol of a ided BritainMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"joe biden omicron variant no cause panic","story":"Joe Biden on Monday said there was no need for new Covid restrictions in the face of the omicron variant and its emergence was not a cause for panic.Speaking from the White House, the US president predicted that cases of the variant would reach America – but added that was not a reason for another lockdown.This variant is a cause for concern, not a cause for panic, Mr Biden said. If people are vaccinated and wear their mask, there\u0027s no need for lockdowns.His comments mark a contrast to the approach taken by Boris Johnson, who has been accused of rushing into a new crackdown over the weekend despite a lack of clarity over the potency of omicron. South African scientists said there was no evidence of the variant causing serious illness, and no hospitalisations have yet been recorded. However, Mr Johnson pushed ahead with new requirements for people to wear face masks in certain settings and self-isolate after arriving from abroad, which come into effect at 4am on Tuesday.The NHS has been ordered to speed up the rollout of Covid booster vaccines as Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, vowed to put the third jabs programme on steroids.All adults will be eligible for a top-up jab and the waiting time after the second dose has been slashed from six months to three after the Government\u0027s science advisers agreed to the change.Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the UK\u0027s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said the booster campaign was now as urgent as it could possibly be – but there were few details on exactly when younger adults can get the jab.Around 25 million people who have yet to get their boosters are now in line for a third jab at some point, but on Monday night NHS officials were unable to say when the rule change would take effect.Downing Street is hoping to get a million more people a week jabbed with boosters than the current rate – an increase of around 40 per cent. It would mean a rise from around 2.4 million booster jabs being deployed a week to 3.4 million. Government officials believe it could take three to four weeks to reach that figure.On Monday, two further cases of the omicron variant were detected in England and six more in Scotland, taking the UK total to 11. But scientists warned it could be weeks before the threat the variant poses to current vaccine resistance is known.Mr Johnson has issued a fresh plea to Britons to get vaccinated, with ministers arguing that, whatever the danger posed by omicron, people will be better protected if jabbed.The measures taking effect are proportionate and responsible, and will buy us time in the face of this new variant, the Prime Minister said in a statement. Based on everything we know, our vaccines and boosters remain our best line of defence – so it is more important than ever that people come forward when eligible to get boosted.Not only will today\u0027s steps help us slow down the variant\u0027s spread, but they will also help us protect each other and the gains we have all worked so hard for. The measures are temporary and precautionary, and will be reviewed in three weeks. The regulations will be kept under review to ensure they only remain necessary and proportionate.Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, and Mark Drakeford, her Welsh counterpart, called on the Government to go further on new restrictions. In a letter to Mr Johnson, they requested eight days of self-isolation for all new arrivals, a Treasury guarantee of more financial support and a Cobra meeting to discuss omicron.However, all three requests were rebuffed, with both Downing Street and Mr Javid arguing those steps were not needed – even as they stressed that nothing could be categorically ruled out in the future.Mr Javid told MPs that if omicron proved to be no more dangerous than the delta variant prevalent in the UK, the new restrictions would not be kept a day longer than necessary. On Tuesday, MPs will vote on the measures – but there was frustration on Monday that they were only being given a say after the legal changes came into effect.Details released by the Government on Monday night showed the new face masks requirement would apply more widely than previously believed, including in hair salons and veterinary surgeries.Greg Clark, the Tory MP and former Cabinet minister, urged Mr Javid to avoid taking any panic measures if we see a rise in infections during the weeks ahead, as seems inevitable, and concentrate instead on the vaccines\u0027 effectiveness against severe illness and hospitalisation.Mr Javid said Mr Clark was absolutely right that what matters as we look ahead around this new variant - is, more than anything, hospitalisations.The Health Secretary also rejected Labour calls for face masks to be made compulsory in pubs, restaurants and school classrooms, telling MPs: If we want to live with the virus for the long term, we must follow the evidence and act in a proportionate and responsible way if a variant has the potential to thwart our progress.And as we do this we are taking a well-rounded view, looking not just the impact of these measures on the virus, but the impact to the economy, education, and non-Covid health such as mental health.More from NewsAtrocity of slavery stains our history, Prince Charles tells Barbados as it ends royal ruleAbusive parents such as mother of Baby P face life in jail under tougher child cruelty lawsNew omicron rules must be temporary\u0026#39White thought crimes\u0026#39 are resurfacing at CambridgeTuesday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Why face masks became the symbol of a ided BritainMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"snp distract dismal record trying censure boris","story":"Tuesday Nov 30 is the feast of St Andrew, the patron saint of Scotland (and Russia, Greece, Ukraine and a host of other countries). In recognition of the date, the main business in the House of Commons has been given over to an Opposition Day for the Scottish National Party.Opposition Days are an opportunity for Labour and the other minority parties to highlight issues high up their agenda. We learned at the weekend that the SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, intends to table a motion of censure against the Prime Minister, to concentrate the focus of the House on his personal failings as leader of Her Majesty\u0027s Government. A cynic might note that the party has chosen not to debate a policy area such as education, health or welfare certainly nothing that in Scotland is a devolved matter.Blackford is not a man short of bluster. When he rises to speak at Prime Minister’s Questions on a Wednesday, there is an audible groan from all sides of the House. Addressing his party’s conference on Sunday, he spoke of the SNP providing the “real opposition” – quite a boast for a party with 45 MPs in a House of 650, clearly intended as a slight at Labour’s lacklustre performance.“Unless he faces consequences for his disastrous actions, he won\u0027t just think he\u0027s gotten away with the mess he has made of the last few months – he will think he can do it all over again,” Blackford went on.The SNP then tweeted that the motion to be debated on Tuesday would underline the fact that Scots had “no confidence” in Boris Johnson’s leadership.There was a swift ‘clarification’. While the SNP seeks to demonstrate “no confidence” in the Government, it is not – as some incautious souls may have incorrectly assumed – tabling a motion of no confidence. Instead, Blackford will table a ‘motion of censure’, a broader and less formal instrument which usually comes in the form of an Early Day Motion. Motions of no confidence have specific consequences, and that is emphatically not the SNP’s style.Why does this matter? Because it is all related to Blackford’s mention of “consequences”. Quite apart from the Prime Minister facing them, it is the SNP leader who is afraid of them. He knows that a motion of censure will be defeated, and defeated heavily. Previous such motions, against Chris Grayling and Esther McVey during their time in cabinet, were soundly rejected. Confidence motions are serious constitutional business, and can lead to the collapse of governments. This ‘censure’ motion is just parliamentary chaff.Fair-minded readers might then wonder why Blackford would wish to pursue such an obviously doomed strategy. Is he some kind of latter-day Lord Raglan, ordering his troops into a disastrous action which can only end in defeat? Yes and no. Blackford knows that he does not have the numbers even to alarm the government. Johnson’s working majority is 77, so even the official opposition is powerless under normal circumstances.In the tartan-blinded world of the SNP, however, Blackford does not need to win. By choosing a motion of censure, he avoids taking on the government on central policy areas like education or health: areas in which the SNP administration in Edinburgh is failing badly. Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister, twists and turns to avoid defending her record in office, preferring to concentrate on independence, the great panacea, and the supposed evils of the government in Westminster. So Blackford will try not to open his substantial flank to that kind of criticism.The focus will be Boris, Boris, Boris, because the Prime Minister’s personality and style are held to play less well in Scotland than they do south of the border. A recent poll found his approval rating to be -62, even worse that Sir Keir Starmer (-35). So, the SNP’s logic goes, play the man, not the ball.And heavy defeat in parliamentary terms suits Blackford too. It reinforces the idea of “them and us”, of Westminster against Scotland, of the SNP as a brave band of freedom fighters against the political establishment. Never mind that they have occupied Bute House, the official residence of the first minister, for 15 years. Scottish history is, in any event, littered with ‘noble’ defeats: Halidon Hill, Flodden, Solway Moss, Culloden.Ian Blackford knows what he is doing. Tomorrow he will line up his small band against the government’s big battalions, and, in parliamentary terms, it will be a massacre. But that suits him. For it stokes the fires of grievance, drives a wedge between the Scottish electorate and the government, and performs a vital act of prestidigitation. Look not at our record, goes the SNP war cry, but at our enemies.More from NewsAtrocity of slavery stains our history, Prince Charles tells Barbados as it ends royal ruleAbusive parents such as mother of Baby P face life in jail under tougher child cruelty lawsNew omicron rules must be temporary\u0026#39White thought crimes\u0026#39 are resurfacing at CambridgeTuesday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Why face masks became the symbol of a ided BritainMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"face masks became symbol divided britain","story":"Tis the season. Advent calendars waiting on mantelpieces. The jingle-jangle of sleigh bells on an endless muzak loop. A portly man promising a season of goodwill only for a grisly Covid variant to change everything and No 10’s advice to slip from ho-ho-ho to no-no-no. The crackdown’s first edict is already here. Today, like some unwelcome rehash of a movie you didn’t like the first time round, is Mask Day 2. At 4am today, the new regime dawned, replacing the do-as-you-see-fit attitude that followed “Freedom Day” on July 19 with an order to mask up in shops and on public transport. It had to be masks. There are a host of so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) able to dent Covid, from handwashing and work-from-home directives to full national lockdown. But, of all the options on the menu, none is so isive in Britain as the wearing of masks. None polarises us more, setting very British attitudes at odds with each other: the deferential queue observer against the authority questioner the selfless, polite personality against the robust, self-reliant inidual. It is as though our island’s character has been resolved into contradictions. Indeed on this issue the Union is indeed ided, with different rules in its four constituent parts. Today’s promise is that those who don’t comply will be walloped with a series of £200 fines, which double with each reoffence. But anyone who has seen “enforcement” on the London Underground – where staff themselves wear masks around their chins as canned messages demand passengers muffle up – will know this is likely to be a charade. Instead we must prepare ourselves for the return of that ultimate in British authority: the tutting and eye-rolling of social disapproval. What official force can compare? Other countries may endure anti-lockdown riots directed at the state, but Britain does it differently. From today, my friends, it is not us against them, but us against us as, with pursed lips or defiant stares, we once again begin to police ourselves.Who knows why this devolution of enforcement to the inidual is particular to Britain, but it is. Take a trip to France and you discover a host of measures that seem sensible there but unimaginable here. Want to get on the train? You need a mask and proof of vaccine. Two centuries of statist edicts from the centre make such rules unremarkable. And as for the draconian rules of Spain, or Greece, well it’s easy to forget that both were Right-wing military dictatorships within the last half century. Whereas we, in sometimes self-congratulating style, do cherish the whole Mother of Parliaments bit. And that Parliament is led by a man whose every fibre rebels against the nanny state, even if the pandemic might demand, from time to time, a dose of unpleasant nannying. From the very beginning, the experts at Sage’s behavioural insight subcommittee (Spi-B) were clear that, if the country was not to dissolve in bitter acrimony over masks, strong leadership would be required. “If government is to recommend that the public wear face masks in the community,” it noted on April 20 2020, a month into lockdown one, “there will need to be thorough guidance and communication.” Without it, we would have “heightened public awareness, negative evaluation and harassment of people who are not wearing face masks, leading to ision which could undermine collective solidarity which is helpful for managing the pandemic.”Instead of such clear guidance and communication, however, there was fudge. To begin with, that was not unusual. After all, at the beginning of the pandemic even the WHO considered there was insufficient evidence that masks reduced transmission. But that was when droplets from coughs and surface contact were considered the two main vectors, and the dangers of aerosols – particles hanging around in the air for ages – were largely unrecognised. On May 11 the first recommendations were made in England: the Government advised the use of a face coverings, but only in enclosed spaces, where social distancing was difficult. A month later, they became mandatory on public transport. A month after that, in shops, too. Such off-on requirements were off again this summer, but the ambiguity remained as official advice stated that “you are expected and recommended to continue wearing a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces ... where the risk of transmission is likely to be greater.” Yet as we all know, Tory MPs on the Government benches have almost all abandoned masks, while Labour seem to have a three-line whip enforcing them. Professor Robert West, a psychologist on Spi-B, has warned how confusing this all can be. “People who are ambivalent, it gives them a kind of excuse to say, ‘If they’re not doing it why should I do it?’” The PM, however, prefers nudge to nanny-state. “Nudging” can be highly effective and has certainly informed the decision to market masks as a tool to protect others, as much as (if not more than) to protect oneself. Psychological studies suggest we like people more after doing something nice for them. Social cohesiveness is built on the giving and receiving of favours – like wearing a mask to protect them. As Spi-B noted as long ago as April 2020: “Wearing a face mask could demonstrate that an inidual is concerned for other people’s welfare and is enacting desired social norms around safety and hygiene.”Recently, though, the question has been: “What social norms?” In the early days, evidence of mask effectiveness was inconclusive but the goal to limit the spread of the virus was universal. Before vaccines or treatments we didn’t want to catch it and even thought we might be able to contain it.Now data on masks is much clearer. Observational studies report big reductions in infection (as high as 53 per cent). Two randomised trials, usually considered more reliable, report smaller, but still important, reductions of around 10 per cent. But stopping Covid’s spread is no longer so important to many people. Schools resemble chicken-pox parties, where parents drop off children to get them exposed to the virus, with the aim of better preparing them to fight infection later in life. Who now doesn’t expect to get Covid eventually?The answer, of course, is the elderly and vulnerable. But the fabric of social cohesion is fraying as more and more of us shrug and reconcile ourselves to the endemic nature of the disease. Liberty vs solidarity: the framing of today’s response is inherently political, Right vs Left. And nothing signals that better than a mask. As time has gone on, they have become ever-more like personal political broadcasts on behalf of the wearer. For the last few months, though, like manifestos out of campaign season, they have been largely uncontested. But today, once again, the national edict will freight them with moral significance. Prof David Halpern, chief executive of the Government’s Behavioural Insights Team, known as the Nudge Unit, who also sits on Sage, reckons that “the British are particularly good at this”.For the Government, such social policing has evident benefits: the brazen maskless commuter and the tutting double-masker hate each other, not Whitehall, which avoids becoming the target of widespread public ire. Some might argue that this is a blame-avoidance tactic dressed up as policy. Now, though, we are facing a rewind moment, a potential reset to March 2020. Instead of laissez-faire we are once again instructed to do our best to prevent the spread of the virus. This time, however, we all know from experience we cannot stop it. We can only delay. What price we are each prepared to pay to do that, after 18 months, is anyone’s guess. Government nudgers – long amazed by how compliant we’ve all been – may once again find themselves astonished and delighted. The risk is, of course, that the silent social self-regulation of British people finally gives way, and the phony war between Mask On-ers and Mask Off-ers collapses into open hostility.More from NewsAtrocity of slavery stains our history, Prince Charles tells Barbados as it ends royal ruleAbusive parents such as mother of Baby P face life in jail under tougher child cruelty lawsNew omicron rules must be temporary\u0026#39White thought crimes\u0026#39 are resurfacing at CambridgeTuesday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Ghislaine Maxwell \u0026#39a scapegoat\u0026#39 for Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s crimesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tuesday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Welcome to your early morning news briefing from The  - a round-up of the top stories we are covering on Tuesday.

The Omicron iant appears to have originated in South Africa and caused Prime Minister Boris Johnson to announce the reintroduction of some restrictions in public, like mask-wearing.Refusing to wear a face mask in areas where they have been outlined as mandatory could land people with a £ fine. It is not yet knownthe new iant is more harmful and some doctors believe the symptoms to be milder to the ones caused by the Delta iant, but it is possible that it is more transmissible and more resistant to vaccines and nothing has been confirmed yet.Whether further restrictions will be put in place remains to be seen, but there seem to be no plans for a lockdown currently. The current restrictions are only minor, but what are they  Where do I have to wear a mask   People must wear shops on public transport or in shops unless they are medically exempt from doing so, but more places have also been announced by Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Children under  do not have to wear a mask. A full list of the indoor places you have to wear a face mask was released on Monday, November , , and includes:Shops and supermarkets Shopping centresTakeaways Auction houses and retail galleriesPost offices, banks, building societies, high street solicitors and accountants, credit unions, short term loan providers, savings clubs and money service businesses Estate and letting agents and retail travel agentsPremises providing personal care and beauty treatmentsPharmaciesVetsPublic transport services Taxis and private hire vehicles Transport hubs Face coverings must also be worn in any car or small van during a professionally delivered driving lesson, a practical driving test or during one of the practical tests for giving driving instruction. Those who do not cover their faces with a mask could end up with a £ fine. This is doubled for each offence and could land people with an eventual fine of £,, which is the maximum.  The hospitality sector is exempt from the changes, so these rules wonapost apply in restaurants, cafes, bars or pubs. The UK, Italy and Germany have all now confirmed the presence of Omicron in their respective countries. The World Health Organisationcannot yet confirmthe virus is more easily transmitted orit is more resistant to vaccines. Currently, this is only suspected but is likely the reason behind the restrictions being reintroduced. In response, the government is also expected to announce the expansion of the booster jab scheme to make all adults eligible for it. Where do you not need to wear a face mask  While there have been several additions to places where it is now legally mandatory to wear a face mask, including in enclosed shopping centres and inside banks, hospitality venues do no require face coverings. Below is the full list of places where you do not need to wear a face mask:Restaurants Cafes and canteens Bars Pubs Shisha bars Any other premises “wholly or mainly” used to eat or drink Premises offering medical and dental services Photography studios When do restrictions come back   Restrictions introduced by the government take effect from am on Tuesday, November . The government brought England into line with the rest of the UK by reintroducing the restrictions.There are currently no plans for further restrictions and the new rules are subject to review in three weeks. Sajid Javid said that, at present, people can expect to have a normal Christmas. He told Sky Newsapos Trevor Phillips: I think people should continue with their plans as normal for Christmas, I think itaposs going to be a great Christmas. Passengers arriving back in the UK from abroad must take a PCR test after their arrival,they touch down in the UK after the restrictions take effect on November .All those suspected to have the new Omicron iant will also be required to isolate for  days.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON DeltaWorld Health OrganisationBoris JohnsonPublic transportPoliticsCoronavirusOmicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

So what exactly is changing and how will it affect you  Here are all your questions answered.Where will I need to wear a face mask Face masks will be mandatory by law in England’s shops, public transport including taxis, hairdressers, banks and post offices from am on Tuesday. They will also be compulsory during driving tests and at pharmacies. Those who do not comply can be fined £ for a first offence , doubling on each repeat offence up to £,. Police will be expected to enforce the rules. But masks will not be mandatory in pubs and restaurants, or cinemas and theatres, like they were before. Government guidance advises people to wear masks in crowded indoor spaces, but this is not a legal requirement. What are the new foreign travel rules From am on Tuesday, all arrivals in the UK from anywhere in the world must take a paid-for PCR test within  hours of their arrival - and isolate until the result comes back negative. Previously, vaccinated travellers only had to take a lateral flow Day  test, and did not have to isolate. The new rules apply even to the double-jabbed. Arrivals who land without having booked a Day  test in advance can be fined £, on the spot. Ten African countries were added to England’s red list over the weekend, forcing all arrivals into hotel quarantine costing £, a head for  nights. The  nations are Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Those who breach isolation rules can be fined between £ and £,. When will I have to self-isolate All close contacts of suspected Omicron cases will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status.Those affected will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace. It’s not thought the Covid- app will single out those who have to isolate.Elsewhere, people travelling to the UK must self-isolate until their Day  test is negative - as above. People who test positive for Covid must still self-isolate for  days, regardless of vaccine status. And unvaccinated or partially-vaccinated close contacts of a Covid case must still self-isolate for  days, regardless of whether it’s the Omicron iant.Who will get a booster vaccine - and when All adults in the UK will now be offered a Covid booster vaccine - Pfizer or Moderna - in a much shorter time period than before. Third doses will be fast-tracked, with people able to get them three months instead of six months after their second dose. While immunity is said to be better with a six-month gap, the JCVI watchdog weighed that up against the risks of waiting too long with a new iant. However, people will have to wait for their place in the queue. Boosters will be offered in descending order of age in five-year brackets. So -year-olds may have to wait a while. Downing Street was unable to say how long the booster rollout will take. No hopes to see a more detailed timetable published by NHS England “in the coming days”. People should not yet go online and try to booktheyaposre . Meanwhile --year-olds will be offered a second dose. Will schools shut early for Christmas Since Monday, the government is “strongly advising” school pupils above year , staff, and visitors to wear face coverings in communal areas of England’s schools. Local public health teams can send groups of pupils home as a last-ditch measure to stop the spread. But No insisted schools will not shut early for Christmas this year. The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said the Government will keep schools open until they had absolutely no choice but to close the institutions down.Can Christmas parties and gatherings go ahead Yes, there is no legal restriction on Christmas parties. People do not need by law to wear masks or show a vaccine passport in hospitality venues. Health Minister Edward Argar said the government will let people in England “use their judgments” about whether to attend festive bashes this year. But the minister also warned people “will reflect carefully on how they are going to react” to the new iant. Voluntary government guidance advises people to wear masks in crowded indoor spaces, and take a lateral flow test before socialising with other people. Why are these restrictions being introduced Scientists are alarmed by the Omicron iant because it has more than  mutations, which potentially means it could resist the vaccine. Therefore, the government is introducing restrictions to buy time for scientists to work out whether it’s as bad as they fear. At the moment, No admitted, “no one has any hard evidence of its impact on things like hospitalisations”. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said scientists must get live samples of the Omicron virus and test them, asking the public: Please, everyone needs to give us time to assemble that data.He added: “I’m asking people not to panic - but I’m not asking them either to completely ignore the weather forecast.” Are the rules strong enough to work Several key figures say they are not. Labour’s Angela Rayner called for mask mandates to also apply to pubs and other hospitality settings, when people are moving around. She added: “Itaposs so important that people wear masks when theyaposre indoors, in arenas where theyaposre meeting people and... mixing in large numbers.”Scotland and Wales’ First Ministers wrote to Boris Johnson demanding all UK arrivals isolate for eight days, with PCR tests on day  and day . Currently they’ll only have to isolate until a Day  test comes back negative. Health Secretary Sajid Javid insisted his approach was “proportionate”. Will the rules be tightened further It is possible. Boris Johnson has not yet enacted all of England’s ‘Plan B’ measures, leaving vaccine passports for nightclubs and stadiums in reserve. The government has also not advised people in England to work from home where possible, despite advice of that kind in Scotland. Askedthe Government might tighten up England’s rules even further in the next three weeks, minister Edward Argar said: Itaposs not something Iaposm anticipating. But the PM’s spokesman did not rule out tighter travel rules. No said Boris Johnson was not “planning” to adopt Scotland and Wales’ plea for eight days’ isolation, but did not rule it out, saying the response would be kept under review.When will they expire The measures will last three weeks and expire on December , with a review ahead of that. That means they could be ended, continued or strengthened in time for Christmas. MPs will also get a vote on the measures, likely on Tuesday or Wednesday.

Ian Brown, , was left scratching his head when he was delivered a damaged box with no product inside. The package was supposed to hold £ worth of skincare products and bin bags, which were ordered by his girlfriend on the Amazon website. He claims as he watched over his footage again, he observed the driver photographing the item asto show it had been successfully delivered. Mr Brown stated that usually for his deliveries, the driver knocks on his front door. He claimed he saw the driver at the side of his house and heard him aposgigglingapos.  He said: “It was sort of mischievous laughter. I could see the parcel and it was completely flat. I thought ‘he cannot have delivered that. “But when I went back to the CCTV I found it had been put behind some flower pots and photographed it. Ian maintained he was not awareit had been deliberately taken out or had fallen out but nonetheless called the service aposunprofessionalapos. Amazon has now refunded the couple for the skincare products and replaced the bags. Despite the reimbursement, Mr Brown is concerned about the goodwill gesture affecting any possible future circumstances when he will need a refund. He argued thatsomething higher value went missing from his package, it would be his word against the driver. He added: “If the driver spots the parcel is damaged they are supposed to knock and wait for you to open the door and reject it. Now Mr Brown has been left scarred from the ordeal, stating he is afraid to purchase any more items from Amazon. He said: “None of the process for a genuinely damaged parcel has been followed. I wanted to buy an Xbox off Amazon but there is no chance in hell of that now, or of buying anything of value. “Although this parcel was heavy it contained nothing of value. But you would not know from outside. “Something has gone wrong here and it needs investigating.” However Amazon has responded, stating they have worked with the customer to ensure things are solved. A spokesperson from Amazon told : We’ve worked directly with the customer to make things right.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON AmazonCCTVCCTV footage\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Image: PAByAlahna KindredNews Reporter:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov A stepmum accused of murdering a boy has pleaded guilty part-way through her trial to cruelly beating the six-year-old. Emma Tustin, who is also accused of killing stepson Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, changed her plea to the count of child cruelty today. The boyaposs father Thomas Hughes, , and Tustin, are both on trial accused of murder after Arthur suffered an unsurvivable brain injury in June . Tustin, , is alleged to have carried out the fatal assault while Arthur was in her care. She took a photo on her mobile phone of the little lad as he lay dying in the hallway of her home in Solihull, West Midlands, jurors at Coventry Crown Court have been told. Tustin previously pleaded guilty on the first day of the trial to another count of child cruelty - ill-treating Arthur on multiple occasions by forcing him to stand, isolating him within the family home, and physically or verbally intimidating him.  Hughes is accused of aiding and abetting in the murder, including by sending a text message to Tustin before Arthuraposs fatal collapse telling her kidaposs getting ended when I get back. Prosecutors have alleged the pair carried out a campaign of cruelty, amounting to torture, against Arthur, in which he was force-fed salt-laced meals, kept isolated in the home, starved, dehydrated and routinely beaten. Mary Prior QC, Tustinaposs barrister, told jurors her client had admitted in her own evidence to three assaults... all captured on CCTV, occurring between June  and  , leading to her change of plea.  Tustin claimed Arthuraposs fatal head injury was self-inflicted, possibly by throwing himself down the staircase in her hallway, where he was forced to spend  to  hours a day, the court heard. During his evidence, Hughes claimed Tustin mentally abused and gaslighted him into complying with the punishing disciplinary regime, but also admitted lying to school staff who were checking on Arthuraposs progress during the first Covid- lockdown. Today, the jury heard the last of the evidence in Hughesapos defence, including from a woman who shared a cell with Tustin while she was awaiting trial for Arthuraposs murder.  Elaine Pritchard was Tustinaposs padmate at HMP Eastwood Park in Gloucestershire in November . She said she trashed the cell and ordered Tustin out after reading that Arthur had suffered about  separate injuries. Ms Pritchard, , told jurors she has an extensive record of offending linked to drug and alcohol abuse, including assaults and drink-driving. Ms Pritchard was asked about an argument she had while sharing a cell with Tustin, which ended with her calling the prisonaposs guards to have her cellmate removed. In evidence, she said she had spotted Tustinaposs case paperwork lying on a side table.  She said: I saw a comment from the paramedics, and  bruises. On his body. And that she showed no emotion. Bernard Richmond QC, representing Hughes, asked: How did she know that you had seen that  Ms Pritchard replied: Because I ended up throwing her out of the cell. She added: I asked her, why wouldnapost she know that a boy had all those injuries  I asked her about when she had bathed him or showered him. She said aposOh, I didnapost do that, I just used to give him a towelapos. I was quite angry at the fact someone had  bruises on their body.  Asked what Tustin did when Ms Pritchard got angry, she claimed: She was sat on her bed or on the chair, with her knees up, and I just started throwing her stuff into the corner of the room, saying aposYouaposre getting out, youaposre goingapos. I pressed the alarm bell for the staff, I feared I would end up staying in the prison. Ms Pritchard then alleged in court: She said to me aposYou had your kids taken off youapos and I said aposYeah, I did, but youaposre not going to get your kids back, youaposve murdered a little boy, youaposve killed a boyapos. She wasnapost interested the only thing she spoke about was her own children, she never spoke about Arthur. Hughes denies a charge of child cruelty through ill treatment, as well as a further child cruelty allegation of wilfully assaulting Arthur on multiple occasions. The pair also both deny allegations of child cruelty by administering salt to Arthur between June  and  last year, and by withholding food and drink.

She was too weak to drink so was given a piece of wet kitchen roll to suckJoan Massey waited on the floor for  hours for ambulance to arrive after she fell down Image: SWNSByAlahna KindredNews Reporter:,  Nov | commentsA blind woman who was left lying on the floor waiting for an ambulance for nearly  hours was forced to suck a tissue for moisture. Joan Massey, , fell inside her Birmingham home on November , where a family member found her and called an ambulance at about am. She was unable to drink while on the floor and was given a wet kitchen roll to suck on by her family. The family said they eventually managed to spoon water into her mouth as they waited  hours for help to arrive. West Midlands Ambulance Service has since apologised and said it is dealing with high levels of demand. Wendy Massey, , who is Joanaposs daughter-in-law, said: She was on the ground for more than  hours.  Though we have no idea actually how long she was down before that. She does wear a helpline around her neck, but being in the situation she had clearly forgotten she had it. She added: Helen Brooks [my sister-in-law] rang  at about quarter past ten, and was with her the whole time. Obviously Joan was uncomfortable for a lot of that time and wanted to move and needed the loo, which is dficult because in that situation you canapost be moved. Sheaposs a blind lady. So she was in a dark world all that time and not knowing what was happening to her. Her hearing is extremely poor as well. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.Wendy said her husband went up around pm - seven hours later - and rang the ambulance again. She added: He had to feed her some water with a wet bit of kitchen roll because she was in such an awkward position and so uncomfortable. Eventually he used a teaspoon to feed her some sparkling water after she became very thirsty. Each time we phoned the ambulance they said they were very sorry and that they were busy. We know that and donapost expect special treatment - I understand fully that other emergencies take priority. But  hours! Weaposre actually only about  minutes away from the main Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. She really looked like a frail old lady at that point. My husband called the paramedics again. She continued: It was about quarter past eleven at night when the paramedics knocked on the door. They dealt with her very quickly. They checked her over and didnapost think anything was obviously broken. Then they popped out this lilo thing and transferred her - with her screaming in pain sadly, and she isnapost a lady to complain. Wendy alleges that since being admitted to the hospital there had been continual failures in communication between the hospital and the family, leading to confusion over where and how she is. She said: She has since had an X-ray to seeanything is broken, which happened on Thursday, and apparently the doctor was supposed to call on Saturday, but nobody has yet. When Joan arrived at the hospital, doctors apparently discovered she was suffering from a urinary infection, which is a common cause of falls among elderly people. Joan has since gone through treatment and her daughter Helen is in contact with the hospital on her condition.A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: “We would like to apologise to Mrs Massey and her family for the delay in responding. “Unfortunately, the whole of the NHS remains under severe pressure which is being felt intensely in our service in the West Midlands hospital handover delays, unfortunately, mean patients are waiting longer for an ambulance response. Unfortunately, we were also dealing with high levels of demand from people with le-threatening conditions. We are working with all local partners across the health and care system to reduce delays so crews can respond to the next incident as quickly as possible and staff and volunteers continue to work tirelessly to respond as soon as we can.“We are continuing to bolster frontline and control room staffing and have introduced a number of measures to help manage pressures in the service.

The nine-year-old dog loves walks, cuddles and attention, and nearly hit the jackpot when a potential owner showed interest in the lurcher last weekend. But the adoption fell through after years of failed rehoming attempts. The poor pooch hasn’t got it statistically easy, with black dogs typically being more dficult to rehome, and lurchers often end up in shelters.  Dillon has never lived with or walked with another dog before his owner’s death, and during his time at the Cornish rescue, has seen countless other dogs come and go while he patiently waits his turn. The Lurcher, who is a young dog at heart, was taken into a shelter at the National Animal Welfare Trust when he was found protecting and watching over his elderly owner after they passed away. After a trial living with another dog, it was clear this wasnapost going to be an option as Dillon is too used to being an only child to share. Following the trial he was back at the centre again, and it was time to try and find him a new owner based in Cornwall and more have fallen through in that time.

In an update posted this weekend, National Animal Welfare Trust said the team was absolutely devastated to share the news that Dillon would be staying with them a little longer. Through no fault of his own the customer decided they would wait for a Labrador as they don’t usually own lurchers and one that could play with family dogs that visit, they wrote, saying that most people who had enquired already had other pets, which would not be suitable.Amy Hall, Fundraising and Supporter Relations Officer for NAWT, says he is a deeply loving and affectionate pet. She said: Heaposs a really great dog, but he just needs the right person. Weaposve had a few people interested but for one reason or another theyaposve not quite worked out. The thing with his age is he attracts people looking for more of a dog that sits with you, whereas Dillon in his heart is still a bit of a puppy. He will settle down with you and relax too, but he likes to go out in the fields and have a nice walk - after which he likes to just chill.

The booster rollout will be offered in order of ascending age groups and has been sped up to reflect growing concern over the impact of the new Covid iant Omicron on a potential wave of infections. The announcement prompted thousands to attempt to register for a booster vaccine appointment on the NHS website. People waited in a queue to access the booking page, with , held in a virtual line ready to book.  By Monday night the NHS website had updated to reflect the new guidance, but said that the JCVI’s plans to offer a booster dose to everyone aged  years old and over was “not yet available”. Many people who waited in the virtual queue found themselves unable to register for a vaccine appointment despite being newly eligible.One person wrote on Twitter : They told me I could book my booster but when I tried it said I was th on the queue and when I got to the front they said, no sorry, not eligible.”When a Daily Mirror journalist under the age of  attempted to register, despite receiving their second dose almost six months ago, they were told they were not yet eligible, despite fitting the new criteria.

One couple in their s, Brian Bull and his partner Jenner, said they encountered dficulties booking their boosters because of confusing instructions on the NHS website. Mr Bull, , was due for his jab nearly a month ago but has been repeatedly turned away from his local clinic in Appleby, Cumbria. He said: “The NHS website said there was a walk-in centre at Penrith. We drove the  miles only for the receptionist to say she knew nothing about it.” In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department for Health said: “The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationpreviously advised that those aged over  years and those at higher risk from coronavirusshould be offered a booster.“This new JCVI advice means those aged  to  will also be eligible for a booster when the NHS calls them forward. The booster will be offered in order of descending age groups, with priority given to the vaccination of older adults and those in a COVID- at-risk group. “In response to the changing risk posed by the Omicron iant, the booster will now be given no sooner than  months after the primary course. In addition, a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID- vaccinefor young people aged  to  years is advised no sooner than  weeks after the first dose.

The next day, Essex County Council announced that contact tracers were focusing on iniduals who had attended the branch KFC, as well as those who had visited a local church.

Recognisable worldwide and an emblem of British society, we are used to seeing Her Majesty in brightly coloured outfits carrying out official engagements. And in her time on the throne, the world has drastically changed - including the powers she actually has. We might think the Queen doesnapost have any real clout, as this goes to the government and Prime Minister instead. But she has several surprising abilities from the randomto the paramount , though she rarely exercises this.As the Queen has been forced to scale back her duties as she recovers from a sprained back, itaposs often wonderedshe will pass the baton onto her son, Prince Charles.This is unlikely, but it has left many people thinking about the powers the Queen actually has. Owning the swans, whales and dolphins Get the news you want straight to yourinbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. As the song goes, Rule Britannia, Britannia rule the waves. Well, the Queen does actually technically rule whataposs underneath them. In a centuries-old tradition, she owns all of the unclaimed mute swans in open water in England and Wales, but only actually exercises ownership on certain stretches and tributaries of the River Thames around Windsor. This bizarre legislation was created back in the s, when swans were coveted as fancy food in banquets and feats, and rights of ownership were granted by the Queen to a select and lucky few. Hundreds of years ago, swans were carefully guarded and counted, and there were severe penalties for killing or injuring one - and you could even face prison for stealing an egg. Swans are no longer eaten today and are in fact a protected species - it was legally treasonous to eat them right up until .  Itaposs not treason any moreyou injure a swan, but you could be fined up to £, - andyou kill one you could even be imprisoned for up to six months. Aside from the Queen, there are only three organisations also allowed to own swans - Abbotsbury Swannery since the th Century, and the Vintners and the Dyer since the th Century. Itaposs not just the swans that Her Majesty owns - since , she also technically claims all the sturgeons, whales, and dolphins in the waters around England and Wales, andyou catch one and want to sell it, as a gesture of loyalty you must make a request to the Queen. And the rule has been put into practice recently, too. In , a Welsh fisherman was investigated by the police after catching a -foot sturgeon - but the Palace decreed he could keep it. Driving without a license, and travelling without a passport  Our driveraposs licenses are issued in the Queenaposs name - so doesnapost actually need one in order to drive. The Queen also doesnapost technically need a number plate on her car, either. However, she does carry a license anyway, having learnt to drive back in World War II, when she operated a first-aid truck for the Womenaposs Auxillary Territorial Service aged . She also loves surprising people with her driving abilities - taking King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, then a prince, for a spin around Balmoral in . As instructed, the crown prince climbed into the front seat of the front Land Rover, with his interpreter in the seat behind. To his surprise, the Queen climbed into the driving seat, turned the ignition and drove off, wrote Former British Ambassador Sherard Cowper-Coles in the Sunday Times. Women are not - yet - allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia, and Abdullah was not used to being driven by a woman, let alone a queen. Cowper-Coles added: His nervousness only increased as the Queen, an army driver in wartime, accelerated the Land Rover along the narrow Scottish estate roads, talking all the time. Through his interpreter, the crown prince implored the Queen to slow down and concentrate on the road ahead. And the jet-setting Queen doesnapost need to remember to pack a passport when she flies, as they are issued in her own name so she does not require one. Choosing the Poet Laureate  The Poet Laureate is an honorary position appointed by the monarch of the United Kingdom, currently on the advice of the prime minister. There is an expectation that the holder will write for signicant national occasions. Currently, the role is held by Simon Armitage, who the Queen chose to succeed Carol Ann Duffy in May . The poets tend to serve for ten years before they are replaced. Signing and vetoing laws Before any bill becomes law, it must be approved by the Queen. Once a proposed law has passed both houses of Parliament, it comes to the Palace for approval - something called Royal Assent. Royal Assent is dferent to Queenaposs consent, which means the Queen must consent to any law being debated in Parliament that affects her own interests.According toin , Royal Assent has been exercised more than , times as the Queen or Prince Charles vetted laws before they were approved by parliament.They included matters ranging from justice, social security, pensions, race relations and food policy through to obscure rules on car parking charges and hovercraft. There was even one instance [in which] the Queen completely vetoed the Military Actions Against Iraq Bill in , a private memberaposs bill that sought to transfer the power to authorise military strikes against Iraq from the monarch to parliament, the publication wrote. Representatives refused to comment on how many times she had requested alterations to legislation during her reign. Creating Lords, knights, and forming the government  The Queen personally presents citizens who have made a special contribution to society with honorary titles, including damehoods and knighthoods. On the advice of elected government ministers, she can also appoint Lords who sit in parliament.Until , the Queen could also dissolve Parliament and call a general election, but now a two-thirds vote in the commons is required to do this before a five-year fixed-term is up.In a general election, she will usually appoint the MP with the majority support of voters and the House of Commons. Andthe PM resigns, the Queen will consult her advisors on who should succeed them. The Queen is also the Colonel-in-chief of the armed forces, presiding over military ceremonies and appointing new archbishops, bishops, and deans as the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. She can also declare war, grant royal pardons, and requisition civilian ships for military usethe need ever arises - though this decision would be made by the PM.Not paying taxThe Queen is not legally required to pay tax, but she has been voluntarily paying income tax and capital gains tax since . And in the unlikely event sheaposs short of cash, the Queen can pop down to the private ATM in the basement of Buckingham Palace, provided by prestigious bank Coutts. Exemption from Freedom of Information requests and prosecution  After a legal battle withover letters Prince Charles sent to Whitehall ministers, the Royal Family won the right to become exempt from Freedom of Information requests.These black spider memo documents were eventually released in  after a ten-year legal fight - but this kind of thing wonapost happen again now there is the current ruling.Not only that, the Queen is immune from prosecution and cannot be compelled to give evidence in court. Her website explains: Although civil and criminal proceedings cannot be taken against the Sovereign as a person under UK law, the Queen is careful to ensure that all her activities in her personal capacity are carried out in strict accordance with the law. If the Queen did break the law, she would likely be forced to abdicate. Firing the Australian government  The Queen is the head of state in Australia, meaning she has powers over the government. Back in , her representative Government General Sir John Kerr fired Prime Minister Gough Whitlam after a government shutdown due to lack of funding in a row over the budget. It has since been described as the greatest political and constitutional crisis in Australian history. Kerr appointed a replacement, Malcolm Fraser, who immediately passed the spending bill to fund the government. Three hours later, Kerr dismissed the rest of Parliament and Australian citizens voted for their representatives from scratch. The Queen is also the head of state in several Commonwealth Realms or former British colonies, though itaposs mostly a ceremonial role. This includes Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu.

Ian McPherson planned a weekend trip to Crimdon Dene Holiday Park near Hartlepool with his family for his th birthday. He travelled to the park on Friday with his we Kerry, , children Robbie, , Daniel, , Ella, seven, and their French bulldog Bella. Ian said that after they went to bed the wind was so strong that they feared for their lives and tried to go home. However they were advised not to drive during the storm and instead spent the night on the floor of the site office. The self-employed builder said: When I looked out the window I saw a caravan and it was floating down the hill on its gas bottle. It was almost like the gas bottle was its wheels. I walked towards it and looked around. At that point I decided to get in my car.  It was like something out of Mad Max. I thought it was the end of the world, thataposs what it felt like. I thought our time was up. Ian said that the strong winds started when they went to bed during their first night at the park. He said: It felt like really bad turbulence. We were all scared to go into the front part of the caravan. The fire was physically moving in the wall backwards and forwards and the caravan started bouncing. We were lying in bed thinking itaposs going to blow over. My daughter was lying in bed cuddling in to me. She was so frightened. I was saying itaposs OK but I was petried.  Ian said they attempted to leave the site after noticing the damage which was being caused to caravans around them. A number of holiday homes were ripped apart during the night and a member of the security team was taken to hospital. Ian said he went to the site office with his family during the early hours of the morning. He said a member of staff advised against him driving back to their home in Chester-le-Street, County Durham. The dad-of-three said: We went to the site office and we sat on one of the office floors. We went up to the site office at about half past four in the morning and stopped there until eight oaposclock.  Ian said that he was then told to collect his belongings from his caravan on Saturday morning and evacuate the site. The trip, which was supposed to last until Monday, had been his first visit to Crimdon Dene. Ian said they planned to watch the Newcastle United match and go into Hartlepool for an Indian meal. We were all there as a family. We never do anything as a family, even the dog was there! Ian said it was simply pot luck that the caravan they were staying is did not suffer serious damage like others on the site and added: It was horrendous.  It was a shock to see caravans overturned. I just feel so lucky that wasnapost us. A spokesperson for Crimdon Dene Holiday Park said yesterday: A number of caravans have been damaged as a result of Storm Arwen, and we are in touch with any owners affected. One member of our security team on park has been taken to hospital as a precaution after injuring his knee, and we are making sure he has whatever support he needs.The park is currently closed, and due to the dangerous weather causing a threat to le, everybody should adhere to Met Office guidance and stay away from the park for the time being.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Met OfficeStorms\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The couple stepped down as senior royals at the beginning of  and have since carved out a le for themselves and their children Archie and Lilibet in Calornia, after leaving the UK.And now royal biographer Andrew Morton, who has penned the unauthorised book Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, says that the couple felt they didnapost get the support they wanted from the Firm.Speaking to the Express, Mr Morton, who famously wrote Diana: In Her Own Words, said: They are popular and what they found dficult to accept was that inside the Royal Family itaposs not about popularity, itaposs about the position. Harry was lower down the totem pole, and so too was Meghan. They didnapost get the funding they wanted, they felt they didnapost get the support they wanted.Mr Morton likened their situation to the Queenaposs late sister Princess Margaret and her husband Lord Snowdon, who he says were incredibly popular in the Swinging Sixties but lower down the totem pole.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

It is hoped that the condition will run its course in a fortnight. “It’s now been over a week since my baby has let solid food touch her lips,” she said. “All my baby wants to do is suck her thumb and she can’t even do that. “Literally there’s nothing I can do to take her pain away. Nikki, the paramedic who runs the Tiny Hearts Instagram page, expressed empathy for the mum and daughter. Tiny Hearts said: ” is struggling to drink water because she’s in so much pain from blisters that have completely covered her mouth as a result of the cold sore virus. “My heart absolutely breaks for this family.got the virus at around the same age and I can honestly say it’s one of the most horrendous things to go through. “They can’t eat, they can’t sleep, they refuse medication because it causes more pain… they lose weight, they become dehydrated and can become really sick.  “I’ve spoken about the importance of normalising the sentence ‘don’t kiss my baby’ and although it’s unknown where little Ari picked up the virus, this is your reminder that protecting your little one with some simple rules will hopefully avoid this nightmare, and many other contagious viruses. “Prevention is better than cure so: “Educate your loved ones about the dangers of kissing a baby, ensure exceptional hand washing of you and everyone , limit bubaposs exposure to crowds and anyone with a cold sore or the virus, donapost let your little one share drinks, cutlery or toys and don’t allow anyone to put their fingers in bubs’ mouth.” The HSV-, cold sore or herpes virus can all easily be passed onto babies and toddlers through contact such as a kiss. In the worst case scenario they can prove fatal. It is a chronic long-term condition, which can become active again. Herpes is especially dangerous for babies under six months old and newborn babies because their immune systems are still developing.

Alissia Way, who lives in Wrexham, Wales, with her three children, including her seven-week-old son, said sheaposs been left without any power since Friday following a power cut caused by the storm.The young mum said she has begged for help as she has had no other choice but to wrap her children up in extra layers to keep them warm as SP Energy Network said would not be able to receive any extra help.She told Wales Online : “I explained that I’ve got a seven-week-old-baby and I’m struggling to keep him warm.“They basically just told me to deal with it.  “The hotels are all full, and we’re basically just stuck in this situation. I just think they should have organised some sort of accommodation.” Alissia said her power supply went off shortly before midnight on Friday night and claims she was told by SP Energy Networks that power would be back by Saturday. However, as of Sunday night, Alissia and her family are still stuck without electricity or gas. “All I want is for the kids to be warm, she said. “I’m not happy because he [seven-week-old son Kaleb] is basically a newborn baby and obviously there are other families with young babies, and it’s not fair on them. She added: “I’ve had to put him in his coat and things like that, and we haven’t been able to sterilise his bottles properly.”  Another problem is the fact that the family’s fridge is currently without power, meaning that their food has spoiled.

Linda Elsworth, , is one of several tenants on Wordsworth Drive in Oulton, near Leeds, who have been issued eviction notices that require them to be out of their homes by December . But the deadline is now imminent, and Linda says she has nowhere to gosheaposs evicted next week - and evenshe did aposit wouldnapost be the sameapos.Linda, originally from Hornsea, told LeedsLive : I paid for this out of my own pocket and made the place my home and my community. I was comfortable in thinking this would be my forever home, and now the rugaposs been pulled from under us and itaposs not.Itaposs a little bit disheartening because I spent most of my savings to make this my home and now itaposs all going to be taken away from me.  Itaposs devastating. Itaposs like losing your family. The thought of being homeless is scary - especially at this time of year. The eviction notice comes from landlord Pemberstone - who have been planning to redevelop the estate since , and have now got the ball rolling with eviction notices to the eight most aposstructurally unsoundapos houses on the estate. Linda, a retired administrator, moved to the Sugar Hill estate comprising Wordsworth Drive and Sugar Hill Close, six and a half years ago after her marriage broke down. Her house is decked out in her two favourite things, which she calls aposobsessionsapos, owls and the colour purple - collections sheaposs built up to make the place her own. Linda said: Iaposm having to pack up all my boxes, with all my memories. Iaposve got to decide which bits to get rid of - because there wonapost be room for them wherever I go.  After several years of the estate fighting Pemberstoneaposs application to bulldoze the old mining estate - Linda and some of her neighbours received notice in August they would need to be out by December . I only have about four or five days - but thereaposs no way thataposs going to happen because Iaposve got nowhere to go, she said. Iaposm physically looking for places but there just isnapost anywhere - at least not anywhere that I could afford. The reason we all live here is because theyaposre affordable properties for people such as myself on a state pension and housing benefits and people on lower income.Iaposm extremely worried. My hairaposs started to fall out and my blood pressure is up and down all over the place. Iaposm not the healthiest person at the moment anyway. Itaposs not helping - the fact that Iaposve got to try and pack and move stuff around.I donapost know what to do. When Wednesday comes around and Iaposm going to have to say aposaposIaposm sorry Iaposm not moving because Iaposve got nowhere to goapos. When I moved here I was a lot healthier and able to do it, but now my health has deteriorated and my mobilityaposs gone and I need walking aids. I can manage keeping the house neat and tidy but having to pull it apart and move furniture and pack is just hard work. Lindaaposs next door neighbour has already moved out ahead of the eviction notice, and she says sheaposs felt aposa bit lostapos since they went. Leeds City Council originally denied Pemberstone planning permission to bulldoze the estate in  - but the decision was overturned the next year by the government.  The estate, campaigning as group Save Our Homes LS, urged the council to buy the estate and refurbish the houses, but they concluded it would be too expensive. A spokesperson from Leeds City Council said: The notices being served to residents of Sugar Hill Close and Wordsworth Drive in Oulton are from landlord Pemberstone, in accordance with national law. In terms of council support for the residents, Leeds Housing Options has contacted them with advice and assistance, and a surgery also took place in the community last week, both during the day and in the evening. A spokesman for Pemberstone added: An extensive survey of all  houses in  found that there was signicant structural damage and deterioration to  properties which threatens their overall structural stability. A follow-up survey in March this year found that they have continued to deteriorate. We, therefore, had to take the dficult decision to give notice to eight tenants who are on standard tenancy agreements. Of these, five are currently still in occupation. For the tenants who have to move, we have provided a four months’ notice period and have offered an ex-gratia payment equivalent to up to six months’ rent to help with relocation costs.

The video has emerged today and shows the group repeating the same line over and over again. Piers seems to be so enthusiastic about the embarrassing chant that he waves his arms at one point as though conducting. He is then seen ripping a sticker from the window which encourages passengers to wear masks.  After a while, the group begin chanting resist, defy, do not comply. Many have tweeted ridiculing the chat, which comes as the PM tightens rules on mask wearing on public transport. Jeremy Vine tweeted: This apossongapos only has one line, but Piers Corbyn keeps forgetting it.  Another commented: Grown adults. Well done really responsible. I know letaposs sing a little ditty in protest. Jesus wept no wonder we are where we are.

Prince Charles said he was touched to be invitedPrince Charles attends the transition in Bridgetown, Barbados Image: PAByRussell MyersRoyal editor:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsPrince Charles has acknowledged the barbaric transatlantic slave trade as Barbados celebrated becoming a republic. In a major speech, the Prince of Wales recognised Britain’s dark past which “forever stains our history”. As the Caribbean nation heralded a new dawn at midnight, replacing the Queen as head of state, Charles said he was touched to be invited despite the act of severance with his family. At National Heroes Square, Charles said: “The creation of this Republic offers a new beginning, but it also marks a point on a continuum – a milestone on the long road you have not only travelled, but which you have built. “From the darkest days of our past, and the appalling atrocity of slavery, which forever stains our history, the people of this island forged their path with extraordinary fortitude. “Emancipation, self-government and Independence were your way-points. Freedom, justice and self-determination have been your guides.”  The Queen had been Barbados’s head of state since its independence in , but a debate about becoming a republic has followed at national level since. Supporters said the birth of a republic, exactly  years on, unclasps colonial bonds that have been in place since an English ship claimed the tiny, unpopulated island for King James I in . Barbados received , enslaved Africans between  and , who worked in the sugar plantations and earned fortunes for the English owners. A senior palace source said the Prince was honoured to be involved in the handover and wanted to use the opportunity to “further recognise that the profound injustice of the legacy of the slave trade could never be forgotten”. Charles made similar sentiments on a  visit to Ghana, from where thousands were shipped off to a le of slavery. Britain had been part of the transatlantic slave trade for over  years by the time it was abolished in , although full abolition of slavery did not follow for another generation. Buckingham Palace had said the issue of republicanism was a matter for the people of Barbados to decide, as well as the other  realms where the Queen is head of state. The Barbadian government’s decision is likely to spur discussion of similar proposals in other former colonies such as Jamaica, Australia and Canada.Barbadian pop superstar Rihanna was among the leading figures to attend the ceremony.Service personnel marched past the prince and gave a final salute to the monarchy before the Queen’s standard was lowered and the presidential flag raised. Charles was due to receive the Freedom of Barbados and the Queen wrote a message wishing its people “happiness, peace and prosperity”. Referring to her first visit to “your beautul country” in , she said its people have “held a special place in my heart”, adding: “It is a country rightfully proud of its vibrant culture, its sporting prowess and its natural beauty.”The first president of Barbados is Dame Sandra Mason, the previous governor-general. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK and Barbados will remain “steadfast friends and allies”.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON The QueenPrince Charles, Prince of WalesBuckingham PalaceRoyal FamilyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And a new documentary has likened  to another aposannus horribilisapos for her after a tumultuous year. Not only did has she had to contend with the Covid pandemic like everyone , but sheaposs also lost her beloved husband Prince Philip, who died aged  in April. The monarch has also seen the fallout from Prince Harry and Meghan Markleaposs move to the United States and had to pull out of several engagements, including Remembrance Sunday, due to health issues. But on the documentary, experts say that this new aposannus horribilisapos will actually make the monarchy stronger. Charles Anson, the Queenaposs press secretary between  and , told the Channel  show: The strength of our monarchy is that it is able to adapt. Itaposs changing and I think providing the values are still there, it often changes for the better.

While documentary producer Stewart Purvis added: In the last year, the Queen has lost her husband [and] sheaposs got a grandson who is semi-detached. But she has symbolised so much of what we hope for from a royal family that, in a sense, I think the respect for her is stronger than ever. I think the future of the Royal Family is more secure as a result of the way sheaposs steered us through these dficult months. Last week it was reported that the Queen was looking forward to Christmas and her traditional family festive get together at her Norfolk estate of Sandringham.It is understood the Queen will travel to Sandringham on or around Friday, December . Royal sources said it was likely she would make a -minute helicopter journey from Windsor, but insisted a traditional journey by train from London to Kings Lynn had not yet been ruled out.  Christmas guests will include Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their three children.A source said: “The Queen has told everyone she is feeling far better of late and is very much looking forward to welcoming them for Christmas.“Like many other families, this will be the first time Her Majesty can gather with her extended family after being kept apart for so long due to the coronavirus pandemic.”Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON The QueenDocumentariesRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sarah Agbiji had a meeting with staff in the branch and took pal Renita Ruta along with her. But the pair claim they were forgotten about and left in one of the upstairs rooms of the Barclays. Sarah and Renita said they called the bank’s HQ and police, but were left stranded there until an employee came back with a key.Model Sarah slammed Barclays for the alleged security breach as they were allowed to stroll round the bank unchecked.Barclays has described it a an unfortunate accident.  They were told alarms would eventually go off, but the two pals said they were left hungry without any food for two hours.

But it was a dferent story for the owners of these dogs, who had a blast running around in the snow as it came down across the UK.The wholesome clips of the pups enjoying the winter weather were shared across Twitter - fromCilla the Labradoodlehaving a thorough roll in the snow in the East Midlands, toblack Lab Winstonbounding off down the icy road for a snow-fuelled adventure in Moray, Scotland.In Sheffield, it was poodle bichon frise cross Arthur’s first time seeing snow - and after an initial cursory snf the pup seemed to thoroughly approve, as the cute clip filmed by ownerAlexisshows him leaping through the snow and looking up at the sky in disbelief. Elsewhere in Sheffield,Ben the border colliedidn’t let a bit of weather deter him from his usual activities, as a clip shows him digging out a huge stick from the snow and proudly carrying it away. Aptly-named poodle Penguin seemed to have endless energy reserves in the East Midlands, as a video posted by his ownerTeresashows the hyper dog racing around in the fresh snowfall. While up in ScotlandLabradors Albert and Berasaw the dusting of white as more of a tasty snack than a playground, seen eagerly snaffling up snowballs that their owner tosses them.It wasn’t just this side of the pond that saw the weather turn over the weekend - dogs across the world were united in their love of snow.Golden retriever Gracieenjoyed a chilly roll in the snow in Ontario, Canada, and chihuahuas Niko and Milo were filmed by their ownerCheyanneenjoying their first ever snowfall in Toronto.

Necessary precautions have been taken to prevent further spread, the council said. The case is said to be well and isolating with family. Though they have some symptoms, they do not require hospitalisation. Essex County Council said in a series of tweets: Following further contact tracing of the known Omicron Covid- case in Brentwood, it has been confirmed that there is a link to Larchwood Primary School based in Pilgrims Hatch.  UK Health and Security Agency, Department of Health and Social Care, Larchwood Primary School and colleagues from Essex County Council and Brentwood Council have worked together to take necessary precautionary action to prevent the spread.

A person infected with the Omicron iant in Essex is well and isolating with their family, the regionaposs top public health official has said.Essex director of public health Dr Michael Gogarty told BBC Breakfast: Most importantly with the confirmed case is that they are well, they are isolating with their family.When I say that they are well, I mean they are not seriously ill. They have some symptoms but they do not require hospitalisation.  Students at the school are being tested for the new Omicron iant, the regionaposs top public health official said. Dr Gogarty said: What weaposre doing is weaposre throwing the net very wide in terms of requesting people who attended these places at the particular times to get tested as soon as possible. Within the school we are actually excluding one school group as close contacts, but with the rest of the school group we would wish them to get tested and we are arranging for that testing to happen. Some sought it yesterday, and the rest will happen today. A number of sites in Essex visited by a person infected with the Omicron iant are being targeted for testing, Mr Gogarty added. There are a number of sites we are looking at where these people had contact . One you would be aware of is the KFC in Brentwood. Thereaposs also a face setting and a school setting.

Unite  fight  With a flailing Boris Johnson and ided Tories running a tired government, unity and verve are needed for Labour to be in with a decent shout at the next election. Yesterday’s Labour reshuffle started badly with strains publicly exposed again between leader Keir Starmer and deputy Angela Rayner so the fresh team will be under the microscope during the next few weeks and months.

Heres everything you need to know about the new strainFace masks in shops and on public transport are once again required Image: AFP via Getty ImagesByBenjamin LynchSEO writer:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | comments A new strain of the coronavirus is causing concern - but how is it dferent to what we have seen before Doctors and scientists are working to learn more about the Omicron iant, which was first identied in South Africa.In response to the discovery of the new iant, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the reintroduction of some restrictions in public.People are now required to wear masks in shops and on public transport.Contacts of those with the Omicron iant are also being required to isolate for  days.PCR tests are effective in identying the strain and there is an expected announcement that the booster jab will become available to all UK adults.As well as this, any person arriving in the UK must take a PCR test on their second day and isolate until they have a negative result.Officials said this morning that six new cases were confirmed in Scotland and the UK announced its first three cases of the new mutant virus strain over the weekend.So what is the Omicron iant   What is the Omicron Covid- iant  Omicron is a mutated strain of the coronavirus. It is feared that compared to other strains, Omicron is more resistant to vaccines and more easily transmitted, but this has not been confirmed. Viruses are adaptable and this means that they develop over time due to genetic mutations also known as aposcopying errorsapos. Our immune systems are trained to recognise certain viruses and will produce antibodies in order to fight against them. Vaccines help to build up antibodies to protect us from specic viruses.  Mutations look slightly dferent to our antibodies and the part they use to attack other cells can change. This makes mutations harder for our antibodies to fight. The Omicron iant is shaped dferently to previous strains, making it dficult for our immune system to attack. It is reported that the general symptoms of the Omicron iant generally affect people with slightly dferent symptoms than the Delta iant.  How is Omicron dferent to the Delta iant  A doctor in South Africa explained that the Omicron clinical picture doesnapost fit Delta. Chair of the South African Medical Association Dr Angelique Coetzee, told AFP: We have seen a lot of Delta patients during the third wave. And this [Omicron] doesnapost fit in the clinical picture. Most of them are seeing very, very mild symptoms and none of them so far have admitted patients to surgeries. She said that symptoms of Omicron may be more likely to be extreme tiredness, a scratchy throat and mild muscle ache. As another general expectation, people are more unlikely to experience a loss of taste or smell.  What does Omicron mean  Like other iants, Omicron has been named by the World Health Organisation after a letter in the Greek alphabet. The first  letters of the alphabet have already been used to name dferent strains, which is why names such as aposAlphaapos, aposGammaapos and aposDeltaapos may sound familiar. Other iants have not been known to be as strong or effective, so are less famous.  The next letter, after the aposMu iantapos, was expected to be named after the letter aposNuapos. However, Nu and the following letter aposXiapos were skipped and the new iant is named after the next letter, aposOmicronapos. It has been reported that this was done to avoid confusion and for political reasons. Nu may have sounded like aposnew iantapos, which could have been confusing for people and Xi was avoided due to President Xi Jinping, current leader of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.

The British socialiteaposs lawyer Bobbi Sternheim, who has previously defended al-Qaeda terrorists and Mafia mob killers, painted a portrait of the billionaire paedophile Epstein in court. Maxwell, , is charged with recruiting, grooming and abusing four underage girls for her one-time boyfriend, who took his le in prison while before he could be tried on sex abuse charges. Today Sternheim told the court: “I said before Epstein was a manipulator, but he was also a mysterious man without attachment. He had no we. He had no children. And he had no boss. Yet he attracted all these rich and powerful people before and after his fall from grace back around . “In many regards, he was like a st-century James Bond. His mystery has stirred interest.”  She accused Epstein’s accusers of having shaken the “money tree” in terms of applying for compensation from his victim’s fund. Referring to the victim known in court as aposJaneapos, Sternheim says she refused to tell her story before and only came forward once the compensation scheme had been launched. “You will learn that Jane was in a beauty pageant,” Sternheim said. The lawyer said she modelled, sang, and travelled nationally and internationally from a young age as she attended auditions and even had an agent in New York. “Jane did take some flights on Epstein’s dime and she went to New York and some other places as well, she said. A month before Epstein’s arrest in , Jane did not want to be involved in any criminal case involving Epstein. But after Epstein died she changed her mind. When money was on the line she changed her mind.  She hired a lawyer. She became a client, got in touch with the government and said she changed her mind. “She is a consummate actress and is a pro at playing roles,” she said of the alleged victim. “As her scripts and characters changed, so has the story you will hear. “When money was on the line, she tagged Ghislaine. She got her application before the fund and she received  million. “Examine critically Sternheim urged the jury. If convicted on all six counts, Maxwell, who was wearing a white turtleneck and dark trousers while supported in court by her older sister Isabel, faces a maximum of  years in prisonthe sentences are to be served consecutively.  It would effectively see the socialite, a pal of Prince Andrew, handed a le sentence and dying behind bars.

That’s what happened to one woman on Reddit, who said she had been allowing her neighbours to use her driveway for their cars because she doesn’t own a vehicle herself so had no use for the space. And while things had been going well for a while, she became annoyed with her neighbours after they refused to move one of their cars to make space for a taxi that was bringing her brother home from the hospital. She explained: “I don’t have a car and the house I bought a couple years ago came with a drive large enough for two cars.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. “My next-door neighbours have always been allowed to use my drive because I didn’t need it. It really didn’t bother me becauseI had friends over then I’d just ask them to move, and they would. “I currently live with my -year-old brother who has very weak joints and has to go to hospital every month or so on average. A couple of months ago he tore the one in his knee and had to be on crutches. “We were pulling into our street in the taxi after leaving hospital and one of my neighbours pulled into my drive, blocking our taxi from pulling up to the door. “We waited for them to realise my brother had crutches and move but she looked at us and carried on inside, along with her sisters and stepdad. I had to hobble my brother across wet muddy grass to get to our door.”  The woman said she was left so incensed by her neighbour’s actions that she took back her offer to let them use her driveway. But now, several members of the household have welcomed children and have started parking in her drive again, so they don’t have to walk to their house with their baby carriers. And when the woman tried to confront them, she was slammed as “heartless” for being rude to a new mother. She wrote: “I was so angry I then told my neighbours that they were no longer allowed to use my drive. They protested, saying they had three cars and a van and had nowhere to park. I sympathised but still said no. My own brother couldn’t use his drive when he couldn’t even walk thanks to their nastiness.  “In the past three months, three of the residents’ children have had babies and have started parking on my drive again. I know why. Because they’d have to walk two blocks otherwise with baby carriers. “One of these girls confronted me, telling me that I don’t even need the drive and that it’s heartless to do that to a new mother. Her sister backed her up. “I replied that it was also heartless to make my brother walk across dangerous grass when he was on crutches and in agony.” The woman then said she knows her actions are “petty”, but she doesn’t want to budge because they were cruel to her brother. She added: “I was neighbourly until they caused me not to be. I know I am being petty and vindictive in my reasoning, but I feel I am justied as I did them a courtesy for years by letting them use my drive only for them to treat my brother so cruelly.” And commenters on Reddit agreed with the woman, insisting she can use her driveway however she likes. One person said: “What idiots! They had a good thing going, much better than they deserved, and messed it up just through thoughtlessness.” While another added: “They’re mad they don’t get to take advantage anymore. Don’t let up, and good for you for making sure your brother can get inside easily.” What do you think  Let us know in the comments below.

Nowadays there are all sorts of apps to contend with, and tips and tricks to find a partner. Tinder is the place people usually turn to when desperate and in need of some sort of affection. You get the app on your phone, you make an account, you add some pictures , you try and come up with the quirkiest bio and then - boom - profile done.You start swiping, left for no, right for yes. Then comes the messaging, either you or the other person starts with a Hello, and you go from there.Now the scary part is actually setting up a date. After a couple of days of exchanging messages, you’re going to want to meet this ‘prince charming’. Or at least that’s what I thought.  It was around March this year when, after a bad break up, I decided to jump back on the dating wagon. After a couple of weeks of just ‘window shopping’ and being too scared to commit to any of the plans I was making with all these guys, I started talking with the man I thought was going to be ‘the one’. Beautul blue eyes, nice curly brown hair, his bio said ft tall. Honestly, every heterosexual girl’s dream. So, I took my chances. I messaged him first, something girls don’t tend to do very often. Our conversation started like any other we talked for hours and got to know each other, so we moved the conversation on to Snapchat. A couple of days went by, we kept messaging each other and worked out that we had more things in common than we first thought. And so we set up a date.  The original plan was to meet up by the pier, go watch the sunset, and then get some food at a restaurant near there. When the big day came, I put on a nice outfit, applied my makeup, grabbed my bag and was on my way. I met up with him by the pier, but instead of us going to the beach like weaposd originally agreed, he said he had a better place in mind. We took a left and strolled to some small hills, with the forlorn view of some excavators and barren rocks.  We sat down on a bench and started talking. From the start the conversation was weird - he started telling me about his Satanist flatmate from uni. It was a very weird curveball as that wasn’t related to the original topic. Then all of a sudden, he started throwing all these insults at me, about how I am an ‘idiot’ and a bit too ‘chubby’ for him. All of this while he gradually closed the gap between us on the bench. When he told me he didn’t like girls who smoke, I saw that as my silver lining.  I lit one cigarette and he seemed to back off, but just when I finished, he grabbed my shoulders and forced my face close to his. In that moment I knew that the only thing left for me to do is to message my friends. Luckily one of them called me immediately with our code - her boyfriend had broken up with her and I needed to head back ASAP. I told him so and went to leave. After an awkward goodbye, and me getting home, he saw my Snap Maps was on and asked to pick me up to go out with him and his friends. That’s when I blocked him. Moral of the story: online dating is scary, and for me this could have easily taken a turn for the worst. Itaposs made me more hesitant about who I put my trust in for future dates.

The palace is located next to Konstantinovsky Palace, President Putin’s seaside residence and was owned by Grand Duke Mikhail Nikolaevich, the son of Russian Emperor, Nicholas the First. Dmitry, , documented his trip, photographing the desolate property. In one image, a large room with a scratched high ceiling is pictured as light beams through the three archways in the centre of the room. In another, a staircase drops down onto a lower floor that has red and black etchings across the wall.  Above the staircase are two sculptures, along with a piece of artwork that shows a screaming skull. Other shots show the foot of a broken statue leaning against a pole, while other angles show the remains of the broken statue. As the palace is still protected by private security, Dmitry had to sneak past security guards to gain access. Luckily for him, he didn’t meet a single guard – but the building itself still remains dficult to access due to construction restrictions.  “All the doors and windows of the palace were boarded up, so it was dficult to find the entrance,” Dmitry said. “I went during the day, because I wanted to take good photos. Several caryatid sculptures have been preserved outside, and inside you can see the broken plaster statues of lions that are used to guard the main entrance. “The original mouldings on the walls and ceiling have also been preserved, but in general, the interior is completely destroyed.  “From the roof, you can see the Government highway for Saint-Petersburg, as well as the Gulf of Finland far on the horizon. “It was easy for me to imagine how great balls and high-society receptions took place in this palace and even how there was a rest house for Soviet working people here. “Decay, rust and a thick layer of dust from construction debris, as well as scraps of electrical wiring, broken tiles and broken interior doors and windows remain. “[On another wall] is etched: ‘For those who are afraid, there is no entrance.’ “[The palace] is not well-known or in a secret location – just located too far from the centre of the city, so there are no tourists, only a few locals who visit.  “Of course there were concerns [about being caught] but it is unlikely that I would have been shot or put in jail. They could have kept me with the police for several hours or fined me.” In , two buildings based on the palace grounds of Mikhailovskaya Dacha were bought and allocated for Grand Duke Mikhail, before being torn down in . Nicholas the First instructed an architect to design a new palace, which was finished in  – but it was ruined during World War  along with many other buildings. In , the estate was given to Kirovsky Plant and was partially restored in the s as a recreation centre, but closed its doors in the s  Dmitry said: “In the s, when Russia lost in the Cold War, the country was in complete ruin and the economy was in decline. “There was no money in the budget and not only were architectural monuments destroyed, but also factories and enterprises. “Small restoration was carried out, which is noticeable on the roof – but as always, money ran out or perhaps it was stolen. The building now stands completely destroyed and abandoned.” In July , the palace grounds were given to St. Petersburg State University, as a place to put their graduate school of management. However, this restoration hasn’t yet been completed and the building still stands abandoned.

Dr Coetzee told the AFP that she alerted health officials of a clinical picture that doesnapost fit Delta on  November when seven patients showed dferent symptoms that seemed very much related to normal viral infection. What is Omicron   The Omicron strain, or B..., is a super mutant iant which has  genetic mutations, over  of them being spike protein mutations. With traits seen in previous iants as well as three new changes that have never been seen before, scientists have expressed worry over Omicronaposs transmissibility and ability to evade immunity from vaccines and previous infections. What are the symptoms of Omicron Dr Coetzee told the BBC that the symptoms of Omicron are mild.She said her patients presented with extreme tiredness, mild muscle aches, scratchy throat and dry cough. Unlike the previous iants, this one doesnapost cause loss of taste or smell, she added.  The World Health Organisationsaid that initially reported infections were among university students exhibiting mild illness, adding that the severity of the iant won’t be clear until days or even weeks from now. How is it dferent to the Delta iant   Compared to the Delta iant, Dr Coetzee has said the symptoms are very, very mild, with no patients being admitted to surgeries over infections so far. She highlighted that most patients with Omicron could be treated at home. Though cases are not severe yet, Dr Coetzee warned: What we have to worry about is older, unvaccinated people.

Star failed to clear the danger from a cross and the unfortunate Coll McCallum erted into his own net past Leon Murphy.The Arthurlie equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when winger Sean Ross cut inside before unleashing a spectacular effort into the top corner.The hosts would have been expected to go on and win the game from here but the Star defence remained well-organised and resolute and a fine goalkeeping performance from Leon Murphy ensured the Lochgilphead side ed home with a well-earned point.Star put their unbeaten league record on the line on Saturday November  when they welcome fellow Argyll side Cardross to the Joint Campus G.

It initially took us away from the lakeside but it kept our dog safe from the toxic algae which we were concerned may still be present in the water. Our kids tend to vanish when we enter a wood, their laughter telling us they are playing somewhere close by but out of sight. Such was the case on this day as we meandered up the hill, exploring and admiring the views.A roe deer suddenly bolted from the undergrowth in front of us, taking us all by surprise. It must have been watching us approach, standing still and unseen in the nearby undergrowth. I wonderedwersquod have seen it at allit hadnrsquot decided to run away.Although it was late November, the tree canopy still had a patchwork of autumn colour. The colours were made more vivid when the sun began to set, casting a stream of golden rays through the wood, and for a moment making the lake sparkle. Such moments canrsquot be planned, just enjoyed and appreciated when they happen.Then we heard wild screams from the younger kids. ldquoFaery apples! was the cry. Tiny apples, the size of cherries, carpeted the ground. They had never seen such small apples and came running holding handfuls of them, wonderingthey could eat them.I explained they were crab apples, fallen from the crab apple tree which grew all twisty near the path.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot eat them raw, I explained, ldquobut you can cook them and make crab apple jelly. The moment I said that, I knew Irsquod given myself a task. ldquoCan we make it tonight  was the predictable reply.I will be honest, I have never made crab apple jelly but there is a first time for everything and so we gathered a pile of the tiny apples.We spent more than three hours exploring the wood, finally reaching the end of the lake after many detours and explorations. We took a lower path back to the car, but my we and I noticed something the kids didnrsquot: the sun was below the horizon and it would soon be dark. We hadnrsquot paid much attention to the time but the sun had given us some warning earlier on as it spread its final rays through the wood.We didnrsquot say anything lest the kids got spooked, but we tried to discreetly speed our step so we would reach the car park before it got completely dark. It wasnrsquot easy, as the kids played in the fallen leaves and explored side paths.Finally they noticed. ldquoItrsquos getting dark, one said.ldquoNo, it is dark! replied another.Indeed it was, although we could still see where we were going. The trees now had a dferent guise: dark silhouettes making eerie shapes in the imagination.Then it happened.The moon appeared in the cloudless sky, a nearly full moon, initially reddish in colour, then bright. It was a primeval experience, the lsquobeaver moonrsquo in the sky, lighting our way through an ancient wood. Our son did his best to spook his sisters with tales of werewolves but that just set off a crescendo of imitated wolf howling from them all. It certainly made them all feel much braver in the dark, moonlit wood.When we finally reached the car, I had a tinge of melancholy that we were leaving. But I was glad we had dallied and not noticed the sun disappearing. During our journey in the darkness, we could see the sky through the thinned tree branches in ways we cannot from home. The darkness played tricks on us but the wood felt enchanted most likely it really is.And that bright moon you might have seen it too.

Itrsquos almost impossible to believe that some of these creatures ever flitted from flower to flower, and indeed some of Jonesrsquos specimens do not ndash or no longer ndash accord with any known species the boldly barred Charaxes pelias may have been confused with something .There are familiar European butterflies here, skippers and arguses and fritillaries and admirals, all introduced formally in Latin rather than under their common or local names. Originally drawn at le-size, they help avoid the kind of scale-error that leads many of us to miss the smaller butterflies, like the little skipper or small blue, because they donrsquot fit our expectation of size.Butterfly hunting, and the kind of nerdy encounter documented a few years ago by Judith Hooper in Of Moths and Men, has long been caricatured as eccentric: middle-aged men in spectacles and baggy shorts galumphing round meadows with big catch-nets casting calls for Benny Hill or Charles Hawtrey.The actual work of entomologists like WilliamJones requires meticulous attention to detail and to tiny gradations of change now easily separated by macro photography and DNA analysis. The sheer intellectual as well as physical effort of gathering together a body of knowledge such as Icones cannot be underestimated, and nor can its collaborative nature, for every entry has a secret sharer in the name of the explorer and collector, be it Dru Drury or Sir Joseph Banks, James Edward Smith or John Francillon, who first recognised and gathered the specimens.A recent survey has shown that butterfly numbers in Britain have taken a further alarming e.

Wersquod be doubly shockedwe were able to experience again how rich and ied our insect le once was.COP probably didnrsquot spend much time on lepidoptera. Like White apparently, politicians almost certainly regard butterflies as less signicant than whales and tigers and struggling migratory birds. But they are, to mix metaphors, the coal mine canary of natural history and it would be depressing beyond beliefin  yearsrsquo time, the only place we could view these lovely things were through Jonesrsquos Icones, some of whom are, inevitably, extinct already."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13249532.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgow-summer-nights-bandstand-line-up-revealed","story":"The -date eventhas been cancelled for the past two years due to the pandemic but organisers Regular Music will be hoping it makes a sell-out toKelvingrove Bandstand in .Singer songwriter and political activist Billy Bragg and indie rock legendsPixies have been added to the revised line-up.Award-winning artist Laura Mvula will also perform as well as lively Stornoway three-piece Peat and Diesel.Other artists booked to appearincludeSuzanne Vega, who will kick-off the -date festival on July ,Richard Hawley and King Creosote performing From Summer with Love.Tickets are already sold-out for Van Morrison andThe Jesus  Mary Chain, Edwyn Collins and Altered Images ands pop staples Rick Astley and Belinda Carlisle.It marks afor the Pixies, who performed to a sell-out crowd in .

The next three weeks are going to be weeks of scientic uncertainty.\"Whilst we wait for the mist to clear on what this concerning new iant actually means, there is no time to delay - its our opportunity to get ahead and vaccine boosting is the thing we can do most easily whilst we wait for that science mist to clear.\"Boosters are already available to all adults aged  and over, as well as those with underlying health conditions.However, the decision to slash the timescale from six to three months will enable manyunder-s to get boosted before Christmas.Severely immunosuppressed patients, such as those having cancer treatment or organ transplant recipients, werealways due to for boosters six months after their third primary dose.However, on current timescales this would have left themwaiting until March or later - six months after that rollout gotunderway on September .Prof Van Tam said it was\"pretty likely\" based on mutations that Omicron will have some effect on vaccine efficacy, but biggest effect is likely to be on infection risk with \"hopefully smaller effects on severe disease\".He noted that there is an \"elevated growth rate\" for the virus in South Africa, but this is \"not the same as saying it is more transmissible than Delta\".Professor Wei Shen Lim, chair of the COVID- group for the UKs Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said that the large number of mutations present on the Omicron iantin comparison to the original Wuhan strain was a cause for concern.He said: \"The larger the mismatch between vaccine and iant the greater the likelihood that the level of protection provided by the vaccine will be lowered.\"From what we know of the Omicron iant so far, it may be that the vaccines we have at the moment may be less good than against the currently circulating Delta iant.\"Prof Lim stressed that evenprotection against infection is reduced, it was vital to \"raise level of immune response\" across population using boosters as thiswould still limit the impact of Omicron.He added that is was essential to do this early, ahead of a potential surge in cases.\"Should there be a wave we want to be in the best position,\" he said, adding: \"The majority of people who are aged  years and above are already eligible for a booster.\"Some of those who are already eligible have not yet received the vaccination.

Her talk of possible travel restrictions, aof indoor gathering controls and limitations, all on the back of only ndash at time of writing ndash six cases of the new iant in Scotland and no deaths as a result of it.Communicating what she does and how she does it, Nicola Sturgeon herself will be the cause of panic, distress and dangerous uncertainty, not the new Omicron iant.Paul McPhail, Glasgow.FLAWED DECISION TO DROP VALVENAOMICRON is now here in Scotland. And  million doses of a Scottish-made vaccine, Valvena, that would have been effective in fighting this dangerous new iant was cancelled by the UK Government just two months ago.Current vaccines, such as AstraZeneca, target the protein spikes, which are the parts of the virus that mutate. Valneva, by contrast, introduces a whole neutralised Covid virus into the body, not just the spike proteins, giving a broader immune response by increasing the memory cells that recognise all parts of the virus should infection occur.A year ago, former vaccine head Kate Bingham had ordered  million doses of Valneva, recognising its potential to provide a better immune response against future iants. The UK Government then cancelled the order, citing breach of contract, which Valneva denies. She called the abrupt cancellation inexplicable. Professor Adam Finn of JCVI is among several scientists urging the UK to reconsider Valneva. He said we need more than one vaccine option to deal with ldquoan unpredictable, dangerous iant like Omicron.One canrsquot help but suspect that the UK Governmentrsquos refusal to use Valneva was because of its Scottish French origins. Scotland is used to being dissed by Westminster, as we saw in the decision not to develop the shovel-ready Aberdeenshire carbon capture project. Only by ending an unequal Union that has served us so badly will we be able to make decisions that finally benefit Scotland.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh.AN EXCUSE FOR THE PMHOW convenient that a new iant of Covid- has emerged just in time to give Boris Johnson a good excuse for restoring the restrictions which he should never have removed in the first place the more cautious policy of our much-maligned Scottish Government has been clearly vindicated.Am I the only person who heard the interview with the South African doctor who first spotted the new iant  She explained that none of the patients affected by it had experienced anything more than mild symptoms and it was clear that she did not consider that any panic measures were required.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.LOSE THE SNP BY VOTING YESMAY I please reassure Michael Watsonthat the SNP-free Scotland he wishes may very well be available to him after, but only after, independence.Parties may change, but Mr Watsonrsquos right to vote for his choice will not, and like every other eligible voter, he will get the government the majority elect.Anent the rant from Douglas Coweagainst ldquogullible supporters of Nicola Sturgeon, and his dubious, unspecied statistics, it would be interesting to hear his views on the proportion of anti-Tory votes regularly cast for Westminster, under a much less representative system. He will find that the percentage voting against the Tories is consistently very much higher than recorded against the SNP here. Yet we have had Tory governments with sometimes huge majorities, on a vote share of less than %.His characterisation of SNP supporters as ldquogullible is an insult to the intelligence of a proven vast number of Scots. I suspect that the gullibility boot is on the other foot.P Davidson, Falkirk.CURRENCY CONFUSIONTHE SNP conference has once again supported the idea of a secessionist Scotland adopting its own currency, in spite of the manold dficulties that would create for people with mortgages and loans contracted in pounds sterling . This signals rank and file support for the plans of Dr Tim Rideout for a Scottish Reserve Bank. Yet the official SNP line remains that a separate Scotland would continue to use the pound for an unspecied time after any split with the UK. Nicola Sturgeon, her ministers and SNP elected members tell us that the Scottish public overwhelmingly favour retaining the pound. That is the message they hear on the doorsteps.So which is it  A party intent on putting a major constitutional choice before us must surely know which currency it intends to adopt  Or not Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh.* CONGRATULATIONS to the ordinary members of the SNP in conference last weekend who overwhelmingly endorsed the principle of establishing a Scottish Central Bank and currency following independence.This removes any further discussion on retaining sterling and the Establishment trappings advocated by Alex Salmondrsquos Council of Economic Advisors in  and the Charlotte Street lobbyists who concocted the suicide pill called the Growth Commission Report in .Perhaps now the several \"alternative monetary policy\" groups will receive some long overdue encouragement in their work of drafting Scotlandrsquos banking regulations and paving the way to re-establishing Scotlandrsquos international reputation for fair, equitable and mutual financial institutions.RF Morrison, Helensburgh.NOTHING FOR JOHNSON TO FEARWELL, well, well, therersquos a surprise. The SNP is to table a motion of censure on Boris Johnson . This is standard nationalist deflection tactics and clearly an attempt to reassure the troops and take attention away from the fact that its dream is even further off than it was .Its censure motion on the Prime Minister is a bigger joke than even Mr Johnson. He is unlikely to be quaking in his shoes.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh.Read more: If our politics are broken, donrsquot overlook the Toriesrsquo contribution"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13251058.jpg?type=article-full","title":"hampden-site-kick-off-historic-grounds-unesco-world-heritage-bid","story":"This year Footballrsquos Square Mile, the Worldrsquos Biggest Open-Air Football Museum, was launched following the discovery of the foundations of the worldrsquos first enclosed purposefully built international football ground - The st Hampden Park.Now those behind the move, The Hampden Collection, are taking things one step further and have today launched a bid for Unesco World Heritage Site status for Scotlandrsquos unique football history.Read more:First Hampden Park campaigners in bid for World Heritage Site statusAs reported in The Herald, the st Hampden was lsquolostrsquo for more than  years until extensive research revealed the only known map of its location in the National Records of Scotland in .The Hampden Collection was founded to promote this discovery and campaign for recognition of the three Hampden Parks, and all who played on them.Earlier this year Archaeology Scotland found the foundation stones of the original Hampden pavilion, beer bottles, clay pipes and teacups from the period, and wire fencing, which encompassed the original pitch.Hampden walking tours have proved popularGraeme Brown, of The Hampden Collection, said: ldquost Hampden is the lsquocentre spotrsquo of what we have termed lsquoFootballrsquos Square Milersquo, which is the worldrsquos most important football heritage site.This Square Mile encompasses the st, nd and rd Hampden, birthplaces of the Glasgow Football Club Titans: Queenrsquos Park, rd Lanark, Rangers and Celtic. Furthermore, this includes Cathcart Cemetery, which is the lsquoScotch Professorrsquo Burial Ground, and the final resting place of Hugh McColl, RS McColl, George Pattullo, Willie Maley and William Wilton, naming but a few. These were the grand architects of the lsquoScotch Gamersquo, which transcended international boundaries, and taught the World how to play football.Read more:Glasgow dancehall murders: Could more than one man have been Bible JohnFootballrsquos Square Mile is the home of the Scotch Professors, as they colloquially became known, who created the passing, running and inclusive game of football. Queenrsquos Park, widely considered to be the grand architects of modern football, built the worldrsquos first purposefully built, enclosed international football ground at st Hampden, created many of the rules and inventions used today, and created the template for how fans watch the game, including the fabled season ticket.Mr Brown added: ldquoOur mission is to take back Scotlandrsquos footballing heritage from those who have either rewritten it, or done little with it. Football is the lsquoPeoplesrsquo Beautul Gamersquo, crafted and created in Scotland for the world to enjoy and now watched by .bn people.\"The launch of the campaign coincides with the th anniversary of the worldrsquos first international football match, held at West of Scotland Cricket Ground in Partick, Glasgow, on St Andrewrsquos Day, . Queenrsquos Park Football Club fielded the entire Scottish team against England, gted the National Team their strip, organised the whole event and gave the world international football.Could first Hampden become part of Scottish football heritage siteAlthough playing at Queenrsquos Park Recreation Ground at the time, Queenrsquos Park chose West of Scotland Cricket Ground as their venue, with , people paying a shilling to enter the ground. Following the success of this event, Queenrsquos Park realised they had to build their own ground, and in , they opened st Hampden Park. In the following years, after this seismic event, football exploded across Scotland and began to take the world by storm, with the Scotch Professors leading the way.Leeann Dempster, Chief Executive of Queenrsquos Park Football Club, said: ldquoThe history of Queenrsquos Park is synonymous with Scottish Football, and we are delighted the heritage of the three Hampden Parks is being recognised, which forms a large part of the square mile footprint.This campaign will give the birthplace of modern football the biggest accolade of all, and I encourage everyone to learn the story of the Scotch Professors, and how they invented and exported the modern game.With  months to go before the th anniversary of the first international which will coincide with the first winter World Cup, Mr Brown believes they have they right credentials for Unesco status.He added: ldquoThere are ten selection criteria for UNESCO World Heritage Status, including lsquoto represent a masterpiece of human creative geniusrsquo and lsquoto bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilisation which is living or which has disappearedrsquo. We can argue Footballrsquos Square Mile has five of the  criteria set out by Unesco, and we only need one. There are twelve months to garner grass root support for this project and turn it into a viable reality.Jacqui Fernie, Co-Chair of the Friends of Cathcart Cemetery is supporting the Unesco campaign saying: ldquoGaining UNESCO World Heritage status would be immense for the area. This application recognises the lives and history of the people who played such a pivotal role in the development and growth of the game, and the unique place the Cathcart Cemetery has in celebrating their lives."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-deja-vu-alpha-omicron-uncertainty-ahead","story":"Within weeks it became clear that a highly transmissible new iant later dubbed Alpha, which had spread from Kent, would slow theto normality and cause thousands of extra Covid deaths in the process during a devastating winter wave.Confirmed Covid cases have been falling in Scotland since mid-November Twelve months later, many scientists believed the virus had evolved into its peakform with the subsequent rise of Delta, a strain which crushed and outcompeted all others wherever it took hold.Now, having amassed half a Greek alphabet of iants already, the world is faced with a new unknown: Omicron.: Omicron most challenging development in months, warns SturgeonLike the first iant of concern Alpha, it shares a marker - the S-gene dropout - which enables potential cases to be detected quickly in PCR testing before being confirmed through genomic sequencing.Surveillance indicates that these S-drop cases began rising from November , though not all were Omicron.

We are still hoping for the best and hoping that our developing understanding of this iant will reduce rather than increase our concern.“I very much hope that additional protections can be avoided and while we will act on a precautionary basis, we will always seek to act out at all times in a proportionate manner.”Research is still being undertaken on the Omicron iant — which was first discovered in southern Africa — but early indications are that it might be more transmissible than the dominant Deltra strain.However, she did say that there was no evidence that the symptoms of Omicron was dferent from Delta and the disease caused is any dferent.Scientists are also working to establish what impact this new iant will have on the effectiveness of vaccines.New recommendations are set to come from the joint committee on vaccination and immunisationis set to be announced this afternoon, and this will guide the Scottish Government on the shape of the booster programme.Ms Sturgeon said that evencurrent vaccines were less effective against the new iant, that was not the same as no effectiveness, and urged more people to come forward and become double vaccinated.She also urged travel restrictions to be tightened and called on a four nations approach in order to prevent the importation of the virus from abroad.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In those circumstances, we would ask friends, family and neighbours to keep an eye on people who may be experiencing problems as a result – and dial  to report any power issues. “We would ask that people ensure that anything that could be blown about is safely stowed away or tied down – strips of plastic or polythene, for instance, can cause power cutsthey get wrapped around power lines.”Weather and transport updates are available on the OIC Updates Facebook page and on the @OrkneyCouncil and @OrkneyPolice Twitter feeds.Readyscotland.org has a list of tips to stay safe including:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

However, the service and sacrice of all those who fought in the First World War continues to be remembered,” Sir Jeffrey said.“There is also a growing recognition that those who fought came from dferent backgrounds, but were in the trenches with a united goal. The war truly is part of our shared history and it is fitting that so many have travelled from Northern Ireland to mark the centenary of the tower.”Sir Jeffrey also paid tribute to the Somme Association for ensuring the Ulster Tower and Thiepval Wood are maintained to commemorate the past and keep those stories alive for future generations.

Reporter: Staff Reporter Nov   addthis, Local author Jane Buckley recently published the second of her four novels,Darkness,following the release of Stones Corner, Turmoilearlier this year. googletag.cmd.push The novels tell about the everyday realities of le in Derry and beyond from the early dark days of the Troubles in the s through to the Good Friday Peace Agreement in April . Jane said: When I look back at the launch of Stones Corner,Turmoilin February, I cant believe since then Ive completed a second novel,Darkness, and Im now working on the third,Light. Having begun to research the early s, Ill admit its been tough to find positive storylines. Ive also found it challenging, at times, to remain objective. For example, not only did I have to dig deep for good news stories, but events such as the HMS Maze hunger strikes along with the Troubles continuing to rage on was dficult. Thankfully, I came across some encouraging tales, and Ive developed them into progressive storylines. Jane said the global reception and fantastic reviews she has received for Turmoil and Darkness have been overwhelming. She added: “Readers from as far as New Zealand, the USA, Canada and even Denmark have remarked on how much theyve enjoyed the thrilling clf-hanging endings.  “Although one US reader was particularly upset when she got to the end of Turmoil without realising it was the first in a tetralogy. She was about to award me a four-star review until she got to the last chapter of Turmoil and instead sent me an email venting her frustration! I quickly contacted her and, thankfully, explained all, so much so, she gave me a five-star rating for Darkness. When Jane first completed Stones Corner, Turmoilduring lockdown, it began as a one-off project, a single novel but now its evolved into a series of four books or more formally known as a Tetralogy, a term for her which she admits she had to look up in a dictionary when one of her readers referred to it! Janes ambition was to educate the younger generation on le during the Troubles. However, she’s discovered that demo- graphically, most of her readers are women aged  upwards many of whom have remarked that through the descriptions of people and places in the books, theyve found themselves taken back in time and can closely identy with it. Marketing and promoting the novels has been a new experience for Jane. She explained: Marketing Stones Corner, Turmoil and Darkness, has been a whole new experience Ive learned so much in such a short time, some good, some bad!  “There are so many books published every year in the UK, circ.,, and an average authors sale per book is around . “Thankfully, my sales have exceeded that in just a matter of months, and with fingers and toes crossed, sales will increase over time as word of the books spread.  “Given Im an indie author, I must think out of the box when attracting readers – a continual challenge. Why would readers want to buy my book - a mere unknown  Yet they do, so I must be doing something right! Reviews are crucial to and it’s a fine line in nagging readers to leave them, but they’re critical for success. Local support for my work has proven invaluable readers are now recommending the books and knowing that they’re being read and discussed out there is satisfying beyond belief. Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol has added impetus to Janes desire to remind and encourage people to remember and learn everyday le during the Troubles.  I think its more important than ever that we dont allow the ugly head of sectarianism to rise again and threaten us with the horrors of another conflict and struggle. The Good Friday Agreement is still on thin ice and must be treated with care and common sense and clear thinking. You cant tell me theres anyone in this amazing country of ours would want to face conflict again  It would be a catastrophe for all of us. Jane has also received support from local authors, and in the process of introducing her work, investigated the opportunity of holding a Walled City Literature Festival in the city. She said: I was stunned at the amount and quality of Northern Irish based writers but couldnt see a local literature  for us to share and show off our work. As such, I spent a great deal of time putting a plan together for a three-day Derry-based festival over a weekend. Sadly, it didnt take happen because of a lack of funding.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Marie Lindsay, winner of Letime Achievement Award and Michael Allen, Head Teacher of the Year.Derry NewsDerry teachers top of the class after winning highly-prestigious awards overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia Derry NewsWATCH: TG and BBC ALBA celebrate Saint Colmcille who was born  years ago on December  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The same goes for age and stage, for example, just because a jigsaw says  pieces and age from three years it does not mean your three year will be able to do it especiallythey’ve never done a jigsaw before. Remember, too, it’s all well and good saying he’ll be able to do it in the summer, that’s six months away,he can’t nearly do it now, and won’t be able to with a bit of help don’t buy it or there’ll be tears, snotters and grumps from you both. Personal  Social -doll and teddy to cuddle, feed, dance and play with or even just look cute sitting on the bed! Role Play Toys -such as tea set, pram, brush, hoover, kitchen to make dinner - or dinner for dolly! Imaginative Play -cars   fire engine   digger, train with track or a garage for cars -it’s got a ramp even better. Or Peppa Pig swing and slide, farm, Noah’s ark, bus with people to go on! Happy Land offer a great range in early imaginative play toys. Or traditional dolls house, rockets, play mobile sets etc. Animals -farm animals - maybe use pretend grass for the field. Animal figures to name, to later match baby to mum or add to imaginative play. Themed animals for older children - boys and bugs, girls and sea animals. Bricks And Block -mega blocks or wooden bricks to build and knock down and later to sort colours and shapes, or make into buildings and tunnels. Of course, there’s lego, meccano and magnetic building toys too. Puzzles -peg puzzles,  Cause And Effect Toys -for younger children, to press buttons, push levers left and right, turn handles for noise   lights   new sights, wooden hammer bench or a press and spin toy. Or maybe noisy toys, xylophone, drum and of course an old favourite the laser zapper that makes that awful noise.  Push and Pull toys -dog on a rope, rainbow wheel, duck with a handle - defo for those just walking. Outside -sit-on scooter, sit in car, balance bike, bubble fish, pull and play wagon or slide. Balls, to kick, throw, learn to catch or throw through a basket ball hoop. For older children hula hoop, roller skates or Space Hoppers!!! Special Place -tent with cushions, maybe a garden house or even just fairy lights and voile to go around her bed  Craft -chunky crayons and paintbrushes, finger paint, maybe try water colour paints for your budding artist, or an easel. Playdough sets, jewellery making, aeroplane building, wooden car making - what does your child like  Bath Time -ducks or boats to float, dolly to bath, smelly bath bubbles, or even a packet of jelly bath!  And to finish, the rhyme I say every year, buy me … and remember … Something I want, something I need, something to wear, something to read. Something so I can play a game with you, something that helps me learn too. Something to help my imagination grow, something creative to make or sew Something for inside, something for out and maybe a surprise I can tell my friends about! Everything doesn’t have to have batteries or be plugged in, Technology is great in small amounts, but it’s time to play with you that counts. So this Christmas time buy what I like and need, don’t go mad and buy up the shop, Think of the things we can do together,because its time to talk, sing, read and play, Which builds my future every day!

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

Its no dferent from what Irelands Great Hunger refugees faced.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Nov Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, People Before Profit councillor, Shaun Harkin, has demanded that Prime-Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary, Priti Patel, be put up at the International Criminal Court in The Hague for their policies on immigration. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Harkin was speaking at the United Against Racism rally last Sunday next to the backdrop of Derrys Emigration Statues at Queens Quay that symbolise the citys own refugees who had to flee the starvation and persecution of An Gorta Moacuter in the s. Drawing parallels with those that sought refuge around the world from Ireland back then, Cllr Harkin said the  refugees who died trying to cross the English Channel last week need not have done so. Citing the British Governments immigration policies, Cllr Harkin said Mr Johnson and Ms Patel should be held accountable at the highest level for creating a culture in Britain that demonised migrants and asylum seekers. He said: “Its fitting we are gathered by the Great Hunger statues. One million people died across Ireland through starvation and disease. “They didnt need to die but did because the British government decided profits for a tiny handful of very wealthy people was more important than saving hundreds of thousands of lives. “More than one million people fled Ireland in a short number of years. They traveled by whatever means they could in complete desperation and were not welcomed with open arms wherever they arrived. “They were described as famine Irish who were swarming across seas bringing backwardness, disease and poverty. Today, we see millions of people fleeing starvation, war, crushing poverty and climate change. Its no dferent from what Irelands Great Hunger refugees faced. “People from Iraq and Afghanistan are almost always included among those fleeing and among those drowning. “Both countries were brought to ruin by US and British government disastrous wars and occupations that succeeded in killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people and stuffing billions in blood profits into the bank account of arms manufacturers. “In  the toddler Alan Kurdi washed up on Greek beach. The world responded with grief, with outrage and demanded action. Nothing has changed. “Boris Johnson and Priti Patel should be going to the International Criminal Court for their racist immigration policies, for their efforts to demonise migrants and asylum seekers, for their role in the death of innocent people at sea, in trucks, in freezing camps.” Cllr Harkins ire was also directed at the European Union who he accused as being equally culpable as Mr Johnson and Ms Patel. He added: “Were told over and over how progressive EU bureaucrats are. Its a myth. “Twenty seven people died in the English channel last week but nearly  people have died in the Mediterranean Sea this year already. “Nearly , have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea since . This is the direct result of racist EU immigration policies. “EU bosses are spending tens of billions to strengthen Fortress Europe with surveillance, patrols and  kilometres of border walls. “Nothing has changed because the British government and EU bureaucrats prioritise upholding racist borders and the wealth of a handful of billionaires over taking real humanitarian action. “The British government and EU elites will never put humanity before billionaires, powerful corporations and war profiteers. “James Connolly, a migrant himself, opposed a border in Ireland but also opposed borders across Europe. He continues to speak for a vision directly opposed to that of elites and billionaires: “The day will come, and perhaps like a bolt from the blue, when the frontiers will not be sufficient to prevent the handclasp of friendship between the peoples. “But that day will come only when the kings and kaisers, queens and czars, financiers and capitalists who now oppress humanity will be hurled from their place and power. “And the emancipated workers of the earth, no longer the blind instruments of rich men’s greed will found a new society, a new civilisation, whose corner stone will be labour, whose inspiring principle will be justice, whose limits humanity alone can bound. “If we want to end English Channel and Mediterranean Sea drowning tragedies this is what we need to aspire to do.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City!

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Marie Lindsay, winner of Letime Achievement Award and Michael Allen, Head Teacher of the Year.Derry NewsDerry teachers top of the class after winning highly-prestigious awards overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia Derry NewsWATCH: TG and BBC ALBA celebrate Saint Colmcille who was born  years ago on December  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Marie Lindsay, winner of Letime Achievement Award and Michael Allen, Head Teacher of the Year.Derry NewsDerry teachers top of the class after winning highly-prestigious awards overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia Derry NewsWATCH: TG and BBC ALBA celebrate Saint Colmcille who was born  years ago on December  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

However, with confidence ing as vaccination rates rise, and economies gradually open back up, people are on the hunt again. He commented, “Recruitment is becoming an employee’s market, and the volume of roles available gives workers more options, allowing them to select the business with the best offering. Furthermore, after  months of working from their own homes, many people don’t want to go back to the office full-time.” Some % of respondents to a survey of around , Irish employees by the University of Limerick’s Kemmy Business School said they agreed or strongly agreed that ‘my future career lies outside of this organisation’. This was regardless of whether they worked in multinationals, indigenous Irish companies, SMEs or the public sector. The survey found that % of managers, % of site leaders, % of regional leaders and % of global leaders based in Ireland also feel their future lies outside of their current organisation. Mr Kindlon said businesses that fail to prioritise employee wellbeing, professional development and company culture could see employees leave in their droves in search of an employer that better meets their needs – and struggle to recruit new talent to the business. “It’s crucial that businesses focus on becoming an employer of choice in order to sustain operations and accelerate growth as economies recover from the disruption of the pandemic.” While competitive pay and generous perks are key to employee satisfaction and retention, he said flexibility and the ability to make a meaningful contribution to the job is just as important. “Multiple studies have shown that, more than ever, traditional office-based workers want a better work-le balance. That means flexible, remote or hybrid working to allow them to manage their professional and personal responsibilities in a way that benefits both their wellbeing and productivity.” “It means offering tangible, valuable employee benefits that put employee wellbeing at the forefront – so less of the ping pong tables, more of the competitive pension contributions and annual leave allowances. And it means nurturing a more positive company culture, in which the right to disconnect is respected – and so are employees.” He said the true impact of the great resignation remains to be seen, but employers who take the possibility of mass resignations and stled recruitment lightly will surely bear the brunt of this once-in-a-generation phenomenon as we move into . “Losing employees can be very costly. If multiple employees leave within a short time frame, depending on your company size you could be hit with huge costs as well as stled growth while you backfill positions.” There are a number of ways that companies can retain and engage current employees. These include offering a competitive mix of employee benefits with tangible value – such as enhanced pension payments, health insurance, above-statutory annual leave allowances, and flexible working to support employees’ work-le balance and wellbeing. Offering routes for career progression, either through promotion opportunities or by enabling employees to move to a dferent area of the business where desired and appropriate are also options. Mr Kindlon said the great resignation is both a threat and an opportunity for businesses in a wide range of industries. “While some businesses could see employees leave due to a number of contributing factors, employers with a competitive offering could see an increase in the talent available to bring into their teams.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Marie Lindsay, winner of Letime Achievement Award and Michael Allen, Head Teacher of the Year.Derry NewsDerry teachers top of the class after winning highly-prestigious awards overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia Derry NewsWATCH: TG and BBC ALBA celebrate Saint Colmcille who was born  years ago on December  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City!

Cole joined Derry City in , and went on to make  appearances for the club. He played in last week’s - win over Dundalk, but was restricted to just  appearances overall this season. “Darren has been a fantastic servant to the club over the past five years,” Ruaidhri Higgins said. “He was very unlucky to pick up that injury in  which kept him out of the side. To his credit however he has worked his way back to full fitness and finished the season very strongly for us.” Walsh joined the club at the start of the season, but injury problems plagued him throughout his time at the club, as he made just  appearances. He did score a vital last gasp equaliser against Bohemians at the Brandywell in June but made just two more appearances after that. “Marc was very unlucky at times too, but Derry fans did get a chance to see how good he was just before the end of the season,” Higgins explained. “I want to thank both players for all their hard work since I came into the club and wish them the very best for the future.” The manager also confirmed that coach Cretaro has left for personal reasons. “I can confirm as well that first team coach Raff Cretaro is also leaving,” Higgins added. “Raff came in with me in April and has been a real influence around the club. He has a great way about him and is hugely popular with both the players and the staff.” “He does however have family commitments and I understand that. I know he has really enjoyed his time at Derry City and we would also like to wish Raff every success going forward.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Marie Lindsay, winner of Letime Achievement Award and Michael Allen, Head Teacher of the Year.Derry NewsDerry teachers top of the class after winning highly-prestigious awards overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia Derry NewsWATCH: TG and BBC ALBA celebrate Saint Colmcille who was born  years ago on December  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

There was quite the dference between the team which started the campaign, and that which ended the season in fourth place – both in terms of personnel and belief and suddenly Derry City fans are looking towards  with great excitement. There were moments of great excitement, and others of great disappointment, but finally there seems to be a real direction about the club and the  campaign could well be looked on as the year that things finally started to change for the better at the Brandywell. Derry News Sports Editor Gary Ferry looks back on a memorable season and hands out the awards for those Derry City players who have really caught the eye in .   PLAYER OF THE SEASON RONAN BOYCE There have been some stand-out performers this season. Joe Thomson has come into his own, Ciaron Harkin has been back to his best, and Jamie McGonigle has been a revelation. But Ronan Boyce has been the stand-out by far. The -year-old broke through to the first team and became a regular this season, first appearing as a substitute against St. Patrick’s Athletic in March, and going on to make  starts and  substitute appearances. Boyce made his Derry City debut as a very late substitute against Shelbourne last October but came into his own this season and scored his first senior goal in the - draw with Drogheda United at the Brandywell in April. That was a real sign of things to come and the defender went on to score six more times, with goals against Waterford, St. Patrick’s Athletic, Sligo Rovers , Shamrock Rovers and Bohemians. The youngster’s goals were very often crucial to the team, with his seven goals earning the Candystripes seven points in all.  GOAL OF THE SEASON JAMIE McGONIGLE VS. BOHEMIANS If any game stood out for Derry City this season, then it was surely the - draw against Bohemians at Dalymount Park in September. Trailing - at half time, Derry City responded with a sensational display of attacking football in the second half. The equaliser which brought them back into the game was out of this world, as Jamie McGonigle collected a pass from Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, approached the Bohs penalty area from the left wing before curling the ball exquisitely around the defender past James Talbot into the top corner. It was enough to make Ruaidhri Higgins and everyone on the bench race onto the pitch in celebration and was a goal which deserved to win any game. Two Four goals followed that strike as a Georgie Kelly worldie deep in added time denied Derry the win, and ensured the first - league draw in  years but that goal from McGonigle has not been forgotten.  MOST IMPROVED PLAYER JOE THOMSON Since Ruaidhri Higgins has come in as manager, Joe Thomson has really stood up to prove invaluable in the Derry City midfield. His battling qualities, as well as his passing and ability to transition from defence to attack has really made him stand out this year, making  starts and  substitute appearances in all competitions. But it is his ability to shoot which has taken him to another level. He doubled his goal tally this year, scoring four times, against St. Patrick’s Athletic, Waterford, Sligo Rovers and Finn Harps, and some of them were absolute belters. He also chipped in with five assists and unsurprisingly signed a new deal recently to keep him at the club next season.  BEST NEW SIGNING JAMIE McGONIGLE Since joining Derry City in June, Jamie McGonigle has proved just why Ruaidhri Higgins is such a huge fan. After a stop-start beginning to his le as a Candystripe, McGonigle has been superb. Be it his incredible goal against Bohemians, or his late penalty against Finn Harps, McGonigle has proved that he is the big man for big moments. He has already scored two winners against Dundalk, and scored four goals in his last three games to finish as Derry’s top scorer with  goals, even though he joined in mid-season. In  appearances, he has provided  goals and  assists, and with a good pre-season in the coming months, he could be unstoppable next year.  BEST MOMENT OF THE SEASON BEATING DUNDALK AT LAST It might not have been the greatest game, but the victory over Dundalk on August  was long, long, long overdue. Derry City had suffered against the Lilywhites for close to a decade, and any type of win was needed just to get that monkey off our backs. It came as a result of a Jamie McGonigle penalty, and also gave Derry a win over one of the so-called big teams in quite a while. It was the first Brandywell victory over Dundalk since October, , when a Derry City team which included Ruaidhri Higgins won -. That win gave City some real belief and they followed that up with their first win at Oriel Park since  by winning - on the final day of the season to secure fourth place.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Marie Lindsay, winner of Letime Achievement Award and Michael Allen, Head Teacher of the Year.Derry NewsDerry teachers top of the class after winning highly-prestigious awards overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia Derry NewsWATCH: TG and BBC ALBA celebrate Saint Colmcille who was born  years ago on December  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

There was quite the dference between the team which started the campaign, and that which ended the season in fourth place – both in terms of personnel and belief and suddenly Derry City fans are looking towards  with great excitement. There were moments of great excitement, and others of great disappointment, but finally there seems to be a real direction about the club and the  campaign could well be looked on as the year that things finally started to change for the better at the Brandywell. Derry News Sports Editor Gary Ferry looks back on a memorable season and hands out the awards for those Derry City players who have really caught the eye in .   PLAYER OF THE SEASON RONAN BOYCE There have been some stand-out performers this season. Joe Thomson has come into his own, Ciaron Harkin has been back to his best, and Jamie McGonigle has been a revelation. But Ronan Boyce has been the stand-out by far. The -year-old broke through to the first team and became a regular this season, first appearing as a substitute against St. Patrick’s Athletic in March, and going on to make  starts and  substitute appearances. Boyce made his Derry City debut as a very late substitute against Shelbourne last October but came into his own this season and scored his first senior goal in the - draw with Drogheda United at the Brandywell in April. That was a real sign of things to come and the defender went on to score six more times, with goals against Waterford, St. Patrick’s Athletic, Sligo Rovers , Shamrock Rovers and Bohemians. The youngster’s goals were very often crucial to the team, with his seven goals earning the Candystripes seven points in all.  GOAL OF THE SEASON JAMIE McGONIGLE VS. BOHEMIANS If any game stood out for Derry City this season, then it was surely the - draw against Bohemians at Dalymount Park in September. Trailing - at half time, Derry City responded with a sensational display of attacking football in the second half. The equaliser which brought them back into the game was out of this world, as Jamie McGonigle collected a pass from Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, approached the Bohs penalty area from the left wing before curling the ball exquisitely around the defender past James Talbot into the top corner. It was enough to make Ruaidhri Higgins and everyone on the bench race onto the pitch in celebration and was a goal which deserved to win any game. Two Four goals followed that strike as a Georgie Kelly worldie deep in added time denied Derry the win, and ensured the first - league draw in  years but that goal from McGonigle has not been forgotten.  MOST IMPROVED PLAYER JOE THOMSON Since Ruaidhri Higgins has come in as manager, Joe Thomson has really stood up to prove invaluable in the Derry City midfield. His battling qualities, as well as his passing and ability to transition from defence to attack has really made him stand out this year, making  starts and  substitute appearances in all competitions. But it is his ability to shoot which has taken him to another level. He doubled his goal tally this year, scoring four times, against St. Patrick’s Athletic, Waterford, Sligo Rovers and Finn Harps, and some of them were absolute belters. He also chipped in with five assists and unsurprisingly signed a new deal recently to keep him at the club next season.  BEST NEW SIGNING JAMIE McGONIGLE Since joining Derry City in June, Jamie McGonigle has proved just why Ruaidhri Higgins is such a huge fan. After a stop-start beginning to his le as a Candystripe, McGonigle has been superb. Be it his incredible goal against Bohemians, or his late penalty against Finn Harps, McGonigle has proved that he is the big man for big moments. He has already scored two winners against Dundalk, and scored four goals in his last three games to finish as Derry’s top scorer with  goals, even though he joined in mid-season. In  appearances, he has provided  goals and  assists, and with a good pre-season in the coming months, he could be unstoppable next year.

Heres a round-up of the greatest guest appearances in Toy Show history  Girls Aloud  Toby appeared on the Late Late Toy Show in  and was surprised by mega girl-band Girls Aloud when he was performing their song on a Karaoke machine. Little Toby was stunned to see the pop group in person.   Ed Sheeran -  The greatest duet in ! Aimee Keogh was speaking about her love for music when showing Ryan Tubridy a Karaoke Machine, and included Ed Sheeran in her list of favourite artists. Ryan Tubridy and Aimee began to duet Lego House by Ed Sheeran, when she was surprised by the man himself. Starstruck and surprised by his appearance, she began to sing with Ed Sheeran on the Karoke Machine. Mr. Sheeran surprised her with tickets to his concert in London that year.  Danny from the Script  A group of three children sang Superheroes by the Script on the Late Late Toy Show in  as they were big fans of The Script.

Michael was very professional and continued singing despite the shock and surprise sketched on his face. It was a truly heartwarming moment that uplted the viewers as we battled our second lockdown last year.  Davy Fitz: One of the most iconic moments in Toy Show history, Michael won the hearts of the nation when he appeared on the Toy Show. He revealed his favourite GAA manager was Davy Fitz and joked that he did not think they would get along as he was from six-mile bridge. Dvy Fitz walked out and surprised Michael, who was bewildered by his appearance. He asked Mr. Fitz to sign his book as he had brought it along with him . Davy invited Michael to speak to the Wexford team before their league matches.  While many celebrities drop by to say hello to Ryan and the children, family members also make an appearance. These are sure to warm your heart, and no doubt tonight will add to the list. Nanny Pat  Tom stole the show in  when he was surprised by his Nanny Pat on set of the Toy Show. He previously said he liked to knit with his Nanny Pat and she gave the best hugs. The two embraced with a warm hug and smiles all around. A very heartwarming moment in .

Adam and Kayla unwrapped a giant present where their Dad was hiding, both children had tears of joy when he emerged. Graham ed from Mali where he has been completing his th tour of duty peacekeeping overseas.  John Doyle the Porter  Ireland was introduced to the lovely Adam King last year, and the nation was besotted with him. During his segment on the Toy Show, Adams favourite hospital porter surprised him on set and Adam gave him a virtual hug. John said Adam brings the best out of everyone he meets and he had the brightest smile.  Alex from Austraila  Lee and his family were surprised by their big sister Alex who came home from Australia for Christmas. Alex was not supposed to come home for Christmas, but Ryan and co. brought her home for Christmas to surprise the entire family. It was an emotional reunion as Lee had not seen his sister in three years and embraced her in a big hug.  Many more memorable appearances have occurred throughout the history of the Late Late Toy Show, and tonight will be no dferent. The list continues to grow with every show, and itreally is the most wonderful time of the year.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Marie Lindsay, winner of Letime Achievement Award and Michael Allen, Head Teacher of the Year.Derry NewsDerry teachers top of the class after winning highly-prestigious awards overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia Derry NewsWATCH: TG and BBC ALBA celebrate Saint Colmcille who was born  years ago on December  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Written by Johnny Gogan and Brian Leyden and directed by Gogan, the film was produced by Dromahair-based Bandit Films. The film was scored by Sligo’s Glenn Garrett, edited by Dromahair-based Patrick O’Rourke and shot by Strandhill videographer Peter Martin. Black Ice tells the story of Alicewho is drawn into the clandestine boy - and girl - racing scene where Jimmyis considered top dog among the petrol heads in a fictional Donegal border community. Their relationship and their attempts to get into the legitimate rallying scene are undermined by forces at work in this shadowy border world threatening their ambition, the town where they live and, ultimately, Alice’s family. Black Ice received a wide release in Ireland in  and was one of the best Irish performers at the box office and on DVD that year. The film received repeat broadcasts on RTEacute. The film’s release on Netflix follows the recent release of Johnny Gogan’s feature documentary Hubert Butler Witness to the Future on the streaming service. The film will now be available - in multiple languages - across Netflix’ European network Johnny Gogan s to Donegal for the commencement of his new novel Station to Station. The pacy thriller about a rogue Irish diplomat commences and revisits at ious points in the narrative, Donegal’s Lough Derg pilgrimage island. Station to Station which featured at the recent Allingham Festival is centred around the uncovering of the corruption around a rather unique Irish-Spanish property deal on the south coast of Spain. Published by Lepus Print, the book is available through independent book shops in Donegal and nationally. Johnny Gogan’s other feature drama work includes The Bargain Shop , The Last Bus Home , Mapmakerand the drama-documentary Prisoners of the Moon . The release of his feature documentary Groundswell earlier this year was welcomed by ’s Chief Film Critic Peter Bradshaw as “a lesson to communities there and everywhere  to stay vigilant”.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Marie Lindsay, winner of Letime Achievement Award and Michael Allen, Head Teacher of the Year.Derry NewsDerry teachers top of the class after winning highly-prestigious awards overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pic by Mark DohertySportSlaughtneil and Loughgiel play out breathless draw in Ulster final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia Derry NewsWATCH: TG and BBC ALBA celebrate Saint Colmcille who was born  years ago on December  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

An Innocent Man: Saturday, Talking Pictures TV @ pm Jimmies living a grand le in Calornia. Mike and Danny are two crooked cops not averse to robbing and framing suspects. One day they all collide and lives are shattered. A gritty and vicious thriller from  that didnt strike a chord with TV audiences used to Sellecks friendly Magnum persona but its a film thats really worth reevaluation. Selleck, David Rasche, Laila Robins, Bjada Djola and F. Murray Abraham add to a heady mix. Zombieland: Saturday, Syfy @ pm Americas been overthrown by the undead and a young man from Columbus, Ohio just wants to get home. On his danger fraught journey he meets another survivor from Tallahassee, Florida and both decide to stick together. This is a joy, from its Metallica scored opening scene to its fairground set climax its pure and utter fun. Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face.

An Innocent Man: Saturday, Talking Pictures TV @ pm Jimmies living a grand le in Calornia. Mike and Danny are two crooked cops not averse to robbing and framing suspects. One day they all collide and lives are shattered. A gritty and vicious thriller from  that didnt strike a chord with TV audiences used to Sellecks friendly Magnum persona but its a film thats really worth reevaluation. Selleck, David Rasche, Laila Robins, Bjada Djola and F. Murray Abraham add to a heady mix. Zombieland: Saturday, Syfy @ pm Americas been overthrown by the undead and a young man from Columbus, Ohio just wants to get home. On his danger fraught journey he meets another survivor from Tallahassee, Florida and both decide to stick together. This is a joy, from its Metallica scored opening scene to its fairground set climax its pure and utter fun. Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face. Controversial on release and highly influential in the years since this  drama is an excellent look at the light and dark of the swinging s. Michael Caine, Shelley Winters and Julia Foster all nail their parts. Transsiberian: Monday, Great! Movies Action @ .pm A couple are travelling home from China and take the train to Moscow. Along the way they meet another couple. Things get......well youll just have to see for yourself. A finely crafted and atmospheric watch from the Hitchcockian school of thrillers. Its rather violent and one scene may have you reaching for the remote but stick with it, its worth your time. Woody Harrelson, Emily Mortimer, Kate Mara and Ben Kingsley do good work The Man From Colorado: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Owen Devereauxs been appointed the federal judge of a region in Colorado but hes not exactly suited to the job. He has psychopathic tendencies that have, in the past during the civil war, been covered up by his friend Del, a man not willing to do it anymore. From  comes an uncommonly deep and thoughtful western that isnt afraid to shy away from big themes. For once Glenn Ford plays a villainous part and he does it well. William Holden and James Millican excel in supporting roles. The Man Who Knew Too Much: Wednesday, Film @ .pm An American family take an impulsive trip to Morocco and finds themselves in the midst of an assassination attempt and their lives are immediately in danger. It sounds heavy but this is one of Alfred Hitchcocks lighter and more enjoyable films. James Stewart and Doris Day lead the film and are delightful as their roles as always. A highly enjoyable and suspenseful film worth recording for a rainy afternoon. Deep Blue Sea: Wednesday, TCM @ pm In an attempt to find a cure for Alzheimers disease a scientist grows mega sharks so she can experiment on their brains. These sharks are kept in a secret facility but guess what  They are really brainy and really hungry. Renny Harlins sci actioner from  is gloriously stupid but its loads and loads of fun too. Blood spills and jokes fly as a wicked cast that includes Thomas Jane, Aida Turturro, Saffron Burrows and Samuel L. Jackson struggle to stay in one piece. The Conversation: Thursday, BBC @ pm Harrys a surveillance expert and hes got a new job. But the work is getting to him and his paranoia is at an all time high due to past events. Francis Ford Coppolas  thriller is a stunner. A post Watergate classic seeped in the pervading atmosphere of a broken country. Gene Hackmans spectacular as a man coming apart at the seams and the late John Cazale as his partner is as always magnicent. A nerve shredding watch. The Blood On Satans Claw: Friday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm A rural village in th century England is thrown into upheaval when an evil looking skull is unearthed by a plough and sinister things start happening in the aftermath. A prime example of folk horror, a subgenre from the early s that would still give you the chills nearly  years later. Its hefty stuff, that in places will offend but its genuinely effective. Patrick Wymark, Linda Hayden and Barry Andrews all do strong work. Damsel: Friday, TG @ .pm A man travels across the American Frontier of the th century on a little horse called Butterscotch. Hes looking for the love of his le so he can propose and the only thing between him and happiness is danger. A lot of danger. A slowburn pace might annoy some but this left-field take on the western genre is an entertaining and twisting watch propelled by nice turns from Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. Lapsis: Friday, Film @ .pm Rays taken a strange new job to help support his ailing brother. Hes marching into the woods, dragging miles of cable behind him to connect up cubes used for futuristic trading.

However, the scoreboard remained the same as heroic UCC defence and a lack of accuracy at crucial times undid all the hard work.A forward pass undid one multi-phase attack and a penalty given away in an attacking position from an otherwise excellent line-out maul foiled another.Then a superb scrummaging effort won the home side a penalty on the UCC five-metre line. Ballynahinch looked to turn the screw and opted for another scrum, only to give away a penalty and come away from another stint in the UCC  with nothing.As the opportunities came and went UCC continued to defend well and kick superbly and when Squires got them out of trouble with a brilliantly executed - kick to give them a foothold in Ballynahinch territory they were visibly lted and reasserted themselves in attack.They were able to close out the game, despite missing a penalty in front of the posts and having another kick and chase try disallowed for a knock-on, leaving Ballynahinch reflecting on how they failed to turn all their possession and territory statistics into points.The league table, which is the only statistic that counts at the end of the season, shows Ballynahinch at the bottom, having been defeated by their nearest rivals in their last two outings.There is no respite as Munster giants Cork Constitution roll into Ballymacarn Park this weekend on the back of three consecutive wins, having shrugged off their uncharacteristically slow start to the season.Ballynahinch : John Dickson, Zack McCall, Kyle McCall, James Simpson, John Donnan, Thomas Donnan, Oli Loughead, Bradley Luney, Chris Gibson, Jack Milligan, Aaron Cairns, Rory Butler, Tagen Strydom, Shane Ball, Yasser Omar, Josh Hanlon, Nacho Cladera Crespo, Diego Vidal Souza, Callum Irvine, Conor McCauley, Greg Hutley..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Business boost for high street  ","story":"BUSINESSES across the district are being given a unique opportunity to help shape the future of high streets across the Newry, Mourne and Down area.Members of a Stormont task force spearheading a new initiative will be in Downpatrick next week for a workshop designed to provide local people with their say on how to rejuvenate town centres in a post-Covid world.Junior ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney mdash who are leading the task force mdash will be at Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn on Thursday,December , and are encouraging business owners and residents to come along and have their say during what is being billed as an evidence gathering exercise.A number of local councillors have echoed their appeal for people to take part in the two-hour event which starts at pm.Designed to help make town, city and village centres places where people can do business, socialise, shop, be creative and use public services, the task force is determined to make a dference, with its membership including a raft of government departments and key organisations including Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster.The junior ministers say while there are many common and shared challenges, they recognise that every high street is dferent and has its own character, personality and needs that will each require bespoke local solutions.They want to hear views and evidence from far and wide, across both urban and rural areas and are urging e everyone with an interest in the future of their local high street to respond to the call for evidence and share their views.The task forcersquos visit to Downpatrick comes after it was revealed that there are currently  empty shop units in the town centre.In addition, the finishing touches are being put to a pound, revitalisation scheme in Church Street, while work is continuing to redevelop the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty, adjacent buildings as part of a major retail and commercial development opportunity which, it is hoped, can attract a number of leading retailers.Ahead of the Downpatrick consultation event, the business community and wider civic society is being asked to put forward ideas on what success in high streets could look like, with the focus on family friendly destinations where people want to shop, socialise, live and work.The task force said the series of workshops provide important opportunities for everyone to have their say and make their views known, with the junior ministers particularly keen to hear from a wide spectrum of people.Mr Kearney added: ldquoOur high streets are for everyone.

This was due mostly to a long, very arduous hill along the back straight but there were also some very tricky tight turns which were treacherous.There was a long downhill which some used as recovery but others saw this as a chance to gain places and they threw caution to the wind, flinging themselves down the descent in an alarming fashion.The spectators had plenty to watch and saw the runners several times per lap.Mackenzie Murray found it hard to get himself into the groove in the U-  race and despite coming second overall, he felt that his performance was under par.Looking back at how well he ran in Ballyclare recently, it is hard to argue with this self assessment.

It calls you to be salt and light about what you believe in, she said.ldquoIt does annoy me when people say you have to take religion out of politics and leave it at the doorhelliplike it only happens at the weekend. It is part of who you are.ldquoYour Christianity and your faith is something that is with you all the time. You canrsquot just leave it at home on Sunday night and go out without it on Monday.Mrs Foster said she does not hold grudges against those who had hurt her, including former colleague Edwin Poots, who ousted her from the DUP leadership in May before being forced out of office himself just weeks later.Reflecting on the decision by Sinn Fein to collapse the executive with the resignation of then Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness in , she said: ldquoWe got into a spiral and we couldnrsquot stop it and it got to a point then where the assembly collapsed and of course I regret that it was down for three years.She said she liked the late DUP leader Ian Paisley very much. ldquoHe used to joke with me and say, lsquoHow are the Anglicans doing Arlenersquo Asked by Mr Kellyshe thought Dr Paisley had mellowed over the years, she said: ldquoI never knew Dr Paisley personally until   and I think he probably was in a dferent space than he had been in the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties.She declined to speculate on what might have changed him. ldquoI donrsquot know. I canrsquot answer that. I only know he was very supportive of me as a female and an Anglican and as an outsider. He asked me to be in the administration in  which I have always been very thankful for.Mrs Foster said her Christian faith helped her to seek common ground with people she did not agree with, adding that her reason forgoing into government with Sinn Fein was to make sure that her children and others did not endure what she went through as a child.This included the attempted murder in  on her father, John, an RUC reservist, living on the Fermanagh border, and a bomb attack on her school bus driver in which her friend was left severely injured.Recalling the gun attack on her father, when she was around eight years old, she said he came crawling back from the barn, after gunshots were fired, with blood dripping from his forehead.ldquoIt was a very strange time, she said. ldquoMy mother was sitting at the kitchen table and I donrsquot know what she was doing but I will never forget her face. She just froze.Ms Foster said it was not politically correct to say it, but she felt she benefited from being educated at an all-girl school, where she grew in confidence.The former political leader said she was enjoying her new role in journalism as a presenter on GB news - but said more must be done to tackle the hurtful abuse on social media particularly against women.Mrs Foster was welcomed by Dr Tim Campbell, director of the St Patrick Centre, who said her personal story was incredibly interesting.He remarked: ldquoArlene Foster was extremely gracious and gave very generously of her time and people in the audience responded to her warmth..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  November 28%2C 2001  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Angry traders in Downpatrick have this week called for tougher action to be taken against teenagers terrorising local businesses.They are demanding that the townrsquos police commanders are provided with additional resources to take the problem and that the courts hand out much stfer sentences.Their call comes amid mounting concern about the behaviour of an umber of juveniles who are verbally abusing and intimidating female staff in shops throughout the town and stealing from businesses.Traders say they are becoming increasingly frustrated that no punitive action is taken against the teenagers when they appear before the courts and that the sentences handed out to them are too light.The current position is so serious that number of shop owners are locking their doors during opening hours and admitting customers only after a visual check.One local trader, who did not want to be named, said the teenagers responsible for the trouble were being allowed to intimidate the business community and suggested an exclusion order should be placed on them, banning them from the town.ldquoThese people have no fear and no shame and walk about the town asthey owned the place.

Once people leave the bars they then head over to the takeaways where they hang out until around .am.ldquoEveryone is usually very drunk and I believe this is leading to a lot of the sectarian trouble in the town. It is completely unfair to any residents living close by who are trying to sleep and are kept awake by drunk people hanging around the streets, he said.SEAFORDE mdash A mother of five feels she has no choice to to move house following plans to erect a telecommunications mast at Seaforde.Siobhan Devlin recently moved into her home at Dunnanew Road and was horried to discover that a number of mobile telephone companies are planning to extend an existing mast close to her house to accommodate  new antennae.She is so concerned about the effects the mast could boast to her childrenrsquos health she is seriously considering selling her newly build dream house.Accusing mobile phone companies of being completely undemocratic by putting masts up against the wishes of the local community, she said she cannot understand why a decision was taken to extend a mast so close to a large number of houses.The Seaforde community is overwhelmingly behind Siobhan and a group of parents, concerned for the health of their children, have written a letter to planners demanding the development is stopped.She said: ldquoEveryone is completely shocked that such a major proposal has ben put to planners so close to our homes. A large area of residential land will be affectedthis plan goes ahead and nobody is happy about it.ldquoWe feel that we are being used as guinea pigs as nobody can tell us they are  per cent sure that these masts do not pose any health risks.ldquoDo planners honestly believe that residents, especially those with young children, will accept this proposal  If the plan goes ahead I really think I will have to move as I do not want my children living so close to that mast.KILLOUGH mdash Plans for the regeneration of Killough were put before Down councillors at a meeting on Monday night.Representatives from the Palatine Trust met with members of the councilrsquos recreation and technical services committee to give an update on how the regeneration work in the village is developing and discussed future plans for the area.The council has funded pound, towards the refurbishment of the harbour area since the trust was first set up in .

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: ldquoI took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.ldquoIt is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.ldquoThis decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.ldquoThis decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.ldquoThese housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.ldquoSince my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast ndash that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.ldquoKeeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.ldquoAdhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.ldquoMy officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Photo: Brian Lawless PA WireThe few travellers waiting for flights to Britain including a smattering of Irish fans of English football teams seemed to be unaware of his presence. He kept himself inconspicuous and moved about the near deserted glass and steel surroundings ashe didn’t want to be seen.Yet this man had once mixed with world leaders including presidents and prime ministers. He had played an important part in putting together an international peace treaty-settlement, which appeared to have ended a seemingly endless conflict. On his own turf he had made history by winning three general elections in a row. He was of course Bertie Ahern.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Henry McDonald is a formerand Observer Ireland correspondent and author of books including a biography of David Trimble and INLA: Deadly DivisionsHis dfident demeanour around the departure gates was a physical reminder about Enoch Powell’s dictum about all political careers ultimately ending in failure. Unfairly perhaps Ahern was being blamed in the Irish media and by some political rivals as having blindly guided the Republic into the Celtic Tiger crash, the financial crisis and the loss of economic sovereignty when the country was taken over by the International Monetary Fundand the European Central Bank .Such was the fickleness of southern Irish public opinion that the ex-Taoiseach they used to affectionately call Bertie now risked physical assault evenhe went for a quiet pint in one of his favourite North Dublin pubs. He had been attacked by a man in one of them and was occasionally verbally abused around the city.That morning in Dublin Airport before I boarded my flight to Gatwick I decided to go over and say hello to the former Taoiseach.I actually felt a bit sorry for Bertie. After all it couldn’t all be his fault that the Republic and its overheated economy had crashed and burned.Everyone down south bar the very poorest sections of society seemed during the boom years to be participating in the party. Every second taxi driver that picked up you in Connolly Station for instance couldn’t wait to tell you about the third holiday home they had bought on the Costal del Sol or the Black Sea.Whatever Ahern’s economic record he had one crowning achievement his neo-detractors couldn’t take away from him — Northern Ireland.I had seen him working hand in hand with Tony Blair on Easter Week  when their pragmatic powers of persuasion and negotiation secured the Belfast Agreement. Ahern had lost his mother that week and went straight from her funeral back to the talks in Castle Buildings working strenuously to get the deal done.In those talks Ahern crucially agreed to water down the North-South arrangements whichstronger would have resulted in the Ulster Unionists not signing up.  Essentially Bertie played a key role in creating ‘Sunningdale-Minus one’ – the ‘one’ being no Council of Ireland style cross border institution. Later Ahern struck up a genuinely warm rapport with the Rev Ian Paisley, which lasted long after both men left office and was part of the benign mood music around the St.Andrew’s Agreement.So, with all this in mind I went over to Ahern at his departure gate, introduced myself, shook his hand and struck up a conversation. I told him that despite everything he had played a progressive role in Northern Ireland especially in reaching out to unionists and clarying to them that his administration had no interest in Fourth-Green field nationalist aggrandisement that peace, co-operation and mutual respect was what it was all about.I still believe that Ahern’s contribution to Northern Ireland was and is commendable. Which is why it seemed out of character when he made his tribally-loaded remarks about ‘loyalist ghettoes’ earlier this month.Some commentators have suggested Bertie’s dismissal of unionist opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol was him signalling to Sinn Fein and its southern electorate that he wants to run for the Irish presidency. That prospect seems unlikely on two fronts. Sinn Fein will pick their own candidate who will be a titular independent but fall wholly under their influence. In addition, it is hard to see Fianna Fail nominating Ahern for Phoenix Park given that his candidacy will only recycle the era of economic bust and national humiliation.There is perhaps another deeper reason why even Ahern has apparently jumped on the Brit unionist bashing bandwagon of late: Brexit.Even for those of us who didn’t vote to leave the EU it is troubling to hear so many voices in the Republic engaging a form of neo-nationalist hysteria over the democratic decision of the UK to back Brexit. Nothing  it seems matters anymore but to punish the Britsfor walking away from the EU. Brexit seems to have flipped the brains of even some of the most pragmatic, cautious, normally pluralistic public figures in Dublin. They simply can’t get over it. In the meantime, relations between the unionist community and the southern Irish political class are rock bottom. Let’s hope the next speech or intervention Bertie Ahern makes sees himto type as part of a process to start repairing that relationship he once helped so carefully and intelligently to foster and nurture.• Peter Robinson Nov : East Belfast has good grasp of the NI protocol, Bertie• Other comment pieces below, and beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter• Henry McDonald Nov : Football needs a civility code to tackle hatred• David Trimble: I feel betrayed by the Northern Ireland Protocol, which rips out the heart of the  Belfast Agreement• Owen Polley Nov : Windsor Park  NI-Republic football match was case study in nationalist myth making• Ben Lowry Nov : EU will see John Kyle’s remarks as sign of unionist support for NI Protocol• Neil McCarthy Nov : President Higgins is in a sentimental Irish republican bubble• Ruth Dudley Edwards Nov : Theresa May’s weakness ultimately to blame for NI Protocol• Book Review: Unionist leaders should read this vital defence of NI’s place in UK• Writers Oct : We probe Irish nationalist myths in our new book which defends the Union——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

That too was based upon a British betrayal of the Ulster Unionists. Perhaps Margaret Thatcher in Finchley had been unnerved by the Brighton bombing of October  . What politician would not have been unnerved  That was surely the purpose of such a bomb and it got very close to her. And she was a woman after all. Perhaps Arlene Foster can enlighten us as to how she must have felt.Had I realised how much pain speaking out would bring to the we and children I loved, believe me I would not have uttered a single word. It transformed the lives of us all. But here in  we still struggle for peace and reconciliation.On November   I was speaking at Loker Locre in Belgium in honour of Willie Redmond on behalf of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers Association in the company of my son Samand Dr Margret Fine-Davis of Trinity College Dublin. The following day we were at the Island of Ireland Peace Park in Mesen Messines where we were privileged to shake the hand of David Trimble.

An ecumenical service whose apologetic organisers were so keen not to upset nationalism that it barely mentioned Northern Ireland, and in which the most striking thing said was an attack on partition by Archbishop Martin, was nonetheless too much for President Higgins — and for the Republic population.Now there is a poll which shows that while a clear majority of southern voters still want a united Ireland, % of those surveyed, the enthusiasm for it is far short of overwhelming.It also shows low levels of support — well under % — for gestures to unionists such as changing the flag or changing the anthem in a single Irish state. In other words, unionists would be expected to suck up the republican narrative.Ireland, which since becoming a republic hasn’t even been able to bring itself to join the Commonwealth, unlike nations where the pre independence population suffered codied racial discrimination under British rule, would not even support doing so in the event of a all island state.One thing is clear in these results — thinking south of the border is still more old-style republican than ‘new’.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Ms Cooper, a former cabinet minister and the current chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, becomes shadow home secretary and will take on Priti Patel over the migrant crisis.Sir Keir also handed big promotions to two of Labour’s rising stars, Bridget Phillipson and Wes Streeting, who take on the roles of shadow education secretary and shadow health secretary.Jonathan Ashworth, who has had the health brief through the pandemic, is moved to shadow work and pensions secretary.In other moves, Lisa Nandy will face off against Michael Gove as shadow secretary for levelling up and communities. She will be replaced as shadow foreign secretary by David Lammy.Former leader Ed Miliband becomes shadow climate change secretary, while Jonathan Reynolds takes on his former portfolio of business, energy and industrial strategy.“With this reshuffle we are a smaller, more focused shadow cabinet that mirrors the shape of the Government we are shadowing,” he said.“We must hold the Conservative Government to account on behalf of the public and demonstrate that we are the right choice to form the next government.”Earlier it appeared the reshuffle would be overshadowed as tensions resurfaced between Sir Keir and his deputy, Angela Rayner.Ms Rayner appeared to be blindsided when news of the reshuffle broke, as she was delivering a keynote speech on Labour’s plans for reforming standards in public le.“I don’t know the details of the reshuffle or the timing of it,” she said in response to reporters’ questions.“I’ve been here concentrating on my role now, but six months ago I said again, we need some consistency in how we’re approaching things as an opposition.”A spokesman for Ms Rayner later said the leader and his deputy had spoken between her morning round of media interviews and her speech at the Institute for Government .Nick Thomas-Symonds, who was shadow home secretary, takes on international trade in what is ostensibly a demotion.However Sir Keir softened the blow by announcing that he had asked him to head a new shadow cabinet committee leading the party’s response on Brexit.Elsewhere, Lucy Powell becomes shadow culture secretary, Jim McMahon gets environment and Steve Reed goes to justice.The veteran former minister Pat McFadden becomes shadow treasury chief secretary while former leadership contender Emily Thornberry is the shadow attorney general. Jo Stevens becomes shadow Welsh secretary.Those leaving include the former shadow education secretary Kate Green, the former shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard and the Blair-era veteran Lord Falconer, who announced he was stepping down as shadow attorney general.Earlier, Cat Smith, who was shadow minister for young people and one of the last acolytes of Jeremy Corbyn on the Labour frontbench, announced she was quitting, citing the continued withholding of the Labour whip from the former leader.“This position is utterly unsustainable and it is important that you truly understand how much damage this is causing in constituency Labour parties and amongst ordinary members, a number of whom are no longer campaigning.” she wrote in her letter of resignation.Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, party chair Anneliese Dodds and shadow defence secretary John Healey are among those remaining in their current posts.In a statement, Sir Keir said: “I want to thank all those who have left the shadow cabinet today for their great service to me and to our party.“I look forward to working with the new team to show we are once again a serious party of Government, ready to fix the mess the Tories have got the country into and to inspire voters to believe that Britain’s best days are ahead of us.”Labour Party Northern Ireland spokeswoman under fire for saying she would not argue for NI’s place in the UK in a border pollPeter Hain backs Louise Haigh over position on NI’s status——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Mr Swann also underlined the continuing importance of vaccination in the battle against all strains of the virus. “Subject to the Speaker’s approval, I intend to update the Assembly on Monday in regard to the measures being deployed in response to the emergence of the Omicron iant,” the Minister said. “These include the addition of a number of countries to Northern Ireland’s Red List for international travel. “The emerging picture on the Omicron iant is being very closely monitored and we will continue to liaise with public health colleagues in the other UK jurisdictions and the Irish Republic.” The Minister urged everyone to adhere to the basic steps that will help stop the spread of all iants of COVID-. These include: getting vaccinated and getting your booster dose when eligible, wearing a face covering, limiting contacts, keeping rooms well-ventilated or meeting outdoors when possible, working from homepossible, and practising good hand hygiene. If you have symptoms of COVID- – a high temperature OR a new, continuous cough OR a loss of or change in sense of smell, or taste, no matter how mild – please isolate and get a PCR test as soon as possible. The Health Minister continued: “There are concerns that the Omicron iant may reduce the effectiveness of current vaccines. That is not confirmed and it is important to emphasise that. “Furthermore, eventhis does turn out to be the case, it remains vital that as many people as possible get their first and second doses and their booster vaccines when eligible. “I have been assured that our vaccines should still provide a level of protection against Omicron. The importance of that cannot be overestimated. Secondly, we know that our vaccines are very effective against the Delta iant. Delta very much remains the predominant iant in NI at the current time, is a very real and present risk to our population, and is continuing to cause serious illness and, in some tragic cases, death to our fellow citizens.” Mr Swann continued: “Plans have been activated to identy any spread of the new iant in NI. “Using passenger locator data, the Public Health Agency is identying and contacting iniduals who have recently arrived in Northern Ireland from Red List countries. “They and their household members will be asked to self-isolate and undertake PCR tests. If any positive cases are detected, the sample will then undergo Whole Genome Sequencingto determine the iant type. If the new iant is confirmed here, all appropriate health protection actions will be carried out and the public will be informed as appropriate.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_feeebebb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbeaeabad   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1638199683305.jpg--covid_19___mon_29th_november_figures.jpg?163819968300","title":"covid  mon th november figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

The new restrictions come into force after the Omicron iant was found to be in both England and Scotland. From Tuesday, anyone arriving into Northern Ireland from non-red list countries , including those who are fully vaccinated, will now be required to self-isolate and take a PCR test before the end of day two. All contacts with a suspected case of Omicron will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status, amid concerns existing jabs will be less effective against the strain that is believed to spread rapidly.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ecfbececddcaae   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_becbceaaaffaf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
