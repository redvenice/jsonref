The event takes its name from the 1976 comedy movie The Gumball Rally and raises funds for youth projects.Cooper also reportedly chose the term ‘Gumball’ to describe the rally because iconic artist Andy Warhol used it to describe the way that the population chews up and eventually spits out pop culture like gum.The inaugural rally, in which Cooper and about 50 of his friends participated, took place between London and Rimini, Italy, passing through cities like Paris along the way.The 2001 rally, which stretched between London and Berlin, Germany, is often seen as a turning point for the race as its popularity and global awareness rose sharply around that time.In 2002, the rally moved from Europe to the United States, starting in New York City and ending in Los Angeles, California, passing iconic landmarks like the White House in Washington, D.C. and the Grand Canyon in Arizona along the way.In 2004, the race returned to Europe, taking place between Paris and Cannes, France. Sadly, the 2007 rally ended early after a traffic accident in Macedonia resulted in the deaths of two nonparticipants.The 2008 and 2009 rallies were held entirely in the United States while the 2010 rally was notably the first transatlantic race as participants were flown between Europe and the U.S. The 2014 and 2015 rallies also featured a similar transatlantic route, flying participants between Miami, Florida and Ibiza, Spain in 2014 and Stockholm, Sweden and Las Vegas in 2015.When is the 2018 Gumball 3000 Rally?The rally is set to begin on Saturday, August 4 and continue until Sunday, August 12.2018 Gumball 3000 Rally trophyTo commemorate the 20th anniversary of the rally, Asprey has made a new ‘Spirit of Gumball’ trophy to mark the event. Modelled after a vintage gumball machine, it will be revealed to the public at the rally’s official launch party in London.Asprey Chairman John Rigas expressed enthusiasm at being part of the celebrity motor rally, stating: ‘We are delighted to host Gumball at the Asprey Mayfair flagship and thrilled to join the Gumball 3000 rally. It is a very exciting route this year through beautiful parts of Europe and continuing through important cities in Japan, one of the most beautiful countries in the world.’Meghan Markle\u0027s birthday wish every year is inspired by her motherCulture Club tour 2018: All you need to know about the UK datesGreat British Bake Off 2018: Start date, judges, trailer and more revealedGumball 3000 Rally 2018: All you need to know about the 20th anniversary race from London to TokyoGame of Thrones star Maisie Williams launches Daisie appPrince Harry and Meghan Markle told friends \u0027if you talk to the press you\u0027re out\u0027Station 19 season 2: All you need to know about the Grey\u0027s Anatomy spin-offStephen Colbert slams Ivanka Trump on The Late Show asking \u0027what do you do?\u0027Could Love Island be axed because of Brexit? Fortnite\u0027s Week 4 challenges: Search between a gas station, soccer pitch and Stunt MountainFA Community Shield 2018 - Chelsea vs Manchester City: When is it and what TV channel is it on?As Jennifer Aniston and Kim Kardashian reveal their weight, here\u0027s what your favorite celebs weigh Who is Gul Panag?

Always more inspiration.’Also in 2016, shortly after she started dating Prince Harry, Markle wrote: ‘I am feeling so incredibly joyful right now, so grateful and content that all I could wish for is more of the same.’Two years earlier in 2014, Markle also expressed happiness on her website, writing: \u0027I am 33 years old today. And I am happy. And I say that so plainly because, well…it takes time. To be happy. To figure out how to be kind to yourself. To not just choose that happiness, but to feel it.\u0027So for my birthday, here’s what I would like as a gift: I want you to be kind to yourself. I want you to challenge yourself.\u0027I want you to stop gossiping, to try a food that scares you, to buy a coffee for someone just because, to tell someone you love them…and then to tell yourself right back. I want you to find your happiness.\u0027Markle used her blog as a platform to express her feelings about her personal life and past experiences growing up as well. In one post, she described the ‘constant battle’ of her ‘brutal’ 20s that involved incessantly judging her own weight and style choices.           Markle used her now-defunct blog to express personal feelings and recount past experiences\u0027My 20s were brutal – a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as coolas hipas smartas “whatever” as everyone else.\u0027My teens were even worse – grappling with how to fit in, and what that even meant. My high school had cliques: the black girls and white girls, the Filipino and the Latina girls.\u0027Being biracial, I fell somewhere in between. So every day during lunch, I busied myself with meetings – French club, student body, whatever one could possibly do between noon and 1pm, I was there. Not so that I was more involved, but so that I wouldn’t have to eat alone,’ she wrote.For her birthday, Markle is reportedly planning to celebrate in Surrey at the wedding of Daisy Jenks and Charlie Van Straubenzee, one of Prince Harry’s best friends who also served as an usher at the Royal Wedding.Per Royal tradition, birthdays are usually low-key affairs celebrated at home. A notable exception is Queen Elizabeth II, who celebrates two birthdays in April and June.August 4 is also notable in the Royal Family as its marks what would’ve been the 118th birthday of the late Queen Mother, who was born on that date in 1900.Who is Doria Ragland?Doria Ragland is the mother of Meghan Markle.She was born in Cleveland, Ohio in September, 1956.

It has led to repeated attempts by Left-wing activists in the pro-Corbyn Momentum group to sack her as MP for Liverpool Riverside.A former aide to Mr Corbyn told The Mail on Sunday that they had heard him describe Dame Louise sarcastically as \u0027the Honourable Member for Tel Aviv\u0027 when her name was mentioned. \u0027I was very surprised and when I asked other members of staff they said he often did it in private, though not to her face,\u0027 said the Labour insider.          The \u0027spiteful\u0027 jibe by the Labour leader was reportedly aimed at Louise Ellman (pictured)Another senior Labour source said Dame Louise was commonly referred to as \u0027the Hon Member of Tel Aviv\u0027 by members of Mr Corbyn\u0027s staff. \u0027If her name crops up, or she appears on the office TV, they\u0027ll say, \u0027There she goes again, the Honourable member for Tel Aviv.\u0027 They can\u0027t stand her.\u0027 Last night, Stephen Pollard, editor of the Jewish Chronicle, condemned Mr Corbyn\u0027s \u0027spiteful\u0027 comment.Born into a Jewish family in Manchester, Dame Louise, 72, was chairman of the Jewish Labour Movement until 2016 and is vice chairman of the Labour Friends of Israel.

Labour has become an institutionally anti-Semitic Party under Jeremy Corbyn.

But the CPRE said there was no need to pave over the countryside when there are sufficient urban ‘brownfield’ sites in towns and cities that could provide some 720,000 homes.Brownfield sites include wasteland, derelict or disused sites such as old warehouses or factories.The CPRE said that over the past six years ‘too many local authorities and developers have been taking a lax view of what exceptional means... allocating green belt sites for development as an easy option rather than as a last resort.’          Today’s CPRE report, The State of the Green Belt, said: ‘Our key findings show that the Government has broken its promise to secure the green belt\u0027 (Protesters in Borehamwood campaigning against development on green belt land)The CPRE also calculated that of the homes built on the green belt in the past nine years, 72 per cent were not ‘affordable’ under the Government’s definitions, so they do little to reduce the housing shortage.Critics fear it may become even easier to build on green belt land.Last year the Government unveiled its Housing White Paper containing ambitious plans to build a million new homes by 2020. It said the green belt would not lose any of its protections. But critics noted ‘exceptional circumstances’ could include housing requirements – in effect watering down safeguards.Tom Fyans, of the CPRE, said: ‘We are being sold a lie by many developers. As they sell off and gobble up the green belt to build low-density, unaffordable housing, young families go on struggling to afford a place to live.‘The affordable housing crisis must be addressed with increasing urgency, while acknowledging that far from providing the solution, building on the green belt only serves to entrench the issue. The Government is failing in its commitment to protect the green belt – it is being eroded at an alarming rate.’The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ‘We are clear building the homes our country needs does not mean tearing up our countryside.‘Last year the number of new homes built was the highest in a decade, and only 0.02 per cent of the green belt was developed for residential use.‘We are adding more certainty to the planning system and our new rulebook strengthens national protections for the green belt.’   We\u0027re fighting to half houses here... public services just cannot copeby Sami QuadriHundreds of residents have launched a campaign to stop new houses and a school being built on green belt land near their homes.They have taken to the streets with placards and chanted ‘Hands off green belt!’ in a demonstration against the development that would bring 58 houses and a primary school.          Hundreds of residents have launched a campaign to stop new houses and a school being built on green belt land near their homes in Borehamwood Claire Crossan, 61, said the building project in Well End, near Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, will do little to help people get on the housing ladder, while putting pressure on public services. ‘It will without doubt put a strain on public services,’ said Mrs Crossan, who leads the Well End Ers group. ‘People are screaming for hospital appointments.‘The roads are congested, Borehamwood doesn’t have any infrastructure.‘It was well-known for being a semi-rural place but we’re getting very overcrowded.’ Mrs Crossan and her group are dismayed that land currently used for farming, which is popular with families, dog walkers and horse riders, will be lost.She said of the national move towards 460,000 new homes on green belt land: ‘These figures are disappointing and lots of rural parts of the country will be hit hard by this, including mine.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/06/03/4C3B68BA00000578-6029711-Meghan_and_her_father_haven_t_been_on_speaking_terms_since_Thoma-a-5_1533521854917.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles half sister says Duchess NOT flying reconcile father","story":"Meghan Markle\u0027s half-sister Samantha has vehemently denied recent reports that the Duchess is planning to reunite with their estranged father Thomas later this month, telling the Sun: \u0027I speak to him every day and it\u0027s sad but, no, they have not contacted him\u0027  Meghan and her father haven\u0027t been on speaking terms since Thomas pulled out of her wedding to Prince Harry in May, citing health concerns Putting her troubles behind her!

The crisis erupted last month after Labour’s ruling NEC – dominated by Corbynistas – refused to adopt the full internationally-accepted definition of anti-Semitism.It meant that the party’s code of conduct only accepts seven of the 11 examples of anti-Semitism as defined by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. The Jewish News has reported that Mr Corbyn now plans to incorporate another three examples.Trump fires off furious tweet at \u0027Fake News\u0027 calling press...Hook-handed cleric Abu Hamza heaps praise on ‘noble’ Donald...Share this articleThey include the idea that it is anti-Semitic to compare contemporary Israeli policies to those of the Nazis, and holding Israel to different standards to other democratic countries.But it is understood Mr Corbyn is still unwilling to move on the final example, of denying Jewish people have a right to self-determination – for example by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a ‘racist endeavour’.Labour did not dismiss the report last night. Jewish community leaders have demanded the party incorporate all 11 examples.          It comes after Labour deputy leader Tom Watson (pictured) warned the party faces being lost in a \u0027vortex of eternal shame\u0027 unless it addresses the concerns of the Jewish communityYesterday, in a new video, Mr Corbyn said driving out anti-Semitism and working with the Jewish community were ‘vital priorities’.He apologised for the hurt caused by the crisis, but made no mention, for example, of his decision to host an event in Parliament where Israel was compared to the Nazis. He was also filmed at a rally in 2010 comparing the plight of the Palestinians with those who suffered the Nazi sieges of Leningrad and Stalingrad.Last night Labour Friends of Israel said Mr Corbyn’s words would continue to lack credibility so long as he refused to apologise ‘for the many occasions on which he himself has offended the Jewish community’. Gideon Falter of the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism said: ‘It is just another contradictory, hypocritical, insincere attempt to whitewash his own role as the author of this nightmare.’Tal Ofer, member of the Board of Deputies, tweeted: ‘You had three years, you did nothing. Time to go.’ Karen Pollock, of the Holocaust Education Trust, said: ‘False equivocations, denial and distortion of the Holocaust are incorrect, inappropriate, hurtful and wrong. Why in 2018 do we still find ourselves having to explain the offence this causes to not only Holocaust survivors, but to the Jewish community? To do it once is a mistake, twice perhaps careless, but multiple times? Deliberate.’In a joint statement, the Board of Deputies and the Jewish Leadership Council said: ‘He should remember that inaction in the face of racism is complicity.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/05/19/4EDBD91D00000578-0-image-m-5_1533492721698.jpg","title":"ANDREW PIERCE Jeremy Corbyn putting big left foot it","story":"    Even the most ardent of Comrade Corbyn’s supporters must concede that his much vaunted fight back against anti-Semitism has imploded spectacularlyIn a video message, the Labour leader had urged his Party members to attend ‘Southwark Transformed’, an event held on Saturday in London by Momentum, the hard-Left organisation established to bolster Corbyn’s leadership.One of the speakers was none other than Marc Wadsworth, a veteran Corbyn supporter who, in 2016, had been involved in a verbal confrontation with Jewish Labour MP Ruth Smeeth.

She denounced Mr Corbyn for hosting a Holocaust Memorial Day event during which the Israeli government was compared to the Nazis.In 2016, she backed a motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn by rebel Labour MPs.A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said last night the claim that he had called Dame Louise \u0027the MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 was \u0027a fabrication\u0027.The disclosure of Mr Corbyn\u0027s role at the 2012 pro-Palestine rally follows claims last week that he chaired a meeting in Parliament in 2010 in which a speaker compared Israel\u0027s actions to the Nazis.Video footage of the 2012 meeting hosted in Conway Hall, Holborn, London by the Palestine Solidary Campaign shows the poem Love Letters To Gaza being recited by an actress. It was reportedly applauded by Mr Corbyn. The poem refers to an attempt by an unofficial \u0027freedom\u0027 flotilla of ships to break the blockade imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip in 2011.It includes the lines: \u0027It is not now the Nazi state but Israel that blocks the seas.It is not Auschwitz that stops the ship that carries hope and messages,But those that might have died there....The victims are now the torturers.\u0027Mr Corbyn was also highly critical of Israel in his speech at the meeting, which featured a backdrop comprising a map showing Palestine in place of Israel.Labour\u0027s anti-Semitism revolt grew last night as Emily Benn, granddaughter of late Left-winger Tony Benn, said the only way to solve Labour\u0027s anti-Semitic rift was to sack Mr Corbyn.His statement was \u0027utter rubbish\u0027, tweeted former Labour parliamentary candidate Ms Benn, niece of senior Labour MP Hilary Benn.          \u0027To refer to me as the \u0027MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 is to challenge my loyalty to this country,\u0027 said Dame Louise Ellman of Corbyn\u0027s comment\u0027No responsibility taken for the anti-Semitism and those anti-Semites he has supported for years. Labour has become an institutionally anti-Semitic Party under Jeremy Corbyn. It will not change while he is leader.\u0027 Dame Louise said last night: \u0027If this is correct, I am appalled that a potential Prime Minister would use language of this sort against one of his own MPs.\u0027To refer to me as the \u0027MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 is to challenge my loyalty to this country.\u0027A key part the internationally accepted code on anti-Semitism which the Labour Party wants to dilute specifically states it is anti-Semitic to accuse Jews of being more loyal to Israel than to their own country.\u0027A Labour spokesman said last night that the allegation that Mr Corbyn had called Dame Louise the \u0027MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 was \u0027entirely untrue\u0027. He also said, in relation to the 2012 pro-Palestinian meeting, that Mr Corbyn \u0027was not responsible for everything said at every meeting he has ever attended\u0027."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/05/16/4EC402FA00000578-6028685-image-a-45_1533481374129.jpg","title":"David Cameron brands Michael Gove lunatic blames EU referendum defeat","story":"    David Cameron, pictured in July 2016, has launched a scathing attack on Michael Gove, calling him a \u0027lunatic\u0027 and blaming him for defeat in the EU referendum          Environment Secretary Michael Gove speaking in the National Trust Theatre on the opening day of BBC Countryfile Live at Blenheim Palace, near Woodstock, in Oxfordshire.

Researchers blamed over-crowded wards and staffing shortages, but NHS officials insisted the rise was mostly down to better classification.Sepsis occurs when the body over-reacts to an everyday infection or virus. It is commonly triggered by a skin infection, chest infection, pneumonia or the flu.The illness is notoriously difficult to diagnose and patients\u0027 risk of death significantly increases for every hour they are not given antibiotics.The alert system developed by Cambridge University Hospitals works by constantly analysing patients\u0027 observations, as recorded by staff on handheld devices.

They are now working alongside NHS England to roll it out in other hospitals.There are 250,000 cases of sepsis in the UK each year and it claims 44,000 lives, meaning one in six patients will die. The Mail has been campaigning to improve the care of patients with sepsis since 2016, following the tragic case of one-year-old William Mead.He died from the condition in Treliske Hospital, near Truro in Cornwall after GPs and other staff missed the warning signs.

The blueprint has been written by clinicians and people on the front-line and they know what works.\u0027The only way for doctors to diagnose sepsis is to closely monitor patients\u0027 breathing, temperature, blood pressure, blood oxygen and alertness. But many patients who go to A\u0026ampE are seen by different doctors and nurses who take different measurements. This means no one health professional is looking at all the measurements together, and checking to see if they have worsened.Cambridge University Hospitals Trust introduced the system in the A\u0026ampE unit of its main hospital Addenbrookes in August 2016. In July 2015, only 11 per cent of patients with possible sepsis were given antibiotics within an hour of arriving at A\u0026ampE. This had increased to 76 per cent by August 2016. Since then the figure has ranged from 72 to 86 per cent.Dr Sian Coggle, an infectious diseases consultant who is the trust\u0027s clinical lead for sepsis, said: \u0027It\u0027s not just lives saved, it\u0027s the whole morbidity associated with severe sepsis.

Jewish community leaders have demanded the party incorporate all 11 examples.          It comes after Labour deputy leader Tom Watson (pictured) warned the party faces being lost in a \u0027vortex of eternal shame\u0027 unless it addresses the concerns of the Jewish communityYesterday, in a new video, Mr Corbyn said driving out anti-Semitism and working with the Jewish community were ‘vital priorities’.He apologised for the hurt caused by the crisis, but made no mention, for example, of his decision to host an event in Parliament where Israel was compared to the Nazis. He was also filmed at a rally in 2010 comparing the plight of the Palestinians with those who suffered the Nazi sieges of Leningrad and Stalingrad.Last night Labour Friends of Israel said Mr Corbyn’s words would continue to lack credibility so long as he refused to apologise ‘for the many occasions on which he himself has offended the Jewish community’. Gideon Falter of the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism said: ‘It is just another contradictory, hypocritical, insincere attempt to whitewash his own role as the author of this nightmare.’Tal Ofer, member of the Board of Deputies, tweeted: ‘You had three years, you did nothing.

Eating nightly at Leon was weird enough – then the problems really started ...Rachel Maclean saturates her work with the discordant visuals of a modern nightmare – insatiable emojis, petticoated twerkers, wax-faced techno monks chanting their desire for data. But it was Birmingham’s Bullring that gave the multimedia artist anxiety dreams of her own.Maclean, who is based in Glasgow and represented Scotland at last year’s Venice Biennale, spent a month working, eating and sleeping in Birmingham’s mammoth shopping centre, by the end of which she had completed a short and startling film based on her experience. Channel 4 had asked her to participate in a series called Artists in Residence, for which a performance artist was also embedded in a sex clinic and a portrait painter spent a season with West Bromwich Albion football club. Maclean’s immersive sojourn was, she recalls from the sanity-restoring distance of a year later, “the residency from hell”. She says that she has done her best to avoid shopping centres since the filming was completed in August 2017.Laughing in her Bridgeton studio, which is stuffed with wigs, masks and racks of the candy-coloured costumes that make up her instantly recognisable aesthetic, she says: “If you imagine the conventional idea of an artists’ residence: you go somewhere remote, you’re living with other like-minded people and cooking for each other and chatting about art. It’s the comfort zone. Being in the Bullring was completely the opposite.”With her background in satirising the excesses of consumer culture, as with the infantilised adults and horror children in 2015’s Feed Me, one might imagine that Maclean would have tougher armour than most, but the relentless visuals of consumption took their toll. “There’s something about shopping centres and the whole experience of advertising that is anxiety-inducing. It has to make you feel bad in order that you buy something to make yourself feel better. It’s an entire culture that necessitates dissatisfaction.” Feeding herself became a similarly suffocating experience: “I had Cafe Nero, Pret a Manger, and Leon. I had dinner every night at Leon and even the food can be saturated by that strange environment.”The film tracks Maclean’s thwarted attempts to engage creatively with her surroundings. The only brand that would allow her to film in its shop was Smiggle, purveyor of unicorn-embossed children’s stationery that shares much of its aesthetic with Maclean’s. Even then, she was limited to asking the manager two pre-approved questions: “Tell me about Smiggle?” and “How long have you worked here?” (It should be noted that Maclean remains entirely respectful of Bullring employees. Having worked in retail, she is well aware of the slog of customer service.)A year on from the residency, Maclean’s frustration is far more transparent than it is in the documentary. “Every idea I had and everything I tried to do gradually seemed less possible. What I hadn’t considered is that these places feel like a public space, but the minute you try to critique or satirise it you hit up against all these things: I wasn’t allowed to film in shops, I couldn’t make work inspired by certain shops legally – the possible avenues for making art were narrowed down. So eventually the only way was to make art about the level of censorship around these brands.”It was a worthy target, as Maclean points out. “A lot of large corporations are financially bigger than some nations, more powerful than governments, but if we weren’t permitted to satirise governments using their own iconography then that would seem like a hard level of censorship.”In the resulting film, Maclean uses prosthetics and a hand-stitched costume to recreate herself as the marauding Satisfaction Bunny, a nursery monstrosity with viciously sharp teeth, who romps through an alternate Bullring universe peopled with tantrum-throwing shoppers craving brands, their logos censored with pixels. Like her other work, the film uses green-screen technology and digital editing while Maclean herself lip-syncs to a prerecorded soundtrack. The final piece of work is, if anything, enriched by her struggles her tangible rage, in particular at the way women’s bodies are variously used by consumer capitalism, remains undiminished. Not that Maclean’s work could ever be described as po-faced: it is infused with playfulness and cheek.“I’ve always thought dressing up was fun, ever since I was a kid,” she says. “Gender identity, particularly for women, traps you into a very narrow, restrictive idea of what beauty is, but dressing up and performance allow you to play with it.”Maclean’s costumes are artworks in themselves, exhaustingly elaborate, made in garish colours, with jarring details such as accentuated teeth, overly wide eyes or melting skin. “There’s a strange power in the grotesque, instead of trying to achieve beauty – and the standards of beauty as set at this level where it is entirely unachievable, and purposely so because if it was achievable you maybe wouldn’t want to keep buying these things to look better. But grotesqueness can be achieved quite easily and purposefully. There’s something cheeky that I find strangely empowering in being these grotesque characters.”Given Maclean’s ad-busting hinterland, it’s perhaps a wonder that any shopping centre allowed her within its bounds. She says that Channel 4 and Firecrest, the producers, sounded out a number of venues before the Bullring agreed. “I don’t think I ever got to the bottom of why they said yes,” she says.Her interactions with Pete Cooper, UK director of Hammerson, the property company that owns the Bullring, were her greatest disappointment, she says. But they were also fairly predictable, considering his position: one scene shows his flabbergasted expression after viewing Maclean’s Bullring artwork for the first time. “That’s pretty interesting!” he squeaks. And Maclean is also refreshingly aware of when her own artist’s ego impinges on her response. “You go into a shopping centre and you’re almost inside the belly of the whale but in the best circumstances you give the whale indigestion. And talking to Pete, his response was so strangely patronising that it gave me this feeling, ‘You can just absorb this, can’t you?’ And that’s the scary thing about consumer capitalism – the extent it can absorb things.”It was a shock after the cosy confirmation bias of her usual artistic milieu. “Within the art world, you have a certain ego because you’re among people who agree with you that we’re counter to this culture and can do things that speak of something that’s critical of it. The minute you’re dumped into this world you feel so strangely powerless.”She describes seeing “feminist”-branded T-shirts on the girls’ clothing rails in Primark: “One of the really good things recently is that feminism is back on the agenda and it has become something that young women are talking about, but look how easily a radical politics can be absorbed into consumerism, and can those two things coexist?”Responses to her residency from the public were more galvanising, she says, despite the Birmingham Mail’s headline: “What this bizarre looking woman is doing in the Bullring”.“That was really good fun. We had loads of different people in and out.” Maclean had set herself up in a shop space for the month, inviting members of the public in to comment on early iterations of her film props, watch her earlier work on screen and answer the question she plastered across her shop window in huge yellow letters: Are you satisfied? She also recruited extras to run around the Bullring for her final shoot. “Galleries can seem intimidating to people, while shops feel as if they are welcoming you in. So that was nice about being in a shopping centre – you didn’t have the aura of exclusivity around what you were doing.“That was why I was really keen to do a TV programme,” she says, “because I feel right now is a difficult time for public art in the UK. A lot of institutions are losing their funding and it feels like the whole position of artists and institutions that are not solely commercial is becoming really precarious.

Practically, it’s exhausting.“The problem is I’m just hooked on making art, I don’t think I can stop, and I’ve thought about it.

To explain his predicament and his dejected air, just look at his location. He is standing in Queens, across the river from Manhattan although the Queensboro Bridge connects the factories and taxi garages of Long Island City with the penthouses and roof gardens of the Upper East Side, he remains stranded in what snooty Manhattanites call “the outer boroughs”.In the hazy distance, the skyscrapers of midtown Manhattan are out of reach and almost out of sight. Under the bridge’s anchorage there is another barrier – the ruins of the asylums, quarantine hospitals and penitentiaries on Roosevelt Island, a sliver of rock in the East River where New York once confined those it considered insane, infectious or unrespectable. In the 1920s Mae West was briefly locked up there as punishment for being too sexy (though she revenged herself by romancing the prison warden). Half a century after Evelyn Hofer took the photograph, the exclusion zone has widened. That grassy verge has been privatised: the Queens shoreline is now occupied by a glazed rampart of forbiddingly expensive apartment towers. Roosevelt Island too is a dormitory for the rich, with a park that ironically commemorates the American freedoms extolled by President Franklin D Roosevelt – elusive ideals, still not available to\u0026nbspall.Hofer’s subject is pausing to consider his options.

The research was funded by VicHealth and the National Health and Medical Research Council.Lead researcher Dr Lan Gao from Deakin said spending excessive amounts of time sitting at a desk was associated with serious diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. It could also be a factor in reduced life expectancy.“Adopting this workplace intervention also has the potential to reduce absenteeism and improve productivity,” Gao said. “The introduction of sit-stand desks, alongside associated supports, is a cost-effective and innovative way to promote the health of Australia’s workforce.”The study found the net cost of providing workers with sit-stand desks was about at $344 per person, but Dr Gao said this could be reduced by economies of scale with bulk orders and sharing workstations. “Ultimately this intervention has the potential to make a very significant and sustainable positive impact on reducing workplace sitting time, but most importantly it is also cost-effective, which we know is critical in making the case for a wider rollout of this program,” she said.Official advice from the National Health and Medical Research council says sedentary behaviour is associated with poorer health outcome.“There is currently not enough evidence to make a recommendation on the specific duration of sitting or lying down that is associated with poorer health outcomes. However, it is recommended to break up time spent sitting or lying down, as often as possible.”It also warns that the emerging evidence suggests that the ill-effects of sedentary behaviour cannot be overcome by exercise.Other studies have cast doubt on the health benefits of sit-stand work stations.Researchers at Exeter University in the UK and University College London followed more than 5,000 people over a 16-year period and found sitting down was no worse for you than standing up as long as you had regular exercise. “Any stationary posture where energy expenditure is low may be detrimental to health, be it sitting or standing,” said Melvyn Hillsdon from Exeter’s sport and health sciences department.“The results cast doubt on the benefits of sit-stand work stations, which employers are increasingly providing to promote healthy working environments.”The research found there was no influence on mortality risk for participants from sitting at work, during leisure time or watching television."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6786d839486349b6d07da9a3619e1d8d1cc7bbc8/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5b66fac433880c4779f660b0c843d174 1320w","title":"wizz air was least punctual airline flying from uk last year","story":"Airline cites severe winter weather for 23-minute average delays shown by CAA data Wizz Air has the worst punctuality record of the busiest airlines operating from UK airports, an investigation has found.The Hungarian carrier’s UK departures were an average of 23 minutes late in 2017, according to Press Association analysis of Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) data.Norwegian Air Shuttle has the second-worst performance, followed by Vueling Airlines, Thomas Cook Airlines and BMI Regional.The ranking covers 44 airlines that had at least 2,000 scheduled flights from UK airports last year.Average delay figures take into account every flight that operated, including those that were on time. Cancelled services are excluded from the CAA data.Scandinavian Airlines was the most punctual, with aircraft typically taking off just seven minutes behind schedule. Aer Lingus has the second-best record, followed by Air France, Alitalia and Delta Airlines.The average delay across all flights was 15 minutes.A spokeswoman for Wizz Air said: “A number of issues specific to the UK, including airport infrastructure, airspace congestion and slot restrictions contribute to a significantly worse on-time performance of our UK routes compared to the rest of our network.”She said disruption was also caused by “particularly severe winter weather” and that the airline was taking measures to improve its punctuality, such as basing eight aircraft in the UK to reduce its exposure to inbound delays.Norwegian Air Shuttle’s UK flights mainly consist of short-haul services from London Gatwick, Manchester and Edinburgh. Its average delay of 22 minutes does not take into account the majority of the airline’s long-haul flights from UK airports, which are operated by a British subsidiary.A Norwegian spokesman said frequent air traffic control (ATC) strikes across Europe and adverse weather “invariably impact punctuality” and are beyond airlines’ control.“We do everything possible to ensure that flights operate to allow passengers to reach their destination as soon as possible,” he said. “Norwegian is committed to keep improving punctuality, and where factors are within our direct control we have introduced new measures to continue delivering a smooth, efficient experience for our passengers.”The CAA said punctuality “clearly matters to airline passengers” and that it published data on carriers’ performance to allow people to “make informed choices about which airline to fly with”.Dale Keller, the chief executive of airline association BAR UK, said delays were “extremely costly” to carriers, and that airlines are “fully engaged” with governments, ATC providers and airports to minimise causes of disruption outside their control.Passengers on delayed flights from UK airports are entitled to assistance and compensation depending on the cause and length of the disruption. When flights are delayed for more than two hours, airlines have to provide free access to phone calls or emails, meals and refreshments, and hotel accommodation if an overnight stay is required.Passengers can also claim compensation when flights are delayed by more than three hours unless there are “extraordinary circumstances” such as severe weather or a security alert. Payouts range from €250 (£223) to €600 depending on the length of the flight and how long it was delayed.The editor of Which? Travel magazine, Rory Boland, advised delayed passengers to “make sure you make a claim for the compensation that you are entitled to”.“Airlines now need to do the right thing and introduce automatic compensation. Passengers should not have to jump through hoops to claim back the money they are owed,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4440d1e9e1d46e185481b81630fdd5f838eecce4/0_367_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a711941349187697bff2f5bbc262242d","title":"five years ago there was nothing inside duqm the city rising from the sand oman city sand luxury hotels housing","story":"Oman’s sparsely inhabited coast of fishing villages and Bedouin camps is being transformed into industrial city with port, luxury hotels and housing for 111,000by  Wade Shepard in Duqm“Five years ago there was nothing here,” says Hamad Said Al Rawahi as he drives fast along a stretch of freshly paved highway in Oman’s coastal desert. He just picked me up from the side of the road in his shiny black Mercedes. I am hitchhiking – the closest thing to public transport out here.We are in Duqm, a nascent city about 300 miles (480km) from the capital, Muscat, that was a fishing village prior to 2011, when Oman reimagined it, along with a stretch of uninterrupted coastline and Bedouin camps, as a new special economic zone.“It has totally changed,” says Al Rawahi, who has lived in Duqm “for a few years” and works at its dry dock. “Now we have five-star hotels and villas … There are shops and supermarkets, places you can go and visit.”The city is still in its early days. The basic highway grid has just been paved, the port and dry dock have recently begun operating, the oil refinery is getting set to fire up, and two luxury hotels have opened their doors. Within two years an estimated 111,000 people are expected to call this place home.The masterplan for Duqm follows the guidelines of transit-oriented development virtually step by step. A sea port is being used to seed a vast special economic zone, which in turn is being used as an economic driver for the entirely new metropolis. The full gamut of urban offerings will be built in Duqm: industrial zones, a large refinery, a new airport, education centres, sprawling thickets of modern housing and a tourism district. The idea is that the various projects will act in symbiosis: traffic at the port will drive demand for industries in the special economic zone, these industries will create a need for housing for employees and investors, and this new population will want entertainment, shops, schools and healthcare. In theory, at least.The masterplanned nature of Duqm is also intended to allow for a more liberalised economic environment that could spark more private industry, create new types of jobs, and attract foreign investment – while tempting Omanis away from Muscat.Globally, Duqm is no anomaly. We are in the midst of an era of new cities – with more than 200 currently under construction. Remote deserts all over east Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa are being urbanised. There’s Nurkent in Kazakhstan, Aylat in Azerbaijan, New Kabul City in Afghanistan, New Baghdad in Iraq, Rawabi in Palestine, King Abdullah Economic City in Saudi Arabia, New Cairo in Egypt … Morocco has nine new cities in the works, and Kuwait has 12.While differing in scale and complexity, most of these new cities are designed to meet similar goals: to reshape their economies and to rebrand their countries as technologically advanced and economically sustainable, as sleek, modern and international.The International Monetary Fund predicted in 2016 that Oman could be one of a host of oil-dependent Middle Eastern countries that could run out of money before the end of the decade. Coming alongside shocks such as the 2014 oil price crash, the message of ersification was driven home.The government of Oman responded by decreeing that the hydrocarbon-derived share of its GDP will be halved by 2020 . To this end, $106bn (£81bn) was earmarked to develop tourism, transport and real estate sectors – and efforts to bring projects like Duqm to fruition were doubled down.“Several dozen new cities are being constructed in the Middle East, mainly to transition away from the petroleum industry to a variety of other industries, including tourism, manufacturing, education and hi-tech,” says Dr Sarah Moser, a McGill University geography professor and author of an upcoming atlas of new cities. “Many oil-producing states in the Middle East are eager to globalise their economies and attract international investors, particularly in anticipation of a post-oil world. New cities are a way to jumpstart this economic transition, and are also seen as a way to start fresh and avoid the entrenched corruption, bureaucracy and political entanglements of existing cities.”Duqm sits on the Arabian Sea near the Strait of Hormuz, the gateway to the Persian Gulf – and the world’s most glaring oil supply chokepoint. Nearly a fifth of the world’s oil currently flows through this passage, ever prone to disruption. If the Duqm project succeeds, the shipping industry would be able to dock at the gates of the Middle East without needing to go all the way inside.It is this strategic position that has attracted the attention of Beijing’s much heralded Maritime Silk Road. More than three-quarters of Oman’s crude oil exports go directly to China.Last year, Oman Wanfang – a consortium of private Chinese companies – staked a $10.7bn 11 sq km claim in Duqm’s special economic zone. The consortium pragmatically dubbed their section of Duqm the Sino-Oman Industrial City and has plans to build an oil refinery, a methanol plant, a solar power equipment production facility, an automobile factory, a building materials plant, a $200m five-star tourism zone and enough homes to support a population of 25,000 in the area.While the money for this endeavour is not officially coming from the Chinese government, Oman Wanfang clearly has the full political support of Beijing, including approval from the National Development and Reform Commission, which has declared it a “top overseas industrial park”. This high-level political support has greased the path for other Chinese economic adventures in Oman, such as the $3.6bn behemoth of a loan presented to Muscat last year.Other nations have invested in Duqm too, including Kuwait, Japan, Saudi Arabia and South Korea, and in February it was announced that India would be given access to the port and dry dock for commercial and military purposes.While Duqm was never very densely populated, around 3,000 Bedouin – mostly fishermen and semi-nomadic herders – called the area home before the bulldozers arrived.These villages have now been demolished and the Oman government has built a new, modern town for them to relocate to. The houses look as if they were copied and pasted from Muscat – bright, white buildings two storeys high with garages and ornate gateways. There is a mosque in the centre. The houses stand empty. The local Bedouin prefer their traditional way of life – and want space to keep camels.“They don’t want to stay in the accommodation provided by the state because they find it very unnatural,” says Prasad. “But modernity has to catch up with them … whether they like it or not.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a91fbcbf9e6e821c1949009e55778de57ebe753a/103_14_5417_3250/master/5417.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=734a4f0198ecea406336ae56f6c6fb36","title":"ten friends two decades same holiday house it really shouldnt work","story":"I don’t like spending time with people, but to have a bunch of friends willing to stomach weeks of me, playing the same games and having the same arguments is specialAt the table, Andy is making a seven-cheese and meat sandwich that defies belief. In the hallway, Rhik is cracking himself up by wilfully mispronouncing Billie Piper’s name. Billy Pooper. Billy Pooper. Selina enters now, talking loudly about a colleague’s affair, as if she is on the phone, but she is not on the phone. Abandoning his book, a summery hardback about the history of slavery, Amish Tom asks if anyone wants to go for a bike ride. “Apparently, there’s a market town 50km from here.” Kate, who treats any mention of exercise as the punchline to a joke, sprays him with baguette crumbs.Going on holiday with friends is a risk. People have different musical tastes, rise at incompatible hours, follow particular diets they have varying ideas of a good time, reasonable budgets and who it’s OK to bring back to the flat and at which hours. Holidays are when you discover that aspects of people you previously liked are quite grating after five hours. Or that they have unfamiliar sides to their character, leading to the counterintuitive feeling you know them less well than before, and a post-holiday distance emerges while you recalibrate the relationship. It’s hard going on holiday with your mates. Or at least it should be.I have been going on the same holiday, to a house in France, for nearly two decades, with the same 10 people. Advertising encourages us to think of holidays as a chance for discovery and adventure novel experiences with high Instagram traction. Yet my holidays are identical, every time. The height of adventure is a hornet on the upstairs landing. I dimly remember the place being in an attractive patch of countryside, but could be wrong, because I never leave the house when I’m there.It’s inexplicable that I could spend this much time in company. I generally find people a bit much. Couldn’t eat a whole one. An hour is plenty, then a day off for recovery. The only reason this tradition works is that there is no itinerary, and no expectation other than that everyone be their authentic selves, for better or worse. Anti-socialness is accepted, as are unprompted bouts of grappling. The playlists are bananas, though recently we’ve settled on a zonal compromise: Yo La Tengo and Nancy Sinatra in the kitchen, Bruno Mars and Drake by the pool. Kate, a nurse, is free to talk about teratomas in eye-watering detail while serving up artichoke hearts in cheese sauce. Andy can extemporise on the human condition, but if tree surgeon Pete approaches and asks if I want to play ping pong for six hours, I won’t even sign out of the conversation I’ll just stand up and go.I’m one of those excellent people who tends to drop his friends as soon as there’s an outbreak of love in his life. Who will disappear for six months, or three years. This place is always here when I return, as are these people. Our culture is less interested in friendship, assuming romantic and familial stories to be more intense. Yet there’s nothing to equal the warm bath of friendship, particularly this holiday variety. To be truly accepted – even as a perpetually hungover bad loser in card games, with inefficient washing-up technique. To have a group of people know you intimately, historically and decide – without the glue of shared debt or organ compatibility – that they can stomach weeks of you, embroidering the same old stories, having the same old arguments, in the same old shorts? To me, that’s beautiful.This weekend saw the launch of Vans x Van Gogh, a range of skateboard clothing printed with the tortured Dutch artist’s most famous works. I’m on board: primarily for the name. It’s like one of those jokes that occurs to you in conversation, and is so good you can’t help but make it (even if it jeopardises a friendship or upsets your boyfriend). This is the business version, in which the shoe company stumbled on a piece of wordplay so compelling, it couldn’t not make it (a lucrative merchandise opportunity).Some may find this commodification of Van Gogh’s genius banal. Proof of our narcissistic inability to appreciate art, except to enhance our own brand. That’s a good point. However, the collection looks absolutely boss. Sunflowers, Skull and Self Portrait will feature on bomber jackets, backpacks, and sneakers, with the soles replicating Vincent’s characteristic brushstrokes. Personally, I can’t wait for sports-luxe collaborations with other old masters. Pablo Adidasso? Jackson Reeboks? Toulouse-Lacoste? Great art is inextricably bound up with commerce and identity, anyway. The wealthy have always reduced it to a financial asset, or décor or – by commissioning their own portraits – themselves. You can have the Sistine Chapel in your hall, so why not Mona Lisa on a bum bag? It’ll wipe the smirk off her face.OK, maybe it is tragic, but that’s capitalism. It’s a problem that we hold artists to a higher standard than the world they have to survive in. Vincent was a typical millennial snowflake, who died penniless and overwhelmed, his special talent unrecognised by everyone around him. Why has the Van Gogh Museum, dedicated to preserving his legacy, signed up for the youth-appealing fashion range? Must be the Monet!I can’t stop laughing about the Turkish zoo accused of painting a donkey to look like a zebra. Hee-haw. Isn’t this an Only Fools and Horses storyline? Or maybe Scooby-Doo? How did it think it would get away with it? Most zebras aren’t smudged. It’s not even original: the practice originated in Gaza, where they’ve been painting donkeys’ ears for, well, donkey’s years. The best part is that, when quizzed about it, the Turkish zookeepers stickingstuck to their story, like a man with a wonky toupee.

Having woefully failed at 2017’s attempt on Henry James, who fell foul of a sudden addiction to his sleuthier cousin PD, I’m once again preparing to tackle Proust, courtesy of a 50th birthday present of a beautiful boxed set of In Search of Lost Time. Thank God I shan’t be doing it alone, but in the company of novelist Susan Hill, who explained in last week’s Spectator Diary that, having got so far and no further on multiple previous occasions, she too was going back in. She is now on Book 5, and I salute her.Perhaps if we succeed, we can meet up, together with other Marcel completists, and debate the merits of the essay by Perry Anderson that recently featured in the London Review of Books. Anderson argued, at some length, that we should regard Anthony Powell, the author of the 12-volume novel sequence A Dance to the Music of Time, in a kindly light, possibly even kindlier than that we reserve for Proust’s magnum opus.The argument for Powell can be crudely summarised as an argument for the close, but crucially detached, observation of what Anderson called, way back in 1984, “the greatest fictional representation” of “the last true leisure-class in metropolitan history”. Powell’s narrator, Nick Jenkins, goes to a lot of parties Proust’s, not so much. Where Proust wove magical sentences around his alter ego’s profound interiority, Powell abandoned his to the cut and thrust of the elite’s social and political lives. What he was aiming for, wrote Christopher Hitchens in 1998, was “the harnessing of counterpoint” he also quoted VS Pritchett’s description of Powell as “a Proust Englished by Wodehouse”.Pritchett, unsurprisingly, was on to something there: not merely that Powell had a talent for spotting the jocular side to human, class-based interaction, but also that it led him to a particularly fruitful blend of humour and satire. Nobody who has followed the adventures of Kenneth Widmerpool – a humourless, pompous man on the make who goes from Labour MP to member of a cult – could doubt it.But whether you are in #TeamProust or #TeamPowell, it might seem the time is right to question whether these long, fictional trajectories are, themselves, now a part of Lost Time. When the Man Booker prize judges announced their longlist of the 13 novels in contention for this year’s £50,000 prize, much was made of the inclusion of types of book not previously recognised by the award – notably the graphic novel and the thriller, in this case Nick Drnaso’s Sabrina and Belinda Bauer’s Snap respectively. It was a sign, perhaps, that the hegemony of the conventional narrative – a story with a beginning, a middle and an end, told in a roughly recognisable “literary” style – was waning, and that the arbiters of what was good and worthwhile in contemporary fiction were starting to loosen their stays. There was a novel in verse, Robin Robertson’s The Long Take a multi-vocal e into London life, Guy Gunaratne’s In Our Mad and Furious City and a terrifying, gendered dystopia, Sophie Mackintosh’s The Water Cure.And of course, the last three winners of the prize – Marlon James, Paul Beatty and George Saunders – stake a large claim to the idea that traditional narratives are no longer holding sway when it comes to handing out the cheques Saunders’s Lincoln in the Bardo, in which dozens of the newly dead congregate in the afterlife to discuss the fate of Abraham Lincoln’s deceased son, is a masterclass in bewildering, and then beguiling, readers.As culture, politics and social life appear to fracture and atomise, and find representation in short, sharp hits of writing – Olivia Laing’s Crudo, for example, both set and written in seven weeks last summer, or Ali Smith’s against-the-clock quartet of novels – does a place remain for the long sequence, written over many years, filled with recurring characters, looping themes, patterns that emerge only in retrospect?Happily, yes. Take Alan Hollinghust, for example, whose technique of progressing the story in blocks of time, with unchronicled years between them, worked to vivid effect in his most recent novel, The Sparsholt Affair. Others eschew the strict parameters of the series – each novel following on from the previous in obvious chronology – by creating works that bear a strong family resemblance, and which, taken together, seem like attempts on the summit via different routes.Amanda Craig’s novels, Hearts and Minds and The Lie of the Land, take the nation’s pulse with wit and insight, and she is now deep into the next instalment. Jonathan\u0026nbspCoe’s new book, Middle England, will be published this November, a quarter of a century after What a Carve Up! appeared, melding a very British love of comic B-movie culture with a panoramic view of the tyranny and loathsomeness of the ruling classes. This after a series of ambitious assaults on the establishment. His last novel, Number Eleven, managed to combine both the passage of time with painfully acute swipes at the idiocies and venalities of contemporary culture (you might never watch I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here! in quite the same benign light again). So the purveyors of the longue durée are still in business, just over 100 years after the first instalment of In Search of Lost Time. I’ll do my best with Proust this summer. But the best news for\u0026nbsplovers of fiction is that we don’t have to choose\u0026nbspbetween the long view or the short run-up we can have them both.• Alex Clark writes for the  and the Observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8610cdb217ba86a4832a393c428cd0a47e2a36e5/0_2_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d58316156fb9f4561b05debaa72f1706","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of soar","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘soar’The closing date is Wednesday 8 August at 10am.

It’s very much now a collaborative thing.“The world is out there, you can go and see for yourself, very often now for very small amounts of money, what the world looks like, and I think that’s a great opportunity.“I think it broadens the mind. That’s one obvious thing, but also I think it just helps us to understand how other countries are the way they are, and this is really very important in just helping us to realise that we all share the same planet and we should know more about what makes us different as well as what makes us similar.”The increase in geography take-up is likely to have been fuelled by the introduction of the English baccalaureate, a government measure that recognises teenagers who study English, maths, science, history or geography and a language at GCSE.Palin said field trips were very important, and that they were what had first got him interested in the subject.“I looked at books, I looked at maps, I looked at atlases, I enjoyed that, but the thing that inspired me most of all was being taken from the school into the local area to look at nature,” he said. “To look at the way the land looked, to understand the geography, to walk up little hills and streams and see how the ecological system worked, look at the environment.”Getting outdoors was “where the magic appeal of geography lies,” he said. “It’s being out there, it’s being able to see and touch and feel what the land is like”.The writer, broadcaster and former Monty Python star suggested that the rise in the subject’s popularity may be down in part to modern technology, which allows people to talk to others “in Argentina, or Sri Lanka, or Norway all in the same morning”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e892deb7eff5c8604b81246e12651c5e45bb91f/0_230_5038_3023/master/5038.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0ed5a0507acb9f29873195d7c027184","title":"uk economy could benefit from more going to university","story":"Universities UK says educating people of all ages would help to meet economic challengesThe UK economy could benefit from more people of all ages attending university, a report has concluded.It also suggests the advance of automation, robotics, artificial intelligence and digital technology, as well as the challenges of Brexit and an ageing population are creating greater demand for those with qualifications above level 4.These include HNCDs, foundation, undergraduate and postgraduate degrees.The Universities UK report highlights the need for continual upgrading of skills, lifelong learning and study of higher education qualifications at all levels.The report calls on policymakers to help reverse the latter trend and encourage closer links between universities and employers.Alistair Jarvis, the chief executive of Universities UK, said: “The UK economy and society needs more graduates. Educating more people of all ages at university would grow our economy faster, by increasing productivity, competitiveness and innovation.“To meet future challenges, the government should develop new policies to make part-time study more appealing, upskilling easier and encourage lifelong learning among our ageing population.”Edwin Morgan, of the Institute of Directors, said: “A significant factor in the UK’s low productivity growth is that firms aren’t able to fully adopt and embed new technologies in their business models.“In many cases this is because they lack the required skills. The government must view education as an integral part of its industrial strategy.”• In 2016, 440,000 new professional jobs were created, but there were only 316,690 UK-domiciled first-degree graduates to fill them, leaving a recruitment gap more than doublethat of 2015.• By 2030, it is estimated there will be a UK talent deficit of between 600,000 to 1.2 million workers in the financial, business, technology, media and telecommunications sectors.• The number of part-time students in higher and further education, and with alternative providers fell from 539,645 in 2013-14 to 476,910 in 2016-17.A Department for Education spokesman said: “Everyone with the talent and potential should be able to take advantage of our world class universities and it’s fantastic to see a record number of 18-year-olds going to university, including those from disadvantaged backgrounds.“Graduates provide employers with the skills needed for a future economy and a degree can open up a huge range of opportunities, alongside a premium on earnings.“But for those who choose not to go to university, we’re introducing gold-standard T-levels to provide technical education on a par with academic routes, and have driven up the quality of apprenticeships to widen the options for young people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/feeef754e3a6240f1791ee0e9c821ffc2316996e/0_4_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=005e7dd007c02245aba153698ea3c744","title":"new green belt housing applications push total to a record 460000","story":"Developers made proposals for 35,000 homes in protected parts of England in 2017Applications to build an additional 35,000 homes on green belt land were submitted last year, taking the total number proposed for construction on protected land to a record 460,000.New data from the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) released on Monday showed that more than 24,000 homes were constructed in the UK’s green belts in the past nine years. Its State of the Green Belt 2018 report reveals that the number of finished homes constructed on the protected areas almost doubled last year to about 8,000.The government has pledged to protect green belt land but housing campaigners believe much more controlled land could be released to build badly needed affordable new homes.The CRPE data, collated from various sources, came just weeks after the government’s revised national planning policy framework, issued last month after a consultation period in the spring. The new framework, released with a slew of other announcements just before the parliamentary recess, contained a number of crucial policy points.In the new policy, ministers overruled campaigners, parish councils and others who called for a blanket ban on building in the green belt, while also not agreeing to the further relaxation of the green belt rules sought by developers. The government concluded: “The restrictions on the location of housing in the green belt are in place to prevent gradual erosion of green belt boundaries over time and to maintain openness. The revised framework does however continue to make clear that plans may provide for limited affordable housing for local community needs.”The CPRE found that in 2017-18, more than 8,000 homes were built on the green belt, with 4,800 on brownfield sites and 3,300 on previously undeveloped land. That compares with more than 4,000 completions in 2016-17, of which fewer than 1,000 were on greenfield sites.Robert Colvile, the director of the Centre for Policy Studies, said the current system was flawed. “It is bizarre that greater London is surrounded by an area three times larger on which little can be built, irrespective of the quality of the land,” he said. “No one is calling for the green belt to be concreted over. But there is plenty of scope for judicious development, for example around transport hubs, while protecting the most beautiful countryside.”CPRE said the “exceptional circumstances” rules for green belt building should be strengthened to ensure any proposals for development must pass strict tests.The Green party called for a land value tax to encourage the use of vacant land. Currently, thousands of hectares of land that have been approved for homebuilding goes unused as the owners wait for values to increase rather than construct housing. A land value tax would penalise landowners who sit on land for which building permits have been issued.The party’s co-leader Jonathan Bartley said: “Instead of overseeing the erosion of our green space, the government should invest in increasing social and affordable housing on the plentiful brownfield sites in our towns and cities, take action on empty homes, and introduce a land value tax to encourage the use of vacant land and reduce speculation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac5a58e0b52cb250191b6b6ea3e292c889270e59/0_185_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdd20e81fdbd49f752137fb6ddc8684a","title":"flame fades for rohingya families amid mud and monsoons in bangladesh","story":"A million people who fled Myanmar for Kutupalong are struggling to eat after floodwater soaked the firewood they use for cookingStinging eyes and a chest heavy with the smoke that saturates her broken shelter are the constant ailments Feroza Khatun has learned to live with during her first rainy season in a Bangladeshi refugee camp.The acrid smoke hangs in the air as she works, as she sits to read the Qur’an at night and – especially – when she cooks.The problem lies with the firewood she and the million other Rohingya refugees from Myanmar have to use for cooking. Like everything else, in their homes or on their bodies, the firewood has succumbed to the inescapable rainy season. With the wet weather comes uncertainty: where to find food, as well as the threat of floods, landslides and cyclones. “We’ve struggled a lot during this monsoon,” says Khatun, 50, as her husband struggles to fasten fresh tarpaulin to the bamboo frame that forms their home. “When it rains, the water leaks inside and makes the firewood wet. When we try to set a fire, nothing happens. So we throw kerosene on to the firewood and it becomes easier to light. Without kerosene or plastic or paper, it’s very hard to cook.” Even her stove, hand-moulded from mud, has become wet in recent weeks after one side of the shelter was ripped out by heavy winds. Storms have destroyed their dwelling twice since the rains started in June, on each occasion causing damage that has necessitated weeks of repair work by her husband.Makeshift shelters like Khatun’s have mushroomed near the Bangladesh-Myanmar border since last August, when a Myanmar military operation claimed an estimated 6,700 lives and prompted more than 700,000 people to flee across the border.  The majority clustered in the forests around Kutupalong, which has become one of the world’s largest refugee camps. Once an area of thick greenery, Kutupalong has become a sea of plastic tents propped up against each other and hanging from hillsides weakened by the rains. Months of preparation were intended to limit the effects of the monsoon but much of that work has been undone sandbags intended to shore up hills have themselves burst, and fortifications for family shelters have largely failed to prevent them flooding.Providing food has been a challenge since the latest and largest wave of Rohingya refugees arrived in Bangladesh. Aside from having to hunt for fuel, many struggle with the lack of variety in their ration. But the increasing difficulty of simply cooking those basic supplies has added to their vulnerability.Some, like Khatun’s family, try to set aside extra rice for their next meal whenever they are able to cook. They are often the families who use kerosene to ignite the fire, despite the dangerous smoke it produces. Others simply make do with weak flames that take hours to even partially cook rice. The issues are worse for families whose homes have not only been damaged by winds but completely inundated by floodwater, rendering firewood useless and causing rice and lentil supplies to rot. “There’s nothing I can do about it, unless I hang the bags from the roof,” says Sharmin Akhter, two days after returning to her shelter following flooding earlier in July.“It was raining heavily and there were strong winds, like a mini-cyclone,” she recalls. “It rained much longer than usual, so the stream below flowed into the house. We were asleep – we didn’t realise until the water came inside.”For more than two weeks, Akhter had to rely on relatives to provide her family with shelter and food until her home was repaired. In several areas of the camps, Rohingya said they had often had to ask neighbours for food or request help from local camp leaders, known as Majhis, some of whom were coordinating families under their watch to ensure everyone was fed. Families without those options say they simply had to go without. The World Food Programme (WFP) says that over the past week it has had to provide more than 1,560 people with prepared hot meals and 700 households with additional food aid, mostly in the form of high-energy biscuits. Wet firewood also poses health risks for the refugees, says Peter Agnew, the emergency coordinator in Bangladesh for the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, especially since wholesale deforestation in the area means the wood they do collect is very young.  “It’s green and it still has leaves on it,” says Agnew. “You cook with that stuff in your house and it immediately fills packed full of smoke. “Did you see any of the kids with the green stuff running out of their eyes? It’s really common, it’s eye infections. They hang out with their mother while they’re cooking and they get gunked-up infections in their eyes.” Breathing problems have also increased. The World Health Organization’s weekly health reports showed a consistent rise in the number of patients for Acute Respiratory Infections to more than 10,000 per week during July. The Rohingyas’ struggle to survive using firewood has not surprised the humanitarian community, which had already identified a need for sustainable fuel supplies in crisis situations.  A programme called Safe Access to Fuel and Energyhas been specifically developed to counter the use of wood for fuel, but the size and scale of the Rohingya crisis has proved challenging. “The rapid onset of this particular response, and the sheer scale of the challenge, made planning for cooking fuel challenging in the initial period, especially with such pressing and large-scale humanitarian needs,” says Shelley Thakral, Cox’s Bazar spokesperson for the WFP. Almost a year has passed since the Rohingya influx, but the majority are still relying on firewood. Aid workers blame technical problems such as deciding what fuel to use, and the fire risk associated with using gas.

At this time of year, sunscreen is a prime offender. Sunscreens contain components – such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide – that block UV rays or chemicals – benzophenone, for example – that reduce the harmful effects of UV. You can be allergic to either type, but benzophenone allergy is more common. The clue is in the timing and distribution if you come up in an itchy rash in areas where you apply the most cream, then stop using it, take an antihistamine and try other methods of protection against sun damage. Once the rash calms down, try a sunscreen designed for babies they tend to be the most hypoallergenic.Itchy skin can be part of a generalised allergic reaction and prescribed, herbal or over-the-counter medicines are a common cause. The rash will be itchy, red and look blotchy or like raised hives. It can start up to several weeks after beginning a new drug, gets better when you stop the drug and flares up again (often worse) if you restart. Any drug can cause an allergic reaction – even if you have taken it before with impunity. Antihistamines (eg cetirizine), steroid creams and moisturisers may help, but there’s no substitute for identifying the likely culprit and stopping it, with medical advice.A food allergy can cause a raised, itchy rash (hives). You may get an itchy sensation in the mouth, swelling of lips and roof of mouth, may feel or be sick and then come out in a rash. Mild food allergies may just cause a rash, though you usually get at least a bit of lip tingling as you eat the offending food. Hairy fruits such as kiwi are a common allergen. Allergic reactions often get worse with repeated exposure, but if it’s a food that you don’t eat often, it can be hard to identify it. Allergy testing is available but it helps if you have some idea about likely triggers. Take an antihistamine as soon as possible. A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) is rare but potentially life-threatening anyone who has difficulty breathing or tightening of the throat associated with an allergic reaction should see a doctor and consider carrying adrenaline at all times.Some drugs make the skin particularly sensitive to the effects of sunlight or other sources of ultraviolet light (photosensitivity). These drugs include tetracyclines prescribed for acne, chlorothiazide for high blood pressure and some artificial sweeteners. You don’t get the rash when you first take the drug but it appears when you go out in the sun. It can look like sunburn or an allergic rash. Photosensitivity is also a hallmark of some medical conditions lupus is a long-term condition that affects many systems of the body and can cause red patches and spots on sun-exposed skin. Polymorphous light eruption causes an itchy rash on sun exposure, which tends to get better the longer you’re exposed to UV.Prickly heat causes an itchy rash when you overheat. It doesn’t usually affect the head, neck or limbs and is more common in places where clothing rubs (tight waistbands or under sandal straps). The trick is to remove the friction, cool down the skin and take an antihistamine if the itch is driving you mad. Fungal skin infections can gain hold in damp, hot crevices, ie under the breasts and in the groin area. It’s more common if you have diabetes. The rash is red, often circular, itchy and may have a musty smell. Keep such areas cool and dry, don’t overwash (water gets rid of “good” skin bacteria that help to keep fungus at bay) and try an antifungal cream such as Canesten. Best to see your GP if that doesn’t do the trick.Itchy rashes on the arms or legs alone are often caused by contact with grasses, nettles or other irritant plants (contact dermatitis). Enthusiastic gardeners, hikers, golfers and kids rolling down grassy hills may all notice a rash in exposed parts of the skin that calms down without treatment. You don’t have to be allergic to come up in a rash some plants are irritants to everyone.Eczema can flare up in the heat staying cool, natural fibres, extra moisturisers and antihistamines may help. Psoriasis often improves in the sun because the UV rays are beneficial, but being too hot can cause a prickly heat rash and make existing plaques (thickened skin) itch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/604ad61332ee65d3e71133edb0c19babc8d1b298/0_73_1732_1039/master/1732.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f60de76ef032bd89e591f3b5996cc427","title":"the plays the thing five fabulous audio dramas not to miss this summer","story":"With audio content exploding in popularity, a raft of gripping stories told by multiple narrators is just a few clicks awayA conversation can speak volumes and in the world of audio dramas, they often do. The audio drama – a piece of fiction told using several voices – is in the midst of a renaissance. Previously consigned to rare radio slots on rainy Sundays, audio dramas are now ubiquitous, buoyed by audience tastes for podcasts, and attracting some of the world’s most exciting writers and actors.These are professional, high-quality productions – think Netflix for your ears. And like Netflix, Audible has begun commissioning original audio dramas, making them free for members, putting an end to the bottleneck in which many creatives vie for one radio slot (and a broadcaster therefore has to pick the one with broadest appeal). Audio dramas run the gamut, whether you want a tear-jerking tragedy, an edge-of-your-seat thriller, or a heart-fluttering romance. With such variety, they make for perfect accompaniments to your summer holidays, whether you’ve got a long-haul backpacking trip planned, or a short and swift city break lined up.But with so many options, where do you begin?We picked out five of the best audio dramas from Audible, so you don’t have to. All you have to worry about is whether or not you can resist binge-listening your weekend away.The Child “My name is Simon. I’m 10 years old. I’m a serial killer.” So begins Sebastian Fitzek’s chilling tale of a boy who claims to have killed in a previous life. Set in Berlin, the story follows the child and the only people who believe his cryptic utterings – his mother and a lawyer she has hired. But when Simon’s knowledge leads to several bodies being discovered, the police start to suspect the lawyer. He must solve the crimes before the police put him in the frame, no matter what it takes. Fitzek is one of Germany’s most lauded crime-thriller writers and has seen his work translated into 20 languages. His talents are at their height in this intricate, spine-tingling adaptation. The fabulous narrators include Emilia Fox (Polanski’s The Pianist) and Rupert Penry-Jones (Spooks).Northanger Abbey If audio dramas are having a renaissance, Northanger Abbey might be the Sistine Chapel. A slick, star-studded adaptation of Jane Austen’s classic, this ambitious production has redefined audio storytelling – which is to be expected, given the cast. National treasure and Bafta award-winning actress Emma Thompson tops the bill, bringing Austen’s dry wit to life, while supporting performances from Lily Cole and Jeremy Irvine elevate the series to GOAT (greatest of all time) level. This coming-of-age story follows 17-year-old Catherine Morland through love, danger and intrigue, satirising the gothic tales that were popular at the time of writing, while taking a shrewd look at the British class system. Such skewering of high society feels as fresh as ever. Even those put off by historical drama will find joy in this.Neverwhere Nobody anticipated the impact the BBC’s 2013 adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s cult novel by the same name would have. Broadcast over six days, the production was a smash hit with Gaiman fans and non-fans alike, propelling the audio play into the public eye and showing just how exciting the form can be. Download to listen to Benedict Cumberbatch, David Harewood, James McAvoy and Natalie Dormer telling the story of Richard Mayhew, the unassuming Londoner who finds himself in London Below, a magical version of – and coexisting with – the real city, known as London Above. Originally conceived as a television series, Neverwhere lends itself to episodes, and so its separation into six parts feels natural and seamless. And on Audible it includes over 25 minutes of additional unbroadcasted material, including extended scenes, bloopers and outtakes.Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book: The Mowgli Stories One for the slightly older kids (and also the parents), The Mowgli Stories brings together all of Kipling’s tales about the boy raised by animals in the jungle. Though the average listener might think they know all there is to know about Mowgli from the much-loved Disney film, his adventure takes many more twists and turns. This retelling of the timeless classic stays true to Kipling’s darker side and the well-known cast, including comedian Bill Bailey and actors Richard E Grant and Celia Imrie, make this one unforgettable audio drama. A must-listen for anyone who has seen the film, and a brilliant, truthful, introduction to the work of Kipling for those who haven’t.Locke \u0026amp Key One of Audible’s first forays into commissioning original audio dramas is still among the most ambitious undertakings the form has seen. Locke \u0026amp Key began life as a graphic novel – so translating the form from highly visual to solely audio was no small feat. To do so, Audible drafted in Locke \u0026amp Key’s creators, Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez, to ensure the adaptation stayed true to its dark, terrifying roots. And it worked, assisted no doubt by the voice of scream queen Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) and Haley Joel Osment of “I see dead people” fame. Locke \u0026amp Key follows a family who, starting over after a tragedy, set themselves up in a quiet town that is also frequented by demons. A sharp production that will have you jumping out of your skin and sleeping with one eye open.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible - £7.99 a month after 30 days.

The average price of a pint of beer in London is now £5.20 and regularly tops £6. Across the country, the average is about £3.50, leading to many drinkers staying at home with cans of beer bought in supermarkets instead, said Camra, which warned that more than a dozen pubs a week were closing as a result.Prices have risen steeply in recent years, with various taxes including beer duty, business rates and VAT accounting for a third of the cost, said Camra. The most expensive places for a pint outside London are Oxford (£4.57), Edinburgh and Bristol (£4.35), and Brighton (£4.24). The cheapest is Carlisle £2.35, which is two-thirds of the UK average. Craft beer in supermarkets costs about £1.50 per bottle or can (330ml) and while mass-produced lager and bitters averages less than £1.Camra is concerned that the government is planning to increase the tax paid by pubs in the November budget. Beer duty is to rise by about 2p per pint under Treasury plans, and small pubs are to lose the £1,000 in business rate relief introduced in 2017, but scheduled to end in 2019.The campaign group warned in May about the scale of pub closures, predominately in the south-east. The industry has campaigned for a VAT reduction to allow it to compete with retailers. Chains such as Wetherspoons have bucked this trend by using significant buying power to keep customer prices low. For tied and small independent pubs, that is not an option, say campaigners.Camra’s national chairman, Jackie Parker, said: “It’s no surprise that most people are finding pub pints unaffordable, given the tax burden they’re facing. Beer drinkers will naturally look to more cost-effective ways to enjoy a drink, such as buying from off-licences and supermarkets for home consumption.“The result is incredibly detrimental to our local communities and to our own personal connectivity. Having a good local makes people happier, better-connected and more trusting. Furthermore, pubs help bring communities together and support the local economy. The reality is that there are very few places that can replicate the benefit provided by our nation’s pubs, and once they’re gone, they’re gone for ever.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/024ba9f320d0e98319f95a75df9535565c717431/0_319_4785_2871/master/4785.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=422a16da4699647521493abc43c53b92","title":"less clear on milk payments","story":"Milk \u0026amp More handed my ‘debt’ to collectors even though I didn’t owe them anythingI have used the milk delivery service Milk \u0026amp More for nine years but when they switched to a new system they set me up as an online and offline customer.

I phoned Milk \u0026amp More several times to say there was an error and each time was told it was sorted. Now I have been told my account is with a debt collector. This has been going on for three months, and they don’t seem to communicate with the milkman.

They still owe me money but I just want the harassment to stop.Yet another complaint about Milk \u0026amp More, whose woes we have chronicled extensively here. The company was bought by dairy giant Müller from Dairy Crest in 2015 and has a national workforce of 1,100 delivering more than 100m pints of milk in glass bottles a year.Concern about plastic waste has led to a surge in customers and a new website, involving the migration of 150,000 online customers, has piled on the pressure.We contacted the company, which put its hands up and said in a statement: “We would like to extend our sincere apologies to MP for the mistakes that have been made with her invoices and can confirm that there is no outstanding monies owed on her account.“We have spoken and written to the customer to apologise and explain the cause of the problem. Our investigation has shown that due to an unforeseen technical error, a duplicate account had been created and that showed that there was money owed on the account, when there wasn’t.“We are very sorry for all the inconvenience and recognise that this situation should never have arisen and have taken steps to ensure that it doesn’t happen again.” We urge the company to sort out these technical glitches before it loses even more customers.Email your suggestions to money@the or write to us at Money, , Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Ministers, however, have been growing increasingly anxious that Brussels’ determination to stick to its red lines despite a round of intense British diplomacy in recent days – including May cutting short her holiday to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron – could spell trouble ahead.Fox put the chances of a no-deal Brexit at “60-40” on Sunday despite both sides saying they wanted to reach an agreement on the terms of the UK’s departure from the bloc in March 2019.He blamed the intransigence of the Brussels machine for the increasing risk of no deal. “It’s up to the EU27 to determine whether they want the EU commission’s ideological purity to be maintained at the expense of their real economies,” he said.His comments came just two days after the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said the chances of a no-deal Brexit were “uncomfortably high” and that the financial system was preparing for the potential shock.The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, also said the Brexit process was “heading for no deal by accident”, stepping up his warnings about a potential collapse in talks. “This is not project fear, this is project reality,” he said.“There is an awakening in Europe of the damage to them of no deal and that most member states have no plans for it, so it is rising up their agenda. Clearly talking about it is very difficult to do without spooking people.” The next round of negotiations between the UK and European commission is scheduled for 10 days’ time. Business groups, meanwhile, said ministers had not given them enough time to prepare for no deal. Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “Government needs to show that it’s doing everything within the UK’s control so that businesses know what they would need to deal with on day one.“There’s a real disappointment among businesses that not enough time and preparation has been spent on what happens in the unwelcome event that there is no deal. If I was sitting in the cabinet office right now, one of my number one concerns would be, how do I give businesses every certainty and security?“That needs to be much higher in people’s minds because of course people’s livelihoods and the state of the wider economy does depend on having that information.”His comments came as the plane-maker Bombardier said that stockpiling parts to mitigate the impact of a no-deal Brexit would cost its Belfast business up to £30m. Michael Ryan, the head of the firm’s Northern Ireland operation, said spending such a sum to store goods is “not how we can afford to run a business” and is “cash that I don’t have”. There are fears that the movement of goods could be disrupted by long queues at ports if the UK is unable to reach an agreement with the EU. The Belfast plant operates a “just in time” supply policy to avoid the expense of stocking excess materials.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, tweeted: “No deal would be a catastrophic failure of government, which no government should survive. The cause: PM’s reckless red lines, Tory isions \u0026amp fantasy Brexiteer promises. Parliament has a duty to prevent it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceb15721fdf0e66c7917db2830bf038908f2fb96/0_1191_2279_1367/master/2279.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebace7e01dd93d29f02f0cbdd84906bd","title":"universal credit flaws leaving families debt child poverty action group","story":"Low-income working families are losing hundreds of pounds each year – and being wrongly denied free healthcare entitlements – because of flaws in the way universal credit is designed, campaigners say.The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG ) said arbitrary rules built in to the way universal credit is calculated leave some families unable to predict how much they will be paid each month, leaving households in debt and unable to budget.It can lead to claimants being wrongly benefit-capped – a penalty designed to “incentivise” jobless or low-earning households by severely limiting their benefits – because the system fails to spot they are working and earning enough.Universal credit (UC) is the supposed flagship reform of the benefits system, rolling together six benefits (including unemployment and benefits, and tax credits) into one, online-only system. The theoretical aim, for which there was general support across the political spectrum, was to simplify the system and increase the incentives for people to move off benefits into work.The project was legislated for in 2011 under the auspices of its most vocal champion, Iain Duncan Smith. The plan was to roll it out by 2017. However, a series of\u0026nbspmanagement failures, expensive\u0026nbspIT blunders and design faults\u0026nbsp means it is six years behind schedule and rollout will not be complete until 2023.The original design set out\u0026nbsp a\u0026nbspminimum 42-day wait for a first payment\u0026nbspto claimants when they moved to UC (in practice this is often up to 60 days). After sustained pressure, the government announced in the autumn 2017 budget that the wait would be reduced to 35 days from February 2018. This will partially mitigate the impact on many claimants of having no income for six weeks. The wait has led to\u0026nbsprent arrears and evictions, hunger (food banks in UC areas report\u0026nbspnotable increases in referrals), use of expensive credit and mental distress.\u0026nbspMinisters have expanded the availability of hardship loans (now repayable over a year) to help new claimants while they wait for payment. Housing benefit will now continue for an extra two weeks after the start of a UC claim. However, critics say the five-week wait is still too long and want it reduced to two or three weeks.Plenty.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMultibillion-pound cuts to work allowances\u0026nbspimposed by the former chancellor George Osborne mean UC is far less generous than originally envisaged. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, about 2.5m low-income working households will be more than £1,000 a year worse off when they move to UC, reducing work incentives. Landlords are worried that the level of rent arrears accrued by tenants on UC could lead to a rise in evictions. It\u0027s also not very user-friendly: claimants complain the system is complex, unreliable and difficult to manage, particularly if you have no internet access. And there is concern that UC cannot deliver key promises: a critical study found it does not deliver savings, cannot prove it gets more people into work, and has plunged vulnerable claimants into hardship.In other instances, the problem means claimants doing the same job and earning identical salaries can end up being paid different amounts of universal credit simply because their respective claims begin on different days of the month.The complication, which occurs when pay dates fall close to the start of universal credit assessment periods, can result in claimants who are parents or disabled losing up to £258 of work allowance each month, CPAG has estimated.The charity has called for universal credit to be halted in order to fix the problem before the benefit is extended to over two million people – including many families who are currently in receipt of working tax credits – from July 2019.It says erratic payments have left families stressed and in hardship: “Claimants are often left flummoxed by how much – or how little – universal credit they will receive from one month to the next,” said the CPAG chief executive, Alison Garnham. The problem typically affects claimants whose wages are paid on or close to the first day of their universal credit monthly assessment period, which is used to calculate how much a claimant is entitled to be paid each month.If a claimant is paid wages a day or two earlier – because their normal payday would fall on a weekend or bank holiday, for example – the system records them as having had two pay cheques in one assessment period and none in the following one.As a result, universal credit considers them to be earning more than they actually do in the first period, so automatically blocks “passported” entitlements such as free prescriptions – and in the second period considers them to be earning nothing, so makes them subject to benefit-cap penalties.Claimants whose assessment period start date and payday are at the end of a month are especially prone to losing out, as this is when most bank holidays fall, says CPAG. A worker paid on the last day of each month in 2018 could expect three assessment periods with two paydays and three with no paydays.It cites the case of a working couple with two children who since claiming universal credit last year have seen monthly payments fluctuate from between £1,185 to zero because of pay date and assessment period clashes. They have found it impossible to budget and are now in rent arrears for the first time in their lives.“In reality, the current monthly assessment system is a huge oversimplification which does not reflect the reality of people’s lives and work,” says CPAG.Although claimants often ask the Department for Works and Pensions (DWP) to change their assessment period dates to eliminate the problem, they are routinely told that nothing can be done – in one case a claimant was told that this was simply “the nature of the beast”.The DWP has been much criticised for failing to act on evidence of problems in the benefit system, although last month the work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, promised the DWP will be more responsive when glitches in universal credit were identified.CPAG said campaigners had warned the government about flaws in the monthly assessment period and payment cycle back in 2012 when universal credit was at the design stage but were ignored."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3f643b1a5d514264d96489260707836db8d037b/74_42_2800_1679/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d23b1d2e7b27d880e4d3c4e12e048e3","title":"athletics dina asher smith european championships","story":"• Sprinter is fastest woman in Europe at 100m this year• British team hope to surpass best medal haulDina Asher-Smith has spent most of the past few years studying for a degree in history. Now she intends to make it. The 22-year-old is targeting three gold medals in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m at the European Athletics Championships in Berlin this week as she spearheads a British team hoping to surpass their best haul of 23 medals set in Zurich four years ago.No woman has achieved the European treble since the East German Katrin Krabbe 28 years ago. Asher‑Smith, though, clearly fancies her chances. “This whole season has been about reorganising where I am in the world lists and pushing myself up to be in a position for those podiums, to be challenging for those medals and ultimately be more of a contender,” she said. “And I feel that the Europeans is the place to do it.”Asher‑Smith is already setting her sights higher, though, towards the world championships next year and beyond. “It would be very nice to win. But ultimately it’s not a world or Olympic title. Right now it has importance and it is a stepping stone on to bigger things. But when it comes down to it, it’s all about Tokyo.”Asher-Smith’s confidence is not misplaced. She is the fastest European woman this year over 100m and 200m, including a British record of 10.92sec in the 100m, while Britain’s women are piping hot favourites for the 4x100m relay too. It helps that her major rival, the Netherlands’ Dafne Schippers, the reigning world 200m champion, has struggled to hit her highest notes in 2018.In the past the Dutch runner has often had the edge over Asher-Smith but the Briton feels her performances this year give her the advantage against her friend and long-time rival. “Every single person when you step on the line is beatable,” she says. “Everybody makes mistakes. Some people might have the edge now and again but there’s absolutely nobody that’s unbeatable.”Schippers, who has won at least one gold medal a year at major competitions since switching from heptathlon to sprinting in 2014, had strong words for her critics during a press conference to promote these championships. “You can give me time instead of throwing all negative shit over me,” she said. “The more difficult the situation, the better I’m focused. But sometimes it seems everything less than the first place is not good enough. At the moment it feels like parts are going well but the combination is not there yet. I’m sure it can come together.”When the women’s 100m starts on Monday evening, Asher-Smith and her teammate Imani-Lara Lansiquot will be able to put their feet up having got a bye into Tuesday’s semi-finals by virtue of being among the 12 fastest European women this year. Daryll Neita, however, will have to compete in the heats.Six other Britons are also in action on the first day in Berlin, including Dai Greene and Seb Rodger in the 400m hurdles heats, Chris Bennett and Nick Miller in men’s hammer qualifying, and Dan Bramble and Feron Sayers in men’s long jump qualifying.British Athletics has a squad of 102 athletes in Berlin, the biggest team sent to a major championships in the modern era, and is expecting a large haul of medals with Lorraine Ugen, Zharnel Hughes, Asher-Smith, Matthew Hudson-Smith and Laura Muir all ranked number one in Europe at their events.The medal haul is likely to begin on Tuesday, with strong hopes in the men’s and women’s 100m and the men’s hammer. There is even the chance of a British 1-2-3 in the men’s 100m final on Tuesday night with Hughes, Reece Prescod and CJ Ujah all fancying their chances and the Frenchman Jimmy Vicaut having injury concerns.“Anything is possible,” said Ujah, who won the Diamond League 100m title last year. “There are a lot of competitors going for a gold medal but, if we do get a 1-2-3, it will be a historic moment.”The British team will be captained by Greene, the world champion 400m hurdler, who returns to the squad for the first time since 2013 after a series of injuries.“I’m looking forward to having that sensation which brings out the best of me and my competitive side.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb13f4d7b2c3f96ba14a069fb5391f590386a002/79_58_2639_1584/master/2639.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97af4b87d5cd5dafb0c65eefca0bd8af","title":"trevor bayliss england ben stokes india second test","story":"Trevor Bayliss, the England head coach, has called on his players to “pick up the slack” at Lord’s this week as Ben Stokes, one of their match-winners from the thrilling first Test with India, misses the game to attend his trial in Bristol.Stokes is due in court on Monday after he and co-defendants Ryan Ali and Ryan Hale pleaded not guilty to a charge of affray in relation to an alleged incident in the Clifton area of the city last September. When he returns to international duty will depend on the Cricket Discipline Committee, which is due to convene after the conclusion of legal\u0026nbspproceedings.In the meantime, and with the second Test against Virat Kohli’s India team starting on Thursday, Joe Root’s side must perform without their talismanic all-rounder, whose demeanour during the series opener at Edgbaston was described as “golden” by Bayliss after his three wickets on the final morning sealed the 31-run win.Bayliss also played down fears that such a high-profile case running in parallel to a Test could prove a distraction to his players, and he pointed to the absence of Stokes during the winter Ashes series as guiding this view.“I’ve got no concerns about it,” Bayliss said. “Ben has no concerns about it as well. Obviously, it’s something we would have liked to have not been happening. That was the same in Australia. But the boys just got on with it. There was a bit of chat before the series but once we got there it was about playing as well as we can.”Looking ahead to the Lord’s Test, Bayliss said his players were “under no illusions” about needing to work on their batting and catching – four chances went down at Edgbaston, albeit with the now-discarded Malan responsible for three of them – but the head coach was encouraged by a bowling performance that exposed some Indian frailties against the Dukes\u0026nbspball. One man reprieved by England’s profligacy was Kohli, who en\u0026nbsproute to a masterful 149 in India’s first innings was put down by Malan on 21 and 51. With exactly 200 runs across the Test – nearly half his side’s output – the right‑hander has now usurped Steve Smith, the suspended former Australia captain, as the world’s No\u0026nbsp1 Test batsman.As a result, Bayliss is keen for his bowlers to keep the remainder of the Indian batting order down at Lord’s and thus heighten the expectations on Kohli. England’s lineup, though, could be viewed as having similar deficiencies and not least against spin, with Ravi Ashwin fresh from seven wickets including Alastair Cook bowled twice.Bayliss said: “We’ve got a few guys who are not cemented in the team and that puts extra pressure on people like Root, Jonny Bairstow and those guys to make the big scores. I don’t think it’ll be any different for India. The way Kohli played was high-class stuff. If we can put pressure on the others, that’s going to add to the pressure on him.“When the ball’s moving, we’ve shown that a few of their guys do struggle. I’m sure that they’ll be going away working out how they can play it, as we’re working on how to play the off-spin.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d04041a95d65f1f9bd56f08a49f9f2a5079d9d16/0_160_5360_3216/master/5360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2887aa18ddb0b75d98a65ab98491e24","title":"le mow the 12 hour lawnmower race in pictures","story":"Teams compete all night in an endurance race in West Sussex in the cheapest form of motorsport"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f39a90c615362017dde4c599fa48963951eab237/0_1028_3968_2381/master/3968.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=538c0df0a0eda31b278014fb03b4a445","title":"emma sidi you can only fully write a character if you can love them","story":"The character comic switches roles like a regenerating Time Lord in her new Edinburgh show, Faces of Grace – from a wannable Love Island contestant to a cat-loving lonerMany comedians destined for Edinburgh each August put in a solid 10 or 11 months of workshopping beforehand. Sidi knows the drill, having taken two acclaimed sets to the fringe. Character Breakdown, in 2015, saw her play six different roles, including a feminism professor whose lecture, delivered entirely in Spanish, was prone to stray from the topic. At one point, she relates the tale of being interrupted by Dobby the House Elf during some “solo masturbación.” Sidi’s 2016 show, Telenovela, ended with the audience building giant foil wings for her to fly away. By the time we meet in spring, I have seen her perform another work-in-progress hour in the basement of a pub – minus the NHS dance. “It’s good to get your weirdest ideas out there as early as you can,” says Sidi, who records every show to identify what works. “But that one didn’t offer enough character development.” Also for the chop is a device that invited the audience to determine the running order of the sketches by cheering for different costumes laid out on the stage. “God, you really are seeing the rough bits,” she laughs. “I liked the idea of having a different finale each night, but you think: ‘Wouldn’t it be nice just to have a show that’s as funny as possible?’”The pub gig ends with a line that seems to refer to work-in-progress shows in general (“Fuck it, that’ll do!”) but which Sidi knows will have to change. Already impressive is her monologue as Britta, an irrepressibly upbeat, denim-clad pan-European whose only friend is her cat. “I’ve been doing Britta since university. She’s the closest to me and I know her vocabulary inside out. If she wants to tell you that she’s been thinking about something, she’ll say, ‘I’ve been ’avin’ a scribble in ma noggin.’” Should Sidi get to be a star of Steve Coogan proportions, Britta is the likeliest candidate to become a more adorable equivalent of Alan Partridge: the Greatest Hit. The new show, which has acquired the title Faces of Grace, offers other contenders. There’s a know-it-all American fresh from a bizarre blind date and a tearful wannabe Love Island contestant. There is also an aspiring nurse with a clench-jawed Katherine Hepburn drawl. “She started out as Australian but I couldn’t nail the accent. I’m trying to make her almost totally abstract. I like not knowing what the point of her is. I don’t want to give up on her yet.”A month later, in an overheated theatre above another pub, the nurse has survived, pushed even further into the realm of the bizarre, though her musings on the celebrity coupling of Elon Musk and the singer Grimes (“Grusk”) have been cut. “It was too niche.” A highly strung “contemporary kinetic-movement practitioner” ties the show together. “I’ve been to classes and had teachers like her. They get you to put on a bin bag and crawl around like a crab, then they say: ‘OK, what kinetic possibilities did we get out of that?’ There have been times when I was going along just to generate material.” Evident in all five characters is Sidi’s affection for them and their aspirations. “I feel you can only fully write a person if you can love them. The ones here are all searching for grace, for transcendent beauty. They want to rise above their lowly position in the world.”Our final meeting takes place at the Streatham Space Project in mid-July. Sidi has just performed her penultimate work in progress before Edinburgh, and it is the tightest and funniest yet. The jokes are pretty much intact, save for the odd alteration: a bowtie in one gag has become a cravat, while a Megabus reference has arrived tardily, much like a Megabus itself. But with the help of the director Oliver Dawe, Faces of Grace has graduated into a fluid and theatrical piece with bold transitions.

But Harry Baker and Chris Read have made waves over the last year (Radio 2 appearances guest slots on Russell Howard’s Sky show) with their brand of peppy comic song, and, provided you put Conchords comparisons to the back of your mind, their latest fringe offering makes for a pleasantly erting hour. There’s no edge whatsoever to what they do, and at points the show shades into blandness. It’s not clear what distinctive new qualities they bring to the musical comedy party. Their songs range frictionlessly across subjects from the romantic lives of pandas to the woes of supporting the England football team. When they do address something contentious – the spectre of terrorism in their final song, for example – they reap platitudes (“Fear only has the power we give it,” runs their wholesome refrain).Read’s music, while doing all it needs to do, isn’t the sell here. The songs put Baker’s wordplay front and centre he’s a former World Poetry Slam champ. One number consists entirely of ice-cream puns. Another fuses Beyoncé’s Crazy in Love with the Teletubbies (“Sun’s got the face of a baby right now”). Some lyrics are improvised, competently if unexceptionally, to audience suggestions. It’s all well worked, the wordplay is adept, and the pair have a likable manner. I wished for more personality, something to set them apart from other mild-mannered purveyors of jaunty comic song.

This grey-clad trio of post-industrial goddesses preside over a rusty vat and a screen hung with what look like curtain tassels. It soon becomes apparent, via the dancers’ dextrous manipulation of thread and a massive pair of knitting needles, that these anonymous bunches of yarn represent inidual human lives, each one created and ritually disposed of by the Fates. Limosani’s choreography, which she performs herself along with the excellent Tara Jade Samaya and Kialea-Nadine Williams, is full of intricate linear textures. Arms entwine and unfold through kaleidoscopic patterns of muscular geometry. Sometimes the trio are overtaken by insectoid flutters or unheimlich judders and undulations. A beat later, they’ve formed an angular tripartite machine, strands running between their toes with mechanistic precision. It is quietly stunning.The Fates’ labour – in both senses of the word – is articulated effectively. Thread emerges from Limosani’s mouth as if churned from the gut, pulled out into the world by her sisters. The resultant bundles are treated with a mixture of cradling reverence, scorn and possessiveness. But spinning out destiny also comprises dull routine, while the prospect of going renegade and exerting choice holds momentous dramatic allure. Nigel Levings’ gloomy green-tinged lighting enhances the uncanny atmosphere, while Guy Veale’s strange electronic soundscape mixes bassline thumps with the insistent bleeps of some mythic morse code. Intelligent, captivating and superbly performed.

It is quite simply wrong for Beijing’s Communist foreign ministry to get involved with an issue which should be determined within Hong Kong.”City leader Carrie Lam, appointed by a pro-Beijing committee, on Sunday expressed “regret” at the planned event and noted that the historic club building is government-owned.The club has said Chan’s talk on 14 August will still go ahead.It is part of a “club lunch” tradition which has seen an array of speakers, including Chinese officials, address members and the media.Activists calling for independence from Hong Kong emerged from the failure of the mass pro-democracy Umbrella Movement rallies of 2014 to win political reform. Any talk of a split has become a red flag for Beijing, which has ramped up rhetoric against threats to its territorial integrity under President Xi Jinping.Hong Kong police last month sought to ban Chan’s party – which promotes the city’s independence from China but only has a core membership of around a dozen people – citing it as a national security threat.Hong Kong’s security chief had said he was considering the police request while the party was given a few weeks to make representations.Pro-independence campaigners and politicians calling for self-determination for Hong Kong have been banned from standing for office and disqualified from the legislature.The city’s best-known independence advocate Edward Leung was jailed for six years in June on rioting charges after clashes with police in 2016.

The statement came after the Canadian foreign ministry and the Canadian embassy urged the Saudi authorities to “immediately release” civil rights activists.“We urge the Saudi authorities to immediately release them and all other peaceful \u001dhuman rights activists,” the Canadian embassy tweeted on Friday. Canadian foreign ministry officials were not available for an immediate comment on Sunday. Last Wednesday, Human Rights Watch said Saudi Arabia had arrested women’s rights activists Samar Badawi and Nassima al-Sadah, the latest two to be swept up in a government crackdown on activists, clerics and journalists. More than a dozen women’s rights activists have been targeted since May. On Friday, Canada said it was “gravely concerned” about the arrests of civil society and women’s rights activists in Saudi Arabia, including Badawi, the sister of jailed dissident blogger Raif Badawi. “We urge the Saudi authorities to immediately release them and all other peaceful human rights activists,” Global Affairs Canada said on its Twitter feed. Raif Badawi’s wife Ensaf Haidar lives in Canada and recently became a Canadian citizen. Most of those arrested campaigned for the right to drive and an end to the country’s male ship system, which requires women to obtain the consent of a male relative for major decisions. The Saudi statement said it confirmed its commitment to refrain from intervening in the internal matters of other countries, including Canada, and in return rejected any intervention in its domestic affairs and internal relations with its citizens. “Any further step from the Canadian side in that direction will be considered as acknowledgment of our right to interfere in the Canadian domestic affairs,” the statement said.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3587092.1533477487!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"poolbeg incinerator s appetite for waste is a question of calories","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Poolbeg incinerator’s plume can appear red at night because of aviation warning lights on the chimney stacks. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillJohn Daly, managing director at Covanta Ireland, knows the Poolbeg incinerator, or waste-to-energy plant to give it its official title, is not the most popular kid on the block.“We get blamed for everything,” he says.Given who the other kids on the block are, it’s easy to see why he might think this unfair.“We are sitting here next to the waste water treatment plant, we’ve got two other power plants here, we’ve got a scrap yard across the road, but still, we get blamed for everything.”Specifically, he references a fly infestation last summer, described by some locals as “biblical”. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found “moderate fly numbers” in the waste intake building and bunker area, but Mr Daly says flies are not a new problem in the area. “It would be crazy to think we wouldn’t have flies, if everyone else in Ringsend and Irishtown had flies.”Other accusations levelled against the plant are completely without foundation, he says. “People see the white plume coming out of the stack and think it’s smoke. It’s just like a kettle, it’s just water vapour.”He says he finds this a more reasonable misconception than the flies, however.“We’ve even had a few calls from people saying there are flames coming out of the stack, and I’ve thought: ‘What is that person on?’” This, he says, is a visual effect caused by the red aviation lights on the chimney stacks making the white plume appear red at night. “It’s funny, I never thought about it until I saw it myself, and I see what people are saying . . . It actually does look like a flame.”More seriously, the plant has had some genuine failings to answer. A lime leak in the first week of operations resulted in 11 workers being hospitalised. “Any incident involving health safety is serious, but they’re all fine. They were all back working within a few days and they’ve all been compensated,” Mr Daly says.The EPA took legal action against the firm in relation to a separate incident in the first week of operation, when it failed to comply with the terms of its environmental licence during testing of the plant. Earlier this year Covanta was fined €1,000 for the breaches.However, one year on, these teething problems have been resolved and the plant is running safely and efficiently, Mr Daly says.Dioxin and furan levels are 98.8 per cent below the European Union permitted limits bottom ash, the main waste product left over after incineration is 16 per cent below what was predicted when planning permission was sought for the plant and the number of trucks delivering waste to the plant is also 25 per cent fewer than originally planned.Which all stacks up in favour of a potential expansion of the plant, but does not explain how the plant could go from taking in 600,000 tonnes to 690,000 tonnes of waste a year, without any need to physically expand the plant.The answer mainly lies, Mr Daly says in the “calorific value” of the waste that’s arriving at the plant.“The calorific value is about 10 per cent below what was originally envisaged. That is really because there’s been a very successful roll-out of the three-bin system in the intervening period,” he says. “The three-bin system has meant that paper and plastics, higher calorific value materials, are out of that system.”As with food, the calorific value of waste is the amount of energy it contains. In terms of incineration, the easiest way to understand its relevance is to relate it to a domestic hearth, EPA enforcement inspector Pat Byrne says.“If you put peat on an open fire it will burn more quickly than if you put coal on, and you’ll have to add more peat more often to keep the fire going – peat having a lower calorific value than coal.”The same theory can be applied to any fuel source, and for an incinerator waste is a fuel. “Different types of waste will have different calorific values, for example the more damp waste is the lower the calorific value. It’s basically to do with the amount of heat you get from any quantity of waste,” Mr Byrne says.Mr Daly hopes to make the planning application this year, with a view to getting an answer from the board in early 2019, ahead of the licence application to the EPA. If this process is successful, the company would hope to start taking the additional waste in 18 months’ time.“The fact there is no construction, the fact there is no requirement to change the hours, the fact we’re not going to look to take any hazardous material and the fact we are so much below the original forecasted impacts of both transport and emissions I think stands in our favour.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3587179.1533500634!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mcdonald restates sinn f%C3%A9in stance on unity poll after u turn","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald (at centre in green top) in procession during the 37th National Hunger Strike Commemoration in Castlewellan, Co Down, on Sunday.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireIt is now only a matter of “when” a Border poll will take place on Irish unity, Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said on Sunday, as she brushed aside her U-turn on the issue last week.Speaking at an event to commemorate the 1981 hunger strikes in Co Down, she spoke of republicanism being “renewed and revitalised” and said “the need for a referendum to end partition is writ large”.Last week, in an interview, Ms McDonald said the Border poll question should be put to one side until the “dangers” posed by Brexit were mitigated.But the following day, she declared there would have to be a Border poll if the UK crashed out of the European Union next year without an agreement.Opponents claimed she had been pressurised within the party to change tact, a claim denied by Sinn Féin, which argued that her comments were consistent.Addressing the republican crowd on Sunday, Ms McDonald said: “The time for a unity referendum is drawing near . . . It is not a question of if a unity referendum will happen but a question of when.“As Britain turns away from Europe, the appeal of being part of a new and outward-looking Ireland will, I believe, prove ever more attractive to some within the unionist community.”She added that British identity must be accommodated in a united Ireland and said unionists had the right “to celebrate their history and tradition, to recount their experience and suffering, and to remember and honour their dead must be, and will be respected”.She also said republicans’ “right to remember, commemorate, to honour our dead must be respected”.Thousands of republicans gathered in Castlewellan for the 37th “National Hunger Strike Commemoration”, the first time it has been held in Co Down, marking the anniversary of the deaths of 10 republican hunger strikers, including Bobby Sands and Raymond McCreesh, in 1981.The theme of Sunday’s commemorative parade through the town to a private landowner’s field, where Ms McDonald addressed the crowd, was “the journey”.In the field, stalls were selling republican-themed merchandise, including badges, books, CDs, jerseys, aprons and portraits of the late former first minster and ex-IRA chief Martin McGuinness. Rebel tunes played as young men played with hurleys and children played on the grass on their bicycles.When the parade arrived in the field South Down MP Chris Hazzard opened proceedings by thanking the families of the “patriot dead” hunger strikers for attending.South Down MLA Emma Rogan recited the poem What Compels Young Men to Die? before Cllr John Rice, who was referred to by a party colleague as a “POW”, read “our role of honour” to the hunger strikers.Young people were then involved in a New Ireland theatre piece called The Jigsaw. Each of the 32 had carried a large jigsaw piece of their county in the parade and then in the field they were added to a giant map of Ireland while information about notable republicans was read out.Ms McDonald then paid tribute to the hunger strikers, saying: “We will not let them be criminalised ever.”Ahead of the commemoration, families of victims of IRA violence said the event was “insulting” to their relatives memories and UUP representative Alan Lewis claimed Sinn Féin was “glorifying” terrorism.Among those to disagree with this claim was Noel Connolly, chair of Sinn Féin’s Grey Abbey Martyrs cumann, Kildare South. “We come here every year just to recognise sacrifice,” he said.“We recognise that a lot of people died in the conflict but everyone has the right to remember their dead, including loyalists and everyone else.”When former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams – who was mobbed in the field by republicans young and old for joint-selfies and photographs – was asked by a reporter at Stormont in 2016 when he would like to see a Border poll he replied “Yesterday”, and that was the feeling among many others in Castlewellan.A 51 per cent win would be “a shame but we would obviously accept it, but we would like to persuade people and that will be done by selling the benefits of unity,” Mr Connolly said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3585880.1533323004!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"superstar judge emerges as an unlikely champion for liberals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSupreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has a cult-like following. Photograph: by Michael KovacGetty ImagesSometimes heroes come from the most unlikely places. For millions of progressive Americans who continue to look on aghast at Donald Trump’s presidency, there was some good news this week.On Sunday night, Twitter lit up with breaking news.Supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had just suggested during an interview in New York that she would stay on the bench for at least five more years.The joy was unfettered. #RuthBaderGinsburg was trending on the social media platform, while fans across the country expressed their joy. “I hope you live forever, RBG,” said one.\u0026nbspThe 85-year-old Ginsburg has become an unlikely champion of liberals across the country, attracting a cult-like following usually reserved for pop stars or celebrities.The roots of her fame began at the start of this decade. After a number of dissenting judgments, including in the famous Shelby County v Holder case on voting rights, she was incarnated as an internet meme, which compared her to the rapper Notorious BIG.Such was the meme’s popularity that its creator teamed up with an MSNBC journalist to pen a book, Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. It became a New York Times bestseller.Earlier this summer a film adaptation of the book hit cinemas across the US, cementing her celebrity. Outside the movie theatre in Georgetown fans queued up outside the lifesize cardboard cutout of RBG for photos.The film recounts the story of Ginsburg’s life, tracing her career trajectory from her upbringing in a Jewish household in Brooklyn in the 1930s to her appointment by Bill Clinton to the supreme court in 1993.Having graduated from Cornell, she went to Harvard Law School, one of nine women in the 500-strong class. She recounts in the film how she was scolded by a dean for taking a seat that could have been occupied by a man. These early experiences of prejudice informed her career as a lawyer.In the 1960s and 1970s she rose to prominence, taking on – and winning – landmark cases on gender equality. She argued six gender discrimination cases before the US supreme court between 1973 and 1976, including a case which successfully argued that widowers – as well as widows – should be eligible for social security payments if they choose to mind children in the home after the death of a spouse.While the film charts Ginsburg’s remarkable career, it also sheds light on her personal life.Throughout the film, Ginsburg’s natural reserve and seriousness comes through, an antidote to the gregarious personality of her late husband, who remained a constant presence by her side before his death in 2010. But it shows how the elegant octogenarian has embraced her recent fame with a bemused, tongue-in-cheek air.The film includes footage of the justice working out with her personal trainer, and watching Saturday Night Live impersonations of herself on TV.Her friendship with the late Antonin Scalia, her colleague on the supreme court, is also explored. Their friendship, despite their very different political leanings, is a reminder of the importance of bipartisanship at a time when America is so ided politically.Ginsburg’s promise to remain on the bench for at least five years has been greeted with relief by her fans, amid concerns about her health in recent years. She has survived cancer, twice, and was famously caught napping during the State of the Union address in 2015.Trump has so far been gifted the appointment of two supreme court nominees – Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who is expected to be confirmed by the senate in the autumn. Liberals do not want the 45th president to have the opportunity to nominate a third.Ginsburg’s comments this week emerged as Kavanaugh continued to meet privately with senators on Capitol Hill as Washington starts to wind down for the summer. His confirmation hearing is expected to take place next month, with Republicans aiming to have the conservative nominee in place by the opening of the new court session on October 1st.While Kavanaugh is likely to face a tough confirmation hearing – his statements that he does not believe sitting presidents should be prosecuted have raised eyebrows – Republicans have the majority needed to approve him.Ginsburg, however, seems willing to stick the pace until a Democratic president is in place. For many, it is proof that she is a real patriot.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Man charged with murder of midwife Samantha EastwoodNorth Korea declares heatwave \u0026#39unprecedented natural disaster\u0026#39 as South resorts to \u0026#39ice vests\u0026#39Indonesia earthquake: At least 91 dead as tourists evacuated after \u0026#39massive\u0026#39 damageEleven children in US rescued from \u0026#39extremists\u0026#39 at \u0026#39filthy\u0026#39 hideoutThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendDonald Trump admits son met Russian to get information on Hillary ClintonDemi Lovato vows to \u0026#39keep fighting\u0026#39 in first statement about suspected overdoseWarning over online GPs as struck-off doctor discovered using loophole to prescribe \u0026#39unsafe\u0026#39 drugsSurrey police said death of Russian whistle-blower should be turned into a \u0026#39non-issue\u0026#39 Venezuela braces for blowback as Nicolas Maduro says he survived drone assassination attemptUnforgotten, series 3 episode 4: so every one of these men is despicable, but are they killers?Comment: Denmark has got it wrong.

Turns out I just needed to go walking in Leytonstone instead.RSPCA inspector Rebecca Bedson said: “We received a call yesterday morning reporting a stray snake in High Road, Leytonstone. I arrived to find the boa constrictor in a box and transported him to a wildlife centre where he is currently being assessed.The boa constrictor was seen eating the pigeon in Leytonstone, east London “I’m very keen to find out how he came to be in such a dangerous situation. Exposed like that on a street could have meant anything might have happened to him, he could have been run over by a car or attacked by another animal.“It might be that he is an escaped pet, or more worryingly, someone may have deliberately dumped him and left him to fend for himself. Either way, anybody with any information can give me a call in complete confidence on our inspector’s appeal line by phoning 0300 123 8018.” The charity said that it is encountering widespread neglect of reptiles as many people are unaware of how much of a commitment these animals are when they take them on.  As a result they now rescue hundreds each year. Man charged with murder of midwife Samantha EastwoodNorth Korea declares heatwave \u0026#39unprecedented natural disaster\u0026#39 as South resorts to \u0026#39ice vests\u0026#39Indonesia earthquake: At least 91 dead as tourists evacuated after \u0026#39massive\u0026#39 damageEleven children in US rescued from \u0026#39extremists\u0026#39 at \u0026#39filthy\u0026#39 hideoutThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendDonald Trump admits son met Russian to get information on Hillary ClintonDemi Lovato vows to \u0026#39keep fighting\u0026#39 in first statement about suspected overdoseWarning over online GPs as struck-off doctor discovered using loophole to prescribe \u0026#39unsafe\u0026#39 drugsSurrey police said death of Russian whistle-blower should be turned into a \u0026#39non-issue\u0026#39 Venezuela braces for blowback as Nicolas Maduro says he survived drone assassination attemptUnforgotten, series 3 episode 4: so every one of these men is despicable, but are they killers?Comment: Denmark has got it wrong.

PGT works on the principle that negative pregnancies and miscarriages can be minimised by screening these abnormal embryos before they’re implanted.While NHS\u0026nbspclinics screen for genetic diseases PGT is not routinely offered, however the increasing postcode lottery for patients as cash-strapped regions cut funding for IVF cycles means many more people use private services.It is just one of a range of add-on (adjuvant) therapies and tests which clinics say are necessary to achieve the best results.However The Independent has revealed how UK fertility watchdogs are highly suspicious of inflated success rates being advertised to UK couples, which some overseas groups claim are as high as 98 per cent.“All too often couples requiring IVF treatment are taken for a ride when it comes to a bewildering array of unproven tests and adjuvant treatments,” said Professor Jan Brosens, an obstetrics and gynaecology expert at the University of Warwick, who was not involved in the study.“This smartly designed and well conducted study was designed to give couples clear-cut information on whether PGT-A increases the chance of having a baby within one year.The study, which followed 396 women across nine fertility centres in seven countries, randomly allocated half the participants have either abnormality screening through PGT, or just IVF.Health news in pictures150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms. Melissa Whiteley, an 18-year-old engineering student from Hanford in Stoke-on-Trent, fell ill at Christmas and died in hospital a month later.650 Government to review thousands of harmful vaginal mesh implantsThe Government has pledged to review tens of thousands of cases where women have been given harmful vaginal mesh implants.750 Jeremy Hunt announces \u0027zero suicides ambition\u0027 for the NHSThe NHS will be asked to go further to prevent the deaths of patients in its care as part of a “zero suicide ambition” being launched today.850 Human trials start with cancer treatment that primes immune system to kill off tumoursHuman trials have begun with a new cancer therapy that can prime the immune system to eradicate tumours. The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 950 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.1050 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.1150 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.1250 Malnutrition deaths in hospitals in England and Wales at highest level for a decadeThe number of people dying in hospital as a result of malnutrition has hit its highest level for a decade, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. Death certificates from England and Wales show that malnutrition was listed as the primary cause in a total of 66 deaths in 2016.1350 Fertility \u0027breakthrough\u0027 as human eggs grown in lab for first timeHuman eggs with the potential to become fertilised embryos have been grown in a laboratory for the first time in a breakthrough that could unlock future fertility treatments. 1450 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.1550 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues1650 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded1750 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively1850 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2050 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2350 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2450 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2550 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2650 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2750 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say2850 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed2950 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3050 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3150 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3250 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3350 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3450 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3650 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3750 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).3850 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.3950 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.The number of women who had a live birth within 12 months of the study was identical in both groups, at 24 per cent. It did find that women who had PGT screening were significantly less likely to have a miscarriage and this may be enough to sway some couples.\u0026nbsp“Many IVF clinics may well erroneously seize this as a ‘selling point’ for PGT-A,” said professor of reproductive medicine at the University of Southampton, Ying Cheong, who was not involved in the study.“It needs to be emphasised that these are secondary end-points which the study was not powered to definitively answer and so must be interpreted with caution.She said biopsies of embryos for PGT if there was no evidence it worked “is poor clinical practice”, adding: “We still do not understand fully the developmental biology of the egg and the embryo, and as such, may cause more harm than good.“For these reasons, it is my opinion that PGT-A should not be offered to women with advanced maternal age.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/02/14/decent-housing-hospital-admissions.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/02/14/decent-housing-hospital-admissions.jpg","title":"gentrification bristol urban renewal cities london frome peckham los angeles","story":"Created with Sketch.In Bristol last year, notices appeared with a slogan hitting back at hipster hotspots\u0026nbspand playgrounds for the rich. Since then, areas like\u0026nbspPeckham and Frome\u0026nbsphave taken the message on as their ownClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom Bristol to LA: The anti-gentrification posters sweeping through our citiesLast summer, stickers and posters began to appear on the walls of Bristol. In a gnomic parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again“ they read “Make Bristol Shit Again”, and were plastered over the city’s gentrifying high-tide areas, such as Stokes Croft and St Pauls.\u0026nbspThe city talked. Vice magazine did a piece about it, and MBSA went viral as both an exemplar of the city’s mordant humour and a plea against gentrification.“My hometown is becoming an extension of London, and losing its crappy edge,” wrote Vice’s Angus Harrison in a bittersweet excoriation of Bristol’s new-found glossiness.\u0026nbspMBSA might have been a one-off valedictory howl, but in an act of synchronicity, other “Shit Again” activity arrived.In Peckham, the southeast London district previously known for being the location of Only Fools and Horses and latterly for being a hipster hotspot, a “Make Peckham Shit Again” landed\u0026nbspin March, as did a Twitter account called “Make Frome Shit Again” along with a few MFSA hashtags of the same vintage.\u0026nbsp(In an odd circularity, much of Only Fools and Horses, although set in\u0026nbspPeckham, was actually filmed in Bristol.)\u0026nbspBristolStreetWearUK)Then, this spring an international brigade of “Shit Again” warriors\u0026nbspin Los Angeles in the form of “Make Venice Shit Again” (Venice the hippyish LA district, to be clear, not the Birmingham of Italy).Such was its clout that Hollywood actor Josh Brolin sported a MVSA baseball cap, part of a local atmosphere so heightened that a recent LA Weekly story found cause to lament that in Venice, “You’ll sooner find a $200 (£150) wool poncho than a $12 pair of flip-flops.”\u0026nbspSo the “Shit Again” tag somehow hit the mark, both as a lament to the new and deracinated world of overpriced and socially exclusive development, and as a great merchandise idea in its own right. So there’s a MBSA hat, T-shirt and even “laptop skins”, while MVSA baseball caps retail at $30 and MPSA baseball caps a snip at a tenner.\u0026nbspAs Tumbleweed Parker puts it (not his real name) his Make Peckham Shit Again hats were a response to Trump’s MAGA cap as well as a way to protest the gentrification of Peckham, which has deep roots but has gathered pace in the last five years as a domino in what you might call the “de-shitting” of London.“Before Trump I’d been thinking about doing some merchandise to kick back against all the happy-clappy local pride movements that seemed to spring up after the London riots in 2011,” says Parker.Peckham-based rockers Fat White Family (centre) wears a ‘Make Peckham Shit Again’ cap with siblings Sasha and Vida Adamczewski (Morbid Books)“It’s delusional to think London’s the best place in the world when its homegrown youth are so desperate to burn it down, and Sadiq Khan’s idiotic marketing of London is used to sell it off to developers.”Moreover, he adds, “people can’t afford to live in this so-called paradise”. So in its own way, the hats and T-shirts are a kind of Situationist protest or, as he puts it, “a barricade against the unhelpful narrative that Peckham is, was, or ever could be a great place for property speculators. I think it’s important that we say, it’s actually not that great.”So is this ‘Shit Again’ activity really a hankering for the days of shuttered high streets without good coffee: a kind of “Fings Ain’t What They Used to Be” for disgruntled millennials? Possibly: the creator\u0026nbspof Make Bristol Shit Again, Bristolstreetwear, bears the legend “Say no to sourdough” on its website, and certainly, there’s a sense of loss about gentrification’s march through the neighbourhoods: the sticky-carpet pubs turning into homes, the chain stores pushing out independents, and £3-a-cup flat whites and avocado-on-spelt ousting the chipped mug of tea and sausage sarnie.Frome\u0026nbspis known for its independent shops and cobbled street\u0026nbsp(Shutterstock)The protestors are also needled by endless proclamations of arrival, such as Frome’s topping the charts as a good place to move, and Bristol winning The Sunday Times’ “best place to live in the UK” gong: the kind of boosterism that gives some locals the impression their towns are forgotten backwaters just itching to be discovered.It’s rattled further by development that piggybacks on existing “bohemian” infrastructure, such as Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the loss of artist-occupied warehouses and office blocks like Hamilton House have sparked long battles.Yet perhaps there’s something else afoot too: a nostalgie de la boue for the old townscape of sticky boozers and crap shops where people supposedly felt a sense of belonging.The term “gentrification” was minted in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass with reference to Islington, then attracting the middle classes into areas full of multi-occupied late Georgian and early Victorian houses, where they set about losing the net curtains and exposing the floorboards, hence the contemporary jibe, “stripped pine-eers”. Indeed, today’s neo-gentrifiers still like their decoration “raw”, although these days it’s more about bare bricks, old shops and and cocktails in jam jars. And there has long been a missionary-like flavour about the process, whereby gentrifiers comes into an unreconstructed urban district, “discover” it anew and turn it into a mirror of their own taste.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWoodage  Twitter)But the idea of what gentrification constitutes has shifted, says Loretta Lees, a professor of human geography at the University of Leicester and author of several books on the matter, including Planetary Gentrification. “I’ve noticed that anti-gentrification has become more performative in the last two to three years,” says Lees. “The traditional class aspect of it has given way to a more complicated scenario, full of internal conflict, where critics of gentrification are often gentrifiers themselves and where the discussion is more about consumerism more than class.”The 2017 book Gentrifier by John Joe Schlichtman, Jason Patch and Marc Lamont Hill also works this theme with a look at how gentrification\u0026nbspis now commonly used as a means to describe clothing choices, food and art, often centred around the cipher-like figure of the “hipster“ and part of a battle for the authentic soul of a place.Shoreditch (Jamie OsmanTwitter)“Imagined realities and physical realities collide in gentrification,“ they wrote. This aspect became apparent in 2015, when a demonstration against a branch of the Cereal Cafe in London’s Brick Lane bought a sense of pantomime to the debate, while in 2016 Montreal’s local government introduced a by-law that no more than one in six businesses can be a restaurant: a move that has been seen as a way of moderating gentrification.\u0026nbspAlamy)So the new symbols of gentrification – the cortados, chachka shops and themed restaurants – began to seemingly represent a force that was making Bristol want to be shit again, as well as rippling out anxiously to other corners of the country. It’s a phenomenon that Lees says has seen “gentrification move on from key world cities to rural areas, market towns and ‘edge cities’ – places on the margins of urban areas”. One of the key differences between the Ruth Glass era and now is that gentrification has been globalised and also exists in miniature.\u0026nbspTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesDonald Trump has been scared off by a big balloonLondon to get first permanent LGBT+ homeless shelterAs for Frome becoming “shit again”, she says that the actual long-term locals want a post office, a good supermarket and a Peacocks: all things that\u0026nbspmight not be the grails of a “down from London” person’s eye.\u0026nbspThere’s also a streak of self-deprecation that runs through a certain British mentality, as seen in Crap Towns, the 1990s hit, bringing the “declinism” of the 1980s up to date. Then, things could only get worse. And surely gentrification can sometimes be good? Lees draws a moral distinction between the “gentrification that displaces people, and the good regeneration that keeps people in place”, but struggles to think of a good example of the latter.In 2015, research from the US magazine City Lab concluded that gentrifying neighbourhoods don’t actually lose low-income residents at a substantially lower rate than any other neighbourhood. Plus, it should be said, there’s nothing gentrifiers scorn more than other gentrifiers. It’s fun to have a pop.\u0026nbspPerhaps “shit again” means affordable housing and a regaining of convivial civic life, or perhaps it’s an aesthetic of urban decline. Whatever, a “shit again” cap is the perfect self-abnegating gift for an uncertain age. “It seems to be resonating with a lot of people who feel alienated by the discourse of positivity around urban redevelopment, which is most people I know,” says Parker. “Even the local estate agent ordered one. I hope he wears it when he hangs himself.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/12/12/mark-billingham-1.jpg","title":"long reads hero sas who dares wins culture tv marvel","story":"Created with Sketch.Is he a Marvel-esque superhuman or an SAS daredevil?

Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt. Billingham has been an A-list bodyguard to Michael Caine and Russell Crowe and he hasn’t lost anyone yet. He says the main difference with\u0026nbspCrowe is that “you spend a lot of your time trying to stop him picking fights”. Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?T.E Lawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

But we know a growing percentage are kept indoors in Britain and never experience sunlight on their backs or grass under their feet.\u0026nbspBernard Matthews labels show the countryside with green grass but the reality of life for their turkeys is probably anything but outdoors. We suspect they are raised intensively because the company doesn\u0027t participate in any assurance schemes.He added: “If consumers could see behind closed doors they’d be shocked.\u0026nbspIf a pig is kept intensively all its life – with mother sows unable to even turn around to interact with her young – shoppers should be told.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspbrands we\u0027ve highlighted are just the tip of the iceberg - there are many out there with misleading labels.​CiWF is about to launch a petition calling on the government to make it compulsory for food firms to state the method of production on labels.“Labels on intensively reared products frequently display misleading images of rolling landscapes and happy animals, when in reality the livestock are crammed into barren cages, kept indoors all their lives or kept in such close confinement that they are unable to express their natural behaviours,” Bronwen Reinhardt, honest labelling campaign manager at CiWF.Misleading slogans and images undermine farmers who genuinely operate to high welfare standards, she said.Earlier this year the environment department (Defra) ran a public consultation on the future of food and farming after Brexit, with a document that said: “It is not always clear to the consumer what standards underpin welfare terminology and definitions on labels, such as ‘grass-fed’, can vary between retailers. We are considering whether providing greater clarity of information to consumers could support higher welfare production.”In a speech in January, environment secretary Michael Gove said: “I want us, outside the European Union, to develop new approaches to food labelling… there’s still no single, scaled, measure of how a farmer or food producer performs against a sensible basket of indicators, taking into account such things as soil health, control of pollution, contribution to water quality as well as animal welfare.“We’ve been in discussion with farmers and food producers about how we might advance such a scheme and I think that, outside the EU, we could establish a measure of farm and food quality which would be world-leading.”More appropriate slogans would be ‘raised in confinement’ or ‘grown quickly without access to the outdoors’Mr Gifford said what’s needed is a system similar to that introduced for eggs in 2004 that made production method labelling compulsory, after which free-range and organic egg sales “went through the roof”.Mandatory production and slaughter method labelling was one policy Labour promised in its 50-point animal-welfare plan published in February.As milk prices have fallen in recent years, under-pressure farmers have moved towards more intensive systems, building vast sheds packed with dairy cows who are fed not on grass but on protein-heavy diets to boost milk production.Research by World Animal Protection has found Britain now has about 100 industrial “mega-farms”, each housing up to 3,000 cows that are kept permanently indoors.CiWF)Many farms keep cattle indoors some of the time and allow them outdoors at other times.But some have estimated that all “zero-grazing” systems – accused of causing painful lameness and mastitis because cows stand on concrete floors for prolonged periods – are in place in one in five British dairy farms.\u0026nbspAccording to Labelling Matters, a coalition of groups lobbying since 2011 for a law on production method labelling, such a step would benefit not just shoppers and farm animals but farmers too, creating a level playing field for them.A spokeswoman for Mondelez, which owns the Dairylea brand, said: “The farmers that supply to us graze their cows whenever weather conditions and location allows, and wherever this is appropriate and manageable from their perspective.\u0026nbspTherefore, it is not practical or possible for us to guarantee that 100 per cent of the cows providing our milk can graze 100 per cent of the time.\u0026nbsp“Ensuring that suppliers take good care of their herds is fundamental to ensuring our cheeses are made with high-quality milk. The environment in which the cows are kept is a key part of that and protecting them from physical and thermal discomfort, fear and distress is a priority for our suppliers.”The Independent has asked the Two Sisters Food Group, owner of the Bernard Matthews brand, for a comment but had not received one at the time of publication.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/12/24/19/web-uk-troops-pa.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/12/24/19/web-uk-troops-pa.jpg","title":"sas helicopter low flying driver dash cam lake district cumbria","story":"Created with Sketch.Brian Weatherall and family come within metres of passing helicopter in Lake DistrictClick to followThe Independent Online\u0027SAS\u0027 helicopter leaves driver startled after coming within feet of roadA driver said he was thankful for a lucky escape after a\u0026nbspclose encounter with a helicopter\u0026nbspin the Lake District.Brian Weatherall, 45, was\u0026nbspdriving along a misty lane in\u0026nbspKirkstone Pass\u0026nbspwith his family when the aircraft emerged unexpectedly from the fog, forcing him to hit the brakes.Dash-cam footage of the incident shows the aircraft passing with\u0026nbspwithin metres of his\u0026nbspcar.After the helicopter disappeared\u0026nbspfrom sight, Mr Weatherall can be heard saying to his family: “Dear me.

said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDomestic abuse risk posed by universal credit overhaul, MPs warnUniversal credit forces people into debt due to complex processesMcVey accused of still misleading MPs over universal creditCorbyn ignores universal credit row to attack May on bus policyProblems can arise from the\u0026nbspsystem over-calculating\u0026nbspthe earnings of those\u0026nbsppaid on a four-weekly basis, simply because two paydays can fall within one calendar month.Being paid early as a result of weekends or bank holidays can also make it look like a worker has earned more because they receive two payments in a month.Back pay and tax rebates can also trigger the problem, the charity warned.“Universal credit isn\u0027t working for working people,” said Alison\u0026nbspGarnham,\u0026nbspCPAG\u0026nbspchief executive. “In the worst cases, people are losing out on significant amounts of money – hundreds of pounds over the course of a year – simply because of when their paydays and assessment periods fall.“But we believe most of the problems created by the monthly assessment system can be fixed relatively easily if the political will is there.”CPAG called for reforms to the system, including allowing claimants to change the date of their assessments\u0026nbspso they do not clash with paydays.“The mass migration of families on to universal credit should not begin until these fundamental problems are resolved,” Ms Garnham said.Life on the poverty line: Breadline BritainThe government’s flagship welfare reform has been beset with difficulties since it was first introduced in 2013.When the plan for universal credit was first announced, it was sold as a way of simplifying\u0026nbspthe UK’s benefit system.It was supposed to be sophisticated enough to adjust to people’s changing earnings in real time, but Ms Garham said the system operates using a “huge oversimplification” which is failing to reflect the reality of people’s lives.Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said it was “wrong” for working people to be losing out\u0026nbspbecause of ongoing flaws in the system.“This is causing chaos as this report starkly highlights,” he said. “The government has created this mess and it needs fixing quickly.”A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman responded: “We are listening to stakeholders’ concerns and

People’s Vote, which hopes to force a vote on the motion at Labour’s\u0026nbspannual conference in Liverpool in\u0026nbspSeptember.The group said more than 130 constituency\u0026nbspLabour parties (CLPs) across the country will discuss the\u0026nbspmotion on Brexit and vote on whether they want to propose it for discussion at the conference. Some have already agreed to do so.Each CLP is allowed to propose one motion for discussion at conference, with those receiving the most support from delegates at the gathering likely to be put to a vote. The window for submitting motions opened today.The motion could become party policy if passed, but the Labour leadership is\u0026nbsplikely to strongly resist attempts to force it to change tack.Last year, grassroots attempts to have Brexit debated by delegates at\u0026nbspparty conference\u0026nbspwere seen off by Mr Corbyn’s team and trade union Unite, who\u0026nbspfeared they could force a change in party policy.The latest campaign was endorsed by a number of prominent Labour figures.Manuel\u0026nbspCortes,\u0026nbspgeneral secretary of the\u0026nbspTSSA\u0026nbsptrade union, said:\u0026nbsp“Brexit is a Tory con trick for the benefit of the richest one per cent.

All of this will bind the hands of a future Labour government, and will make it far harder for us to deliver on our promises.”It says Labour must “oppose any Brexit deal that does not satisfy Labour’s six\u0026nbsptests” and instead “call for an immediate general election, and make a manifesto commitment to call a public vote on the Brexit deal with an option to remain in the EU if the public rejects it”.Leading scientists back call for Brexit deal voteMore than 500,000 back The Independent’s Final Say on Brexit campaignAs a Momentum member, this is why I back a Final SayNational Union of Students backs The Independent’s Final Say campaign If the party “cannot get a general election”, the motion says it should “campaign for a public vote on the deal with an option to remain in the EU and following a defeat for the government,\u0026nbspcall for an immediate general election”.\u0026nbspThe launch of the campaign\u0026nbspcoincides with\u0026nbspa nationwide “Left Against Brexit” tour to encourage left-wing activists to speak out against Brexit.

But evidence suggests that\u0026nbspbiggest challenges lie aheadClick to followThe Independent OnlineEthiopia\u0027s prime minister Abiy Ahmed has been working to change to his country\u0027s political systemEthiopia’s new prime minister Abiy Ahmed has been embracing change, quite literally.\u0026nbspLast month, in what has become almost a trademark move, the beaming young leader of Africa’s second-largest nation hugged Isaias Afwerki, the autocratic president of erstwhile enemy Eritrea. Mr Ahmed\u0026nbsphas been similarly intimate with Ethiopian opposition figures released from prison or invited home.Those gestures symbolise his inclusive approach since becoming the leader in April, on the back of three years of rolling unrest that looked destined to degenerate into intensifying conflict. Although a treacherous road lies ahead, the wildly popular Mr Ahmed has already transformed the political landscape, giving hope to millions of a more harmonious future.His election by the ruling coalition in late March, after the previous premier resigned, was seen as a victory for reformist elements, but few foresaw the radicalism of Mr Ahmed’s first months, as he used the prime ministerial bully pulpit to engineer rapid change. This involved normalising relations with Mr Afwerki after a cold war lasting 18 years,\u0026nbspand opening up domestic politics to banned groups. While Ethiopia has endured violent transitions in the past, this looks like a liberal democratic coup, and brings into question the future role of a formerly omnipotent ruling coalition.The four-party Ethiopian Peoples’ Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), which 42-year-old Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspleads, has ruled the Horn of Africa powerhouse as a multinational federation since 1991, after it and Eritrean rebels overthrew a military regime. Eritrea then seceded, but the countries began a vicious two-year war in 1998 after falling out over trading arrangements.Over the last decade, the EPRDF government was known for impressive infrastructure and anti-poverty programmes, but also for authoritarianism. It prioritised control, rather than pluralism, which meant a restrictive space for journalists, opposition groups\u0026nbspand civil society activists. The result was EPRDF monopolisation of all legislative seats in a country of 100 million people, an ineffectual\u0026nbspmedia,\u0026nbspand few civil society challengers to the government’s agenda.The Marxist-Leninist structured party drew its mandate from delivering growth, also arguing the system was democratic as it involved mass participation in development programmes, particularly in rural areas. Meanwhile, the federation granted autonomy and protected the linguistic and cultural identities of Ethiopia’s multifarious ethnic communities, theoretically enhancing its customised democracy.The destabilising protests by the Oromo, Ethiopia’s most populous ethnicity with around 35 million people, have battered that narrative. And now Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspappears intent on upending the EPRDF system from within, in pursuit of conventional democratisation.The demonstrations in Oromia, which surrounds the capital, Addis Ababa, were driven by the smothering of dissent, historic complaints of marginalisation\u0026nbspand more prosaic concerns over unjust evictions as the EPRDF’s growth model bulldozed Oromo farmers’ rights.World news in picturesMembers of different security forces stand guard and take evidence after an explosion targeted President Nicolas Maduro, in Caracas, Venezuela, 04 August 2018.

Although the Oromo are represented by Mr Ahmed’s party in the EPRDF, where decision-making is evenly split, opponents said the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) retained control. That party formed the EPRDF, spearheaded the rebellion that brought it to power, and its chairperson, Meles Zenawi, led Ethiopia from 1991 until his death in 2012. TPLF fighters established a new military and dominated the upper echelons of intelligence agencies.As protests spread in 2016, security forces tried to quell the unrest with lethal force, which only served to energise a youthful movement. Foreign-based activists such as Jawar Mohammed disseminated evidence of the latest outrage. When a botched security operation led to a deadly stampede at an Oromo cultural festival, Mr Mohammed\u0026nbspcatalysed “five days of rage”. Nationwide, over the three years, more than 1,000 protesters were killed, while farms, factories and government offices were destroyed.Under former prime\u0026nbspminister Hailemariam Desalegn, the EPRDF struggled to cope. That was partly a result of its travails after Mr Zenawi’s death. Some economic momentum remained, but dams and railways were delayed, and the government struggled to manage the stresses of growth. The coalition was increasingly fractious, and concerns over maladministration and corruption festered. Late last year, the EPRDF politburo bemoaned its own leadership failures after a marathon meeting and announced plans to reboot democratisation. That led to some initial prisoner releases.With the wind at their backs, the Oromo\u0026nbspprotests surged once more, cutting off Addis Ababa with a strike and road blockages. Mr Desalegn\u0026nbspresigned in February and a second state of\u0026nbspemergency was enacted to try to\u0026nbspregain control. It was then that Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspmoved.He had risen to lieutenant\u0026nbspcolonel in the military and served as deputy administrator of the Information Network Security Agency before becoming a parliamentarian and government minister. But his route to the top was as a leading light in a revitalised Oromo wing of the EPRDF, which\u0026nbspcapitalised on the protests to press the demands for greater power and autonomy. In March, his party elected him chairperson, partly because of his eligibility for prime\u0026nbspminister as a national MP –\u0026nbspand within weeks\u0026nbsphe was sworn-in at parliament.Ethiopian man finds his family in Eritrea after 18 yearsAddisalem Hadgu, an Ethiopian state TV journalist, reacts after meeting his wife, Nitslal Abraha, for the first time in eighteen years after Ethiopian Airlines ET314 flight arrived in Asmara, Eritrea Addisalem Hadgu embraces his daughters at Asmara International Airport Addisalem Hadgu gets ready in his hotel room after arriving in Asmara to meet his family for the first time in eighteen years in AsmaraAddisalem Hadgu with his wife, Nitslal and his daughtersAddisalem Hadgu sits on a couch, meeting his immediate family members for the first timeAddisalem Hadgu embraces his daughter Danayt AddisalemAddisalem Hadgu, 58, an Ethiopian state TV journalist, meets his brother-in-law, Solomon Yemane, 48, a member of the Eritrean military, in front of his hotelAddisalem Hadgu, an Ethiopian state TV journalist, reacts after meeting his wife, Nitslal Abraha, for the first time in eighteen years after Ethiopian Airlines ET314 flight arrived in Asmara, Eritrea Addisalem Hadgu embraces his daughters at Asmara International Airport Addisalem Hadgu gets ready in his hotel room after arriving in Asmara to meet his family for the first time in eighteen years in AsmaraAddisalem Hadgu with his wife, Nitslal and his daughtersAddisalem Hadgu sits on a couch, meeting his immediate family members for the first timeAddisalem Hadgu embraces his daughter Danayt AddisalemAddisalem Hadgu, 58, an Ethiopian state TV journalist, meets his brother-in-law, Solomon Yemane, 48, a member of the Eritrean military, in front of his hotelMr Ahmed\u0026nbspcomes from a mixed religious background and speaks three of Ethiopia’s main languages. That ersity is reflected in his governing outlook. Accelerating the EPRDF plan, he released all political prisoners and coaxed rebels from the bush, while activists such as Mr Mohammed\u0026nbsphave also triumphantly returned. Common themes of Mr Ahmed’s speeches have been love and integration, and the intention appears to be for a hotchpotch of political actors to participate peacefully in elections in 2020.\u0026nbspThat requires legislative changes to refine a catchall anti-terrorism law and encourage independent journalism and political activism. And in a delicate balancing act, it also means reestablishing government control of security after the unrest and seismic changes to the EPRDF system created something of a power vacuum.In the last few months, amid the euphoria, ethnic violence has endured or broken out in various locations\u0026nbspanti-government activity has continued in Oromia, a grenade was thrown at a massive Addis Ababa rally attended by Mr Ahmed, and there has been an uptick in vigilante killings –\u0026nbspand possibly two high-profile assassinations.Opinions vary starkly on the causes. After they lost control of the security apparatus, many blame TPLF-linked agitators, which has contributed to lethal attacks on Tigrayans, creating fear among that community. But it is evident that many disputes are driven by local dynamics, rather than purely resulting from external provocation.For example, the six million strong Sidama people are pressing a long held claim for their own region. In western Oromia, popular support for the Oromo Liberation Front bred fighting between regional forces and a holdout faction of the insurgency, while territorial clashes continued between the Oromo and neighbouring groups in the east and southeast. The federal government took a forceful step yesterday by sending in the military to assert control of Somali region and its unruly president.Assuming the security situation soon finally stabilises, non-violent politics will hopefully take centre stage. In recent years, much opposition activity has been focused on campaigning against the TPLF. But with its officials mostly now removed from top federal government positions, other fault lines will emerge. The overarching one is the federation comprising ethnic administrative units, which some opposition groups argue foments sectarianism. Defenders argue it can thrive in a democratised environment, but others counter that it has been the reach and grip of the EPRDF that has held the constitutional arrangement together thus far.\u0026nbspA further major challenge is economic. A vital aspect of the EPRDF operation was channelling financial resources into much-needed infrastructure to build the backbone of a modern market economy. That model is now in question with Abiy\u0026nbspAhmed’s government ramping up a privatisation programme as the state’s capacity for public investment dwindles. It is questionable that this more liberal approach can deliver the growth or the structural transformation that a still poor and agrarian economy desperately needs.Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwields great power, commands massive support\u0026nbspand has achieved a huge amount in a short space of time. But the evidence suggests that the biggest challenges to completing his transformative agenda lie ahead.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/04/17/duststorm.jpg","title":"phoenix dust storm wall cloud weather in pictures","story":"Created with Sketch.The \u0027haboob\u0027 was formed as strong winds churned up dust following a thunderstormClick to followThe Independent USA towering apocalyptic wall of dust\u0026nbsphas engulfed Arizona\u0026nbspcity of Phoenix.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspKnown as a haboob, the cloud was almost a mile high and 230ft\u0026nbspwide as it swept in from the desert, leading to near-zero visibility, flight delays and treacherous on the roads.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAncient Maya civilisation \u0027destroyed by massive drought\u0027Water company bosses asked to explain failure to tackle leaksSevere drought threatens wild horses in American WestHaboob is the Arabic term for a giant dust storm.

Overheated waters can result in mass fish die-offs, like those that occurred in Germany this week.The shutdowns are just the latest inconvenience in the heat wave that has descended on much of Europe in recent weeks. A drought sweeping Switzerland has left herds of cows stranded without water. The\u0026nbspcountry’s helicopter association and Air Force have been called to transport tens of thousands of gallons of water every week to sustain them.Earlier this week, officials warned vacationers in Portugal and Spain\u0026nbspto stay indoors, as parts of the region reached record-setting high temperatures. Meteorologists predicted some areas could beat the highest temperature ever recorded in Europe – 48C, recorded in Athens, Greece, in July 1977.Spanish and Portuguese\u0026nbspweather services put a health warning in place until Sunday, noting that temperatures would be especially severe in the southwest. At least three people in Spain have already reportedly died from heatstroke.Wildfires have also sprung up in Portugal’s Algarve, mirroring the deadly fires burning in Greece, Sweden, and the west coast of the United States. Scientists previously told The Independent that such fires were becoming more common, and more intense, due to climate change.A recently released study from the University of Oxford found that climate change had more than doubled the likelihood of the current heat wave.“The logic that climate change will do this is inescapable – the world is becoming warmer and so heatwaves like this are becoming more common,” said one of the report’s authors, Dr Friederike Otto, deputy director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford.“What was once regarded as unusually warm weather will become commonplace – in some cases, it already has, he said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/05/17/steven-seagal-putin.jpg","title":"steven seagal us russia envoy hollywood putin humanitarian","story":"Created with Sketch.Hollywood actor who once\u0026nbspdescribed Vladimir Putin as\u0026nbsp\u0027one of the greatest world leaders’,\u0026nbspwas granted Russian citizenship in 2016Click to followThe Independent OnlinePresident Putin shakes hands with Steven Seagal during a meeting at the Kremlin in November 2016Russia has appointed martial artist and action film star Steven Seagal\u0026nbspas a special envoy to improve ties with the United States.\u0026nbspIn a Facebook post, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced that the Under Siege as been appointed to a new role, which allegedly will\u0026nbspbe unpaid.His responsibility will be to “facilitate relations between Russia and the United States in the humanitarian field, including cooperation in culture, arts, public and youth exchanges.”In 2015,\u0026nbspBuzzFeed\u0026nbspNews reported that two years earlier, Vladimir Putin had suggested to then President Barack Obama that he could make Mr Seagal\u0026nbspthe honorary Russian consul to California and Arizona.\u0026nbsp​Then in November 2016, Mr Seagal visited the Russian president at the Kremlin and was granted Russian citizenship.\u0026nbspSeagal\u0027s grandmother was born in Vlaostok\u0026nbspand the actor and Mr Putin share a passion for martial arts.In a 2013 interview with news channel RT, Seagal\u0026nbspsaid he believed Mr Putin was\u0026nbspone of the greatest world leaders, if not the greatest world leader, alive today.”\u0026nbspSteven Seagal accused of rape by extra from 1994 filmSteven Seagal calls female reporters \u0027a bunch of f***ing dirty whores\u0027Steven Seagal comments on NFL protests, debuts bizarre new lookBut Seagal has faced some criticism for some comments he has made about the controversial Russian leader.After he\u0026nbsppraised Putin\u0027s annexation of Crimea,\u0026nbspKiev banned\u0026nbspSeagal\u0026nbspfrom entering Ukraine for five years, claiming he had\u0026nbsp“committed socially dangerous actions” that could threaten their security.\u0026nbspSeagal was also granted Serbian citizenship in 2016, after he offered\u0026nbspto open a martial arts academy in Belgrade.The action film star has also met with Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Belarusan President Alexander Lukashenko.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/Lord-Blunkett-warned-Remainers-999325.jpg","title":"brexit no deal david blunkett second vote reject","story":"Lord Blunkett warned Remainers  (Image: EMPICS)He also rejected claims by fellow Labour peer Lord Mandelson that people who wanted to quit over immigration concerns were \u0026ldquoracist.Lord Blunkett, former home secretary and education secretary, argued \u0026ldquopeople believed our democracy and political system did not reflect their concerns and their cry for help following the impact of the financial crash and austerity.In a Sunday newspaper, he said: \u0026ldquoTo understand this, and why, if there were to be a second referendum now, I believe that the majority would still vote to leave, is critical if we are to get our democratic system back on track.

Heres the latest on the UK water shortage...Millions of Brits in the North West were facing up to the prospect of a hosepipe ban.On July 16, it was announced United Utilities would restrict hosepipe use for seven million households from August 5.The Sun had exclusively revealed the firms plans to introduce a ban after it urged customers to ditch baths for a quick shower.However, the proposed ban was called off on August 2 as the group cited increased rainfall, lower temperatures and decreased water consumption.It came after people across the country are being urged to be water wise by letting their lawns go yellowy-brown and not washing the car.But elsewhere in England and Wales, water companies said they had no plans for a hosepipe ban.The Department for the Environment has asked people to limit their showers to no longer than four minutes.And people are encouraged to think of ways to cut water use — turning taps off when brushing teeth, fixing leaks and only watering plants when absolutely necessary.United Utilities looks after water supplies in the North West of England.It had announced a temporary use ban which had been due to come into force on Sunday, August 5, but that has now been cancelled.Northern Ireland Water, in charge of the water supplies in Northern Ireland, issued a hosepipe ban on June 29 amid the ongoing heatwave.It limits the use of tap water for essentials like drinking, cooking and washing.It bans the following:Severn Trent supplies water in the Midlands.It has also warned a hosepipe ban is on the horizon due to unprecedented demand.Doug Clarke of Severn Trent said: Demand for water is massively up thanks to several weeks of extremely hot weather.While we have lots of water available and our reservoir levels are healthy and were putting millions of extra litres of water into the system, people are using water as fast as we can treat and pump it into supply.This is particularly the case during peak demand in the morning and evenings when we want to ask customers to restrict their supply so we can avoid areas of low pressure.Affinity Water, which supplies Hertfordshire, has posted advice on water usage on its website.It has asked customers to use a watering can in the garden, take shorter showers and turn off the tap when brushing teeth.Affinity Water said: We usually supply on average 900million litres of water each day to our 3.6million customers and we have had to significantly increase the amount we put into production to meet this demand. Our current average during this time is 1,200 million litres of water per day.“Although recent rainfall has been below average, the wet start to spring helped groundwater recover to near normal levels.It is unlikely that restrictions will be needed this year.Yorkshire Water offers a water saving pack and Kent supplier Southern Water says avoid non-essential chores.Ben Earl, water efficiency manager at Southern Water, said: “Our customers are already among the most water efficient in the country but there are simple things you can do to reduce waste - and cut your water bill.“In the heat wave, people should be neighbourly - preserve supplies by using water butts to water plants - brown lawns recover quickly.” South Staffs Water said reservoirs were healthy and Anglian Waters reservoir levels were where they should be or slightly above average.South West Waters total reservoir storage was 78.4%, compared to 74.3% at the same time last year.Northumbrian Water, Bristol Water and Thames Water all said they were not planning bans, while Wessex Water said there was no prospect of imposing the regions first hosepipe ban since 1976."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000359327049.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"karren brady switch off phone","story":"Remember the days when a mobile phone was like a hulking great brick? Available only to the elite few who could afford them at first, they were designed purely to enable people to take a call while away from home.Fast forward a couple of decades and we are all glued to our devices, a nation of addicts.We are now so wedded to our smartphones that we check them every 12 minutes.The average Brit spends more than a day a week online, twice as long as ten years ago.This surge in time online is largely down to the rise of smartphones, which are now used by 78 per cent of the population compared with just 17 per cent in 2008.My personal bugbear is people who walk along the street in a slow zig-zag because they are glued to their phone.And there’s nothing worse than someone who interrupts a conversation to take a call or read a text.It surely can’t be a coincidence that, in the same week as this report was released, we hear about five-year-olds starting school unable to speak in sentences — partly, no doubt, down to parents plugging them into a screen rather than talking or reading to them.I’ve got a Blackberry, mainly because I like the keyboard. But I am probably as hooked on it as the next person.It’s an invaluable tool for anyone wanting to work flexibly. But I also do a fair amount of pointless surfing on it.I’m not into all forms of social media, but I am a bit of a news junkie and I’ll confess I also watch the odd funny YouTube film with my kids.Unfortunately, progress in technology has brought the idea that we “should” all be available 24/7.In fact, people are quite indignant if you don’t reply to an email within the hour — even if it’s sent at 4am.Being a conscientious type, the result for me if I’m not careful, is that if I wake up in the night I’ll check my emails and maybe even reply to a few before going back to sleep. Now that can’t be good for the old circadian rhythms.The other problem with everyone being always available and always “on” is that our FOMO — fear of missing out — has increased exponentially.We’re all terrified that if we’re offline for too long we won’t get to . . . what exactly? See photos of someone’s hashtag perfect holibobs with the famalam — and then feel like our life is rubbish by comparison?I use Twitter a bit but I avoid Facebook and Instagram, partly because I don’t want the possibility that the opinions and “likes” of people I don’t know may influence me more than my own values and views.And another problem with the prevalence of tech is that we don’t have any down time.All those previously blank moments — on the bus, waiting for our microwave meal to cook, lying in bed at night — have all become an opportunity to surf, tweet, and message. We are going to burn out if we aren’t careful.I always know when I’m really relaxed because I accidentally go out without my phone.Granted, it generally only happens when I’m on holiday.But now I know how close we are to becoming actual addicts, I feel like we should all build in some time away from our devices.After all, the more time we spend looking at a screen, the less time we spend looking at the world and engaging with other people.So maybe we should all take a moment to leave our phone at home, go for a walk, and switch from “on” to “off”.Isn’t that a liberating thought?I’M sure a fair few people felt a bit guilty reading about the Vogue interview with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie this week.The sisters talk about how hard it is living in the public eye but also the criticism and mockery they face, often attacked for taking too many holidays.Who knows, perhaps some of that criticism is justified.But a lot of the comments they get are about their appearance and clothes – and that is where it crosses a line.No-one chooses the family into which they are born, and they are trying to make the best of the hand they’ve been given.They are trying to build careers and have a personal life while being in the public eye and that can’t be easy.I hope people realise that and give them a break.HAVING spent the past couple of decades getting annoyed at anyone who utters the words “Poor Jennifer Aniston”, this week, for the first time ever, I said them myself.You know why?Because the 49-year-old has been forced to publicly address, again, the tedious topic of why she hasn’t had a baby.She also alluded to something no woman should have to share with anyone they don’t want to, let alone the world – the fact she might be medically unable to procreate.Poor Jen. She can’t just get on with her very successful – and no doubt happy – life without being plagued by speculation.In the same interview she took the chance to spell it out: Just because she split from Justin Theroux doesn’t mean her life is over.She might even be happy to have finally got shot of him.“The misconceptions are ‘Jen can’t keep a man’,” she said. “And ‘Jen refuses to have a baby because she’s selfish and committed to her career.’ Or that I’m sad and heartbroken . . . first, with all due respect, I’m not heartbroken. And second, those are reckless assumptions.“No one knows what’s going on behind closed doors. No one considers how sensitive that might be for my partner and me. They don’t know what I’ve been through medically or emotionally.“There is a pressure on women to be mothers, and if they are not, then they’re deemed damaged goods. Maybe my purpose on this planet isn’t to procreate. Maybe I have other things I’m supposed to do.”So yes. Poor, poor Jen being under the world’s watchful and pitying eye all the time.Just to remind people. Jennifer Aniston is one of the world’s most successful stars.She has a big group of friends and a beautiful home, which she bought herself. She has dogs she adores, she’s funny, busy, and fulfilled.But all of that is worth nothing, of course. She doesn’t have kids.To anyone reading this who thinks women must have children to be fulfilled, please take note: Plenty of women don’t want to get married or have kids.Many other women want kids but can’t have them.And guess what? It’s none of our business.Here’s another way of looking at Jennifer’s life. She is lucky.She gets to please herself and hasn’t had to make any of the sacrifices that many of us make to become mothers.Also, George Clooney didn’t meet Amal until he was 51. Hugh Grant got married this year at 57 (after many failed relationships). Leonardo DiCaprio, 43, and Jude Law, 45, are still single and dating. Has anyone ever said: “Poor George/Hugh/Leonardo/Jude”?Of course they haven’t. So let’s stop saying it about Jennifer, too.I SO related to Carol Vorderman’s delight at being asked for proof of age when she bought some wine at M\u0026ampS recently.When you’re young, being asked to prove your age, as the presenter, above, was is very annoying. But as time goes by it’s one of life’s little victories.Having said that, this hasn’t happened to me in Aldi. Maybe I ought to go to M\u0026ampS!I’M truly appalled by the news that the Home Office “turns a blind eye” to the plight of British teenagers who are being forced to marry abroad, then raped and impregnated – after which the ministerial department actually hands a visa to their husbands.These young British women in question are forced abroad, or told they are going on holiday, but in reality are forced into a marriage and to get pregnant so that they can apply for a UK visa for their “husband”.Officials received dozens of reports last year that women wanted to block visas for men they had been made to marry in countries including Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and the United Arab Emirates.But in almost half of their cases the visas were approved nonetheless! And experts believe that there are thousands more victims who are too afraid to come forward.The women forced into this situation must be absolutely terrified, not least because their own family is complicit in this abuse.The authorities when granting the visa do not actually speak to the “wife”. There is no whistle-blowing process or opportunity for the women to make a confidential statement. Any statement made is public.Authorities fear that if they block the visa they will be called racists, but this is a safeguarding issue and that fear of causing offence really has to stop.We need to get on top of the problem by working with schools to raise awareness, so girls know how to report it.And we need to work with social workers so they can recognise the family members are the perpetrators of this crime.GOSH, how shocking is the video footage of a woman called Arabella Juniper Torres calling the police to report a woman, who happened to be black, for sheltering in her doorway in Brooklyn, New York, while waiting for her Uber?We are living in the age of the death of the Good Samaritan.I helped someone carry a pushchair downstairs at the Tube last week – as all the burly men walked past, I might add.She was so grateful it made me realise small acts of kindness have all but disappeared. How about this for an idea: let’s all try to be kind.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And how did they get so sick that they believe their behaviour is socially acceptable?These women-hating bullies — Liam Holmes, 20, who battered a woman to the ground outside Faces nightclub, and the five smirking thugs who tormented a vulnerable woman but can’t be named because they are under 18 — are not the products of brutal, inner-city gangland.These blights on the face of British manhood are the product of ordinary homes, God help us.They are what our young men look like now.They are not feral kids who never had a chance.They are not the products of deprived lives.The leering bullies posing proudly around their terrified victim in that sun-drenched park are growing up in Bury St Edmunds, a peaceful Suffolk market town with pretty cottages and a lovely cathedral, while Liam Holmes attacked his victim outside a club that was once a fashionable oasis for footballers and pop stars, the Essex answer to New York’s Studio 54.These thugs all have dear old mums who love them to bits.Indeed, the mother of one of the park scum sacks — a woman who must have an IQ lower than her dress size — complained that her son was the one suffering now because the backlash has ruined his 16th birthday.The poor little lamb! What’s the world coming to if you and your mates can’t torture a vulnerable middle-aged woman in the park any more?Personally, I hope the backlash ruins his life.And while we ponder these pitiful excuses for young men, let us spare a thought for their female victims.The 18-year-old woman who was punched to the ground by Liam Holmes has been predictably abused in the sewer of social media, informed “she deserved it” for daring to speak back to a man, and gloatingly told that, “she had a lesson in true equality.Meanwhile the vulnerable 49-year-old woman who was brutalised in the park has spoken with incredible restraint about her experience, which must have been as humiliating as it was frightening.“Considering the respective ages of all parties and that it was five or six young men versus me alone, I remain surprised that they behaved in such a way towards me,” she said.“I would like to hear their reasons, if possible.”Which is so mild-mannered that I find it breaks my bloody heart.It is tempting to blame the surge in violence against women on social media, and brainless morons like the little d**ks in that park taking pictures to show off to their mates. But it can’t all be blamed on social media.I bet Liam Holmes wishes there were no cameras around when he was smashing a woman in the jaw.“He wouldn’t do that for no reason,” protests his mother Cathy, 53. “There was a lot that went on before that people don’t know about.”Sorry, there can never be an excuse, reason or justification for a man or boy to abuse a woman or girl. Not ever.The old taboo about men being violent towards women should still stand.Lads, it doesn’t matter if they say something cutting to you at chucking out time.Lads, it doesn’t matter if they have the insolent cheek to sit on the park bench where you like to hang out with your bad-ass homies in the Bury St Edmunds massive.How hard is it to understand?Men should not be violent towards women.My father, the hardest man I ever met, taught me a real man does not raise his voice to a woman, let alone his hand.But that generation of tough, gentle men has gone and in their place we have pitiful excuses for the male of the species who feel empowered by belittling, beating and abusing women.And what sickens the stomach about the boys in the park is that they all look so very pleased with themselves, as if tormenting a vulnerable woman who, in the words of her stepmother “wouldn’t say boo to a goose” is the high point of their miserable lives.It is a good job their mothers all love them because I can’t imagine any other self-respecting woman ever will.“He’s never had a girlfriend,” someone remarked of woman-bashing lout, Liam Holmes.Yes, it shows. The big close-up Nicole posted on Instagram is absolutely terrifying. What a scary face! The spider, I mean. Not Nicole.HOW sweet life was for Jeremy Corbyn when he was a loopy left-wing backbencher, free to flutter his eyelashes at the IRA, to stand on platforms that compared Israel to Nazi Germany and to bowl up on Iranian TV praising the release of Hamas terrorists who had murdered Jewish children.But now fate has Corbyn as a possible Prime Minister his support of extremism is not such a good look.And no matter how pathetic this Tory Government becomes, no matter how timid, weak and gutless Theresa May looks in the face of Brussels’ bullying, the British people will never choose for Prime Minister a man who considers the child killers in Hamas to be his “brothers”.“In the past, in the pursuit of peace and justice for the Palestinian people, I have on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject,” apologises panicky Corbyn, a man who can feel the keys to 10 Downing Street slipping through his fingers.The past is coming back to haunt Jeremy Corbyn.And it will destroy him.It might also have something to do with the celeb fear of looking like a sweaty idiot with two left feet, while wearing nipple-crushing Lycra on prime-time television.Luckily, Nadiya Bychkova, above, will be there for her second series, the only pro dancer who looks more like a celebrity than any of the celebrities.THOSE who want the UK to remain in the European Union have never made any attempt to persuade the 17.4million who voted to leave to change our minds.They just insult us.Peter Mandelson says Brexiteers “hate other countries and hate foreigners” while Stewart Lee, a pot-bellied Bernard Manning for snowflakes, says: “It wasn’t just racists that voted to leave Europe – c**** did as well. Stupid f****** c****.”Just insults.Which is why Remain lost the referendum. And why they would lose 100 referendums.BAKE Off winner Nadiya Hussain tells Loose Women: “I work in an industry that is heavily dominated by male, middle-class, middle-aged men and there’s no space for a 5ft brown girl, who wears a headscarf.”But you became a national treasure, Nadiya.So self-pity is misplaced.MADONNA turns 60 years old on August 16 and has marked the birthday by laying provocatively on the ground sporting suspenders, lacy bra and a been-to-bed expression in her half-closed eyes.The Material Girl still looks great, of course.Mind you, she does look as though she might need a hand getting back on her feet. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Believing it was just a bit of harmless fun, Toni agreed.But she was unaware they dye was black henna - a chemical that can cause dangerous burns and in some cases permanent scarring. Her two sons suffered a severe reaction and which caused the designs to melt into their skin.Posting on Facebook to warn other parents, Toni said: “This is what black henna can do to your skin! We let our children have them on holiday not thinking for a second it would be dangerous.“The hospital have said that the chemicals/dyes in black henna are too strong. They now have chemical burns and are on antibiotics and antihistamines in the hope that they don’t get infection or get poorly. If you are offered it say NO!”Toni, of Colne, Lancs, added: “I’m gutted! Wouldn’t have gone near it if I’d have known. I just presumed it was harmless. Feel so bad, didn’t even know black henna was dangerous. There were loads of people offering it too. It makes me so mad how many people are doing it over there. The docs have said not to put anything on them, once it’s started to heal I’ll try something, maybe bio oil.”The post has been shared hundreds of times, with Carrice Dickinson commenting: “Oh my god that’s horrendous! Hope they make a speedy recovery poor boys.”Helen Feeney added: “That looks painful. It has the same chemicals in as hair dye only in much higher strengths. Lethal stuff so i hope they will be OK.” The family had been staying at the three-star all-inclusive Caribbean Village Agador in Morocco last month. It’s believed the henna tattoos were done nearby.The NHS warns against having them done while abroad, with their website saying: “If you see a shop or stall offering to paint black tattoos onto your skin, don’t be tempted to get one. It could leave you scarred for life and put you at risk of a life-threatening allergic reaction.“Often called “black henna” or “neutral henna” tattoos, these patterns painted onto your skin are readily available abroad. But the black paste used in these temporary tattoos may contain high levels of a chemical dye so powerful and toxic that it is illegal to use it on the skin in this way.”The risks of black henna lie in the paste’s ingredients – specifically a chemical called PPD.Dr Chris Flower, director general of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association, explains: “PPD is safely and legally used in permanent hair dyes where clear instructions are given, and where the maximum level is controlled by law. But black henna often contains PPD at high levels, to give a dark colour quickly.“When applied to the skin in the form of a black henna temporary tattoo, PPD can cause chemical burns and lead to allergic reactions.”Last month, mum Jade Morris, 26, of Oldbury, West Mids, revealed how her two children were scarred for life after getting henna tattoos done in Tunisia.

Despite widespread public revulsion with the habit elsewhere in the world, neither killing dogs to eat nor consuming their meat is illegal in Britain.A total ban on the import, trade and consumption of dog meat is about to be enacted across America by the US Congress next month after similar concerns about its increase there.The government is being urged to repeat the US ban here, and the move last night won the backing of a series of senior MPs. The World Dog Alliance will launch a nationwide campaign in the UK for a full ban on any interaction with dog meat in the Autumn.The WDA’s Kike Yuen told The Sun last night: “In the US, people who eat dog meat are mainly immigrants from Asia. With three million immigrants from East Asia in the UK, we cannot deny this situation exists here too”.Mr Yeun added: “We also believe legislation against dog meat in UK would provide us with strength to continue our work in Asia, as the UK could influence other countries to stop dog meat consumption. Most of them usually refused to do so with the excuse that there is no such law in Western countries”.It is still legal to kill dogs and eat them in the UK, as long as they are killed in a way that does not cause suffering. Though the practice has been taboo across much of Europe for a century, there is also no specific ban on buying or selling dog meat either.Dog lover and Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan last night dubbed a full ban “absolutely right”. Sir Alan, who owns a prize-winning cockapoo called Noodle, said: “There is no need in the modern world for this disgusting habit. We should nip it in the bud now to make sure the practice never takes off here. A civilised country is decent to animals, so let’s be fully decent here.”The chair of the All-party Parliamentary Dog Advisory Welfare Group Lisa Cameron MP added: “I very much support a ban on dog meat consumption in the UK, and urge the Government to look at this as a matter of urgency. We must be culturally sensitive, but I do not believe the general public would approve of the practice at all.”The SNP MP added: “Dogs are sentient beings and we value them very highly as pets. The last thing we want is dog farms here”.An estimated 30 million dogs a year are slaughtered to be eaten, across China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.In China, 20 per cent of the population still eat dog meat - some because of the superstitious belief that it is a health tonic - and the country accounts for half the annual slaughter.In South Korea, 60 per cent of people eat dog meat regularly, and 5 million dogs are slaughtered each year to feed their appetite. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs last night refused to comment.BRITAIN is a nation of dog-lovers.Our four-legged friends heroically work alongside our police, fire services and armed forces.They assist the disabled. And they provide unconditional love for millions.Now, leading dog charities have warned that the consumption of dog meat here is on the rise.This sick trend cannot continue.Campaigners are calling on the Government to outlaw it.But it is horrifying that this is not already the case.America will enact legislation next month to make it illegal there.Our Government must do the same.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It also emerged that boys and girls are especially influenced by their relationship with the opposite sex parent.Sir Paul Coleridge, chairman of Marriage Foundation, said: “Mummy’s boys and daddy’s girls have been known about for generations as something of a stereotypical joke. But girls and boys, as they develop, do indeed have differing emotional needs and expectations and do best when these needs are satisfied.“A strong relationship with the parent of the opposite sex boosts self-esteem and peer group relationship skills both of which support sound mental health.Overall, teenagers are much more likely to be close to their mother than their father.A total of 81% of girls were found to be ‘very’ or ‘extremely close’ to their others, while only 59% were the same with their fathers.

Now, like the “F-word”, it has become the reach-for term of abuse applied to any debate — including the issue of Britain leaving the European Union.Opposition to the EU’s ­corrupt and undemocratic “Grand Projet” long precedes the uncontrolled mass immigration unleashed by Labour.Illegal immigration is simply another symptom of EU “we know best” arrogance — personified by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Yet preposterous Tory MP Anna “Suck-It-Up” Soubry routinely slurs 17.4million referendum voters as “racist”.It is the mantra of all those who see Brexit voters — more than half the country — as thick and nasty.Odious Peter Mandelson joined in last week, avoiding the “R-word” but ludicrously accusing anyone who wants to leave the EU of “hating foreigners”, which is the same thing.“Nationalism is a hatred of foreigners,” says the slippery Euro peer. “They should not be confused with patriots.”“I voted Remain in the referendum though I entirely respect the contrary view of many others.”Mandy’s relationship with the truth has always been flaky, but this is pure cant.Even those who once worked alongside Lord Mandelson when Labour still stood for something are appalled.Ex-Home Secretary and fellow Remainer David Blunkett snapped yesterday: “The allegation that some of those voting for Leave were ‘racist’ is not a new one.“It has been bandied about and seems to me not only an insult to the many people that I used to represent who voted Leave, but also to utterly miss the point of why the majority of British people voted the way they did.“If we fail to understand, then we do ourselves, but crucially also our democracy, a great disservice.”Lord Blunkett also slammed Mandy’s call for a second referendum.He is right. It is now clear the mood has hardened against bullying Brussels.The EU’s own snide insinuations that voters here are racist “Little Englanders” has not helped.Bank of England boss Mark Carney, architect of Project Fear, sank the Pound last week by claiming chances of a clean-break Brexit were “uncomfortably high”.Trade Secretary Liam Fox warns the odds are now 60-40 against a deal.Remainers should understand that every gratuitous insult to the intelligence of decent British voters is another nail in Theresa May’s chances of a friendly ­negotiated settlement.McDonnell, cleverer than Corbyn, wants to stop Labour being dragged into what deputy leader Tom Watson calls a “vortex of eternal shame”. But McDonnell, too, is stained by anti-Jewish sentiment.In any case, Britain needs Jeremy Corbyn – to remain in place as the sullen figurehead of a blinkered Marxist rabble and remind voters what they are risking at the next election.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Three women who are believed to be the children’s mothers were detained and released.Wahhaj was collared on an outstanding arrest warrant from Georgia alleging child abduction. He was found inside the compound with an AR-15 rifle, five 30-round magazines and four loaded pistols.Police arrested Morten on suspicion he was harboring a fugitive, officials said.The children were turned over to state child-welfare workers.“The children are in our custody, and our No. 1 priority right now is their health and safety,” said New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department Secretary Monique Jacobson in a statement.“We will continue to work closely with law enforcement on this investigation.”A version of this story originally appeared on The New York Post. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yes it is its largest military player. Yes we are a cultural powerhouse. Yes we are their biggest individual market. Britain is powerful - but the EU is more powerful than we are.On paper - this should not be surprising, yet no politician, of any stripe, would ever dare say it.But the facts speak for themselves: We are 65 million of a bloc of 450 million. Ours is a $2.9trn (\u0026#1632.2trn) economy, they are $19trn (\u0026#16314.6trn) They represent 44% of our exports. We, just 9% of theirs. They are 27 - we are one.The impact of a no deal (as all the studies show) would be considerable but they have a crucial advantage: they are able to spread the risk and burden. For that reason, the same studies show, it would hurt us far more. We have nowhere else to turn.This should not be surprising. Imagine another country taking Britain\u0027s place - that we had \u0027Frexit\u0027 or \u0027Nexit\u0027 or \u0027Spexit\u0027 or even \u0027Deutschexit\u0027, ask yourself where the power would lie. It would be with the remaining states of the union.That we struggle to come to terms with that is, I think, deeply revealing of the British psyche.This imbalance was obscured through years of membership - we had no need to confront our own relative weakness as a member of the club - but now we are outside, that asymmetry of power is exposed for all to see.That is why we have accepted concession after concession, not because of Theresa May\u0027s pusillanimity but because of the hard truths of realpolitik.That is why Mrs May and her ministers have been conducting a grand tour of Europe. Not because they want yet more sea bass and asparagus in yet another state dinner, but because they recognise how powerful they are as a bloc and how isolated we are in their face.They want to tear them asunder, to divide and conquer - this is what David Davis said would happen during the referendum. Yet, they have remained, in 18 months a united set of two, while our own house, our own government, has been fatally divided.Time and again throughout our history, Britain has acted to prevent the emergence of a hegemonic power which controlled all of Europe, aware that Britain, even with an empire, could not resist a united continent\u0027s gravitational pull. Today\u0027s crop of politicians, seem to have forgotten that lesson. Looked at through the psychology of the British public\u0027s collective psyche, we can see Mrs May as the Wizard of Oz - less powerful than her people think, or than our population would like others to believe.That is what is invidious about Brexit for British politicians - for the British public to accept Chequers, or something like it, would essentially be to ask the British people to accept a downgrade of their own view of British power, a downgrade of the sort of country we think we should be and that we think we are.We are not an especially jingoistic nation, but that is much to stomach. It is a view which, however unfair, would be repeated and churned by the exact Brexiteers who, from Mrs May\u0027s point of view, forced us to accept the downgrade in the first place."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-brexit-fox_4381580.jpg?20180805182151 ","title":"liam fox faces ridicule over u turn on brexit no deal","story":"So what has changed? A lot, actually. The Chequers deal has bombed with Tory MPs and activists, including members of the PM\u0027s own association in Maidenhead.Two senior cabinet ministers, David Davis and Boris Johnson, have resigned, with Mr Davis\u0027s former lieutenants Steve Baker and Stewart Jackson now acting as pro-Brexit attack dogs.Mr Johnson, meanwhile, is now firmly re-installed as the darling of the Tory grassroots and the hot favourite with the activists to replace Mrs May as party leader and prime minister.Then there has been the reaction to the Chequers deal from Michel Barnier, accused by Dr Fox in his Sunday Times interview of \"intransigence\" and of making no deal more likely. In his lofty, patrician manner and with customary \"hauteur\", Mr Barnier picked the Chequers plan apart clause by clause, to the extent that even its biggest fans fear it is now mort dans l\u0027eau.And that\u0027s one reason why Theresa May was probably wasting her time when she went to the French president\u0027s Riviera retreat and told him Brussels faces a choice between the Chequers deal and no deal.When I went to Strasbourg for Emmanuel Macron\u0027s address to the European Parliament in April, I was told by senior MEPs that the president and Mr Barnier are extremely close politically.As a result, President Macron - probably the EU\u0027s chief powerbroker now that Angela Merkel\u0027s authority is waning - will ensure that his \"uncle\" succeeds Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission next year.No wonder President Macron told Mrs May at Napoleon\u0027s stronghold of Fort Bregancon that he was not willing to break the Brexit deadlock by breaking ranks with the EU\u0027s negotiators.\"There is absolutely no intention to speak in place of Monsieur Barnier,\" a French diplomat was reported to have said, confirming the president\u0027s close alignment with Mr Barnier.And so in spite of Mrs May\u0027s Riviera charm offensive, there has at the same time been a significant change in tone in the government\u0027s Brexit language in recent weeks, as the Chequers plan has faced derision and rejection. First there has been what Brexiteers claim has been a return of \"project fear\" scare stories, about stockpiling of food and medicines, lorry gridlock at Dover, long queues at border control and customs and fees for travel visas.But the biggest change in tone has come in the Foreign Office, where Boris Johnson\u0027s clown-like bluster and looseness with facts and detail have been replaced by the more thoughtful approach of Jeremy Hunt.Instead of Mr Johnson\u0027s gung-ho and cavalier approach to Brexit, former Remainer Mr Hunt has been deadly serious in his warnings of the risk of \"no deal by accident\" increasing by the day.Then last week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney - denounced as \"the high priest of Project Fear\" by Jacob Rees-Mogg - said the risk of no deal was \"uncomfortably high and highly undesirable\".Are all these dire warnings aimed at putting pressure on Brussels to sign up to a deal? Almost certainly. Will they work? Probably not. But then some hardline Brexiteers on the Tory backbenches have always favoured no deal.The danger for the prime minister, however, is that the more no deal looks likely the louder the calls from pro-Remain MPs and campaigners for a second referendum - a so-called \"people\u0027s vote\" - will become."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-weather-brighton_4380260.jpg?20180804130047 ","title":"make the most of it before heatwave cools off","story":"But the heatwave is set to end come Wednesday when temperatures are likely to dip to around the mid-20Cs mark.Met Office meteorologist Dean Hall said there will be \"quite a marked change to the feel of things\" when conditions turn \"fresher and more changeable\".He added that is likely to stay cooler throughout next weekend, with \"no real sign of any return of the heat that we have been seeing over the recent days\".British holidaymakers abroad have been warned to avoid spending time in the sun during the hottest part of the day and to keep hydrated as temperatures remain especially high in some European countries.Last week, records were smashed in eight areas of Portugal, while Lisbon broke a 37-year-old record with the thermometers reaching 44C (111.2F) on Sunday.Red health alerts for extreme heat have been issued for more than half the country, with thermometers passing 46C (114.8F) over the weekend.The hot, dry conditions have led to several Portuguese wildfires."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-newspapers-paper_4381683.jpg?20180805220340 ","title":"starving children are found on us compound","story":"Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe, from Taos County, described the children as being kept in the \"saddest living conditions I\u0027ve ever seen\".He added: \"The only food we saw were a few potatoes and a box of rice in the filthy trailer.\"But what was most surprising, and heartbreaking, was when the team located a total of five adults and 11 children that looked like third world country refugees not only with no food or fresh water, but with no shoes, personal hygiene and basically dirty rags for clothing.\"They were turned over to state child welfare workers for their own health and safety, police said.

But there is a key question at the heart of the EU side\u0027s thinking on Brexit. Don\u0027t forget they deeply regret Britain\u0027s departure and are aware it presents dangers, whatever happens.The question is this: what\u0027s the best or the least bad Brexit for the EU\u0027s medium and long term interests?Is it to give the UK a good deal - thus breaking principles of the EU, allowing Britain free movement of goods but not people unique bespoke deal, as outlined in Chequers?

Earlier this year former leader Henry Bolton said the party had been losing 1,000 members per month.\"It\u0027s obvious to the British public now that Mrs May is betraying Brexit and she\u0027s going to go on doing that, and that is causing immense anger in the population and a lot of people are joining us because of that,\" Gerard Batten told Sky News.However, the UKIP leader also claimed some of the increase in membership had come as a result of recent support the party has received from social media figures that have significant followings among the so-called \"alt-right\".He said: \"We\u0027ve taken on-board some people from the alternative media realm, who joined us by the way, I didn\u0027t invite them.\"They came on board because they like what we\u0027re saying, they like the things we represent, and that opens us up to a much much wider audience than we had before particularly amongst younger people.\" Mr Batten said that the social media figures who have joined the party would be bound by the same rules as other UKIP members, and would not be given any special treatment if they were to seen to make comments that might bring the party into disrepute.He also denied his own anti-Islam views and backing for former-EDL leader Tommy Robinson - who is barred from joining UKIP due to a previous affiliation with the BNP - would alienate more mainstream eurosceptics.He said: \"Those people have got an awful lot of things in common. They are the ordinary working people in this country that pay tax and the small business owners - there are a forgotten group in our country.\"I don\u0027t think the fact Tommy Robinson may have had a youthful indiscretion and joined the BNP cuts much ice with those people, they care about what he\u0027s talking about.\"Under the recent leadership of Henry Bolton, party membership is understood to have slumped to around 18,000. The current level is thought to be near 23,000 but a senior party source said another goal of the strategy meetings with alt-right figures was to raise UKIP\u0027s membership above its previous high of around 45,000 in early 2016.Speaking to Sky News in Grays, Mr Aker accused Mr Batten of blurring the distinction between concerns over immigration and his anti-islam stance.He said: \"The two things are completely different. Under Farage, when UKIP were riding high, the talk was about the Australian points based system - people want controlled immigration.\"Look around, Thurrock is a very mixed very diverse community - how could UKIP do well here?\"Because everyone here drives on congested roads, has to wait longer for GP appointments, and sees council house waiting list soaring by the week - now that\u0027s not pointing fingers at any one community, it\u0027s saying the numbers of people coming into this country are too high and we need to control that and the only way we can control that is by leaving the European Union that\u0027s the message that UKIP should be talking about.\"In the general election of 2015 UKIP received the third largest share of the vote across the country, although that only gave the party a single MP.In 2017 the party received just 1.8% of the national vote, and has lost the vast majority of its councillors in recent local elections.:: UKIP new membership enrolments since July 6 2018::: In the UK"},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-nicolas-maduro-caracas_4381010.jpg?20180805003950 ","title":"us denies role in assassination attempt on venezuelan president nicolas maduro","story":"Earlier, US national security adviser John Bolton felt the need to deny any involvement on the part of the White House.\"There is no US involvement in this at all,\" he told Fox News.\u0027\u0027If the government of Venezuela has hard information that they want to present to us that would show a potential violation of US criminal law, we\u0027ll take a serious look at it.\"Earlier, Mr Maduro called on the Trump administration to \"fight\" the \"terrorist groups\" he believed had targeted him.

Dad David, 32, said: “My whole world went dark. “We’d had no complications so to suddenly be faced with the prospect that our son might not live was too much to comprehend.”  Archie is now eight months old and David and wife Emma, of Whitehaven, Cumbria, are raising money for The Sick Children’s Trust. The charity accommodated the family near the Newcastle hospital where their son was being treated. He said: “Having that private room as a base to come back to every evening was a godsend.” The previous youngest stroke victim in the UK was 19-month-old Ronnie Kerman, from Hull.

Bride Daisy wore a flower-embellished wedding dress for the 3.30pm service at St Mary the Virgin church in Frensham, Surrey.  And the bridal bouquet for the party and wedding videographer, of course, had to include her namesake flowers. On one of the hottest days of the year the guests were all smiles as they waited outside the church in the glorious sunshine. There was no page boys on hand to help the bride with her veil or train but she did have a troupe of young bridesmaids to offer their services should they be required.  After the ceremony, which lasted roughly 45 minutes, Charlie performed his first duty as a newlywed husband - cycling his bride off to the reception in a tricycle. Daisy, who arrived in a black 1951 Mk6 Bentley just before 3.30pm, chose the church, which was consecrated in 1239, as it was where her parents Phillip and Dixie got married and also where she was baptised. Revd Jane Walker, who led the service, said: “It was a wonderful occasion and Charlie and Daisy looked spectacularly happy. It was a great occasion.” Bride Daisy kicked off her career in 2010 when she was hired to film a wedding in Port Isaac. She is said to have gone full-time in 2011 and now has clients in Europe as well as the UK. The groom had been usher at the Duke and Duchess\u0027 wedding in Windsor in May and paid Harry the ultimate compliment by choosing him to be best man for the nuptials today. The royal connections for the happy couple run deep with his older brother Thomas being good friends with the Duke of Cambridge and also godfather to Princess Charlotte. A third Van Straubenzee brother died in 2002 aged 18 with both princes attending the funeral.

The Duchess of Sussex is travelling to the US soon and will visit friends and family in New York and LA. Meghan, 37, has personally instructed palace aides to make contact with Thomas Markle, 74, after almost three months of not speaking to him. A source said: “A face-to-face meeting could be what is needed to help Meghan and her dad get their relationship on track. “Both Meghan and Prince Harry have been deeply hurt over the continued comments coming from her father and the manner in which he is conducting himself.” It emerged today that Meghan has instructed palace aides to “reach out” to her troubled dad to arrange a meeting between them.    She has decided the time is right to make contact with her father again after almost three months of not speaking to him. The pair suffered a complete breakdown in their relationship after Thomas, 74, took part in a series of interviews where he divulged details of private conversations with Prince Harry and his daughter. He also observed how he believed Meghan is “terrified” in her new role as a duchess and that Harry’s mum Diana would have “loathed” the way he is being frozen out by the Royal Family. The summit could pave the way to clear the air between the Duchess, who turned 37 on Saturday, and her dad after he claimed he would be better off dead because “everyone would be filled with sympathy for her”. The Mirror last week revealed how three courses of action had been put to the Duchess after a series of meetings were scheduled to discuss the ongoing problems between Meghan and her dad.  Firstly, Meghan could contact her father and appeal to him directly to ask him to stop talking about her in public, secondly the possibility of an intermediary making contact to appeal to him to stop making such hurtful statements about her. The final option would be for Meghan to cut him off completely in the hope he will stop. However, palace staff fear Meghan speaking directly to Thomas because of his propensity to carry out “tell-all” interviews in recent weeks, with seemingly nothing being off limits. Thomas even said he wouldn’t be silenced despite revealing how Meghan, who he affectionately calls ‘Bean’, was upset that he had discussed her wish to have a child in the near future.

Sarah Lamont , 32, is a restaurant supervisor who lives in Kinross, Scotland, with husband Dale, 34, a site manager, and their daughters Ellie, 10, and five-year-old Holly.  Here she explains in her words why her children are rarely sick: I don’t own a dishcloth. They are absolutely full of germs, so why on earth would I spread one around my house? I spray my surfaces with Zoflora antibacterial spray which kills 99.9% of bacteria and viruses, then wipe them with kitchen paper, which is then binned. All my dishes and pots and pans are put in the dishwasher at a cycle which washes them at a 90 degree temperature to really blitz any dirt. We all wash our hands with Carex antibacterial soap before we eat anything, even a little snack. And I put little bottles of hand sanitiser in my girls’ pockets so they’re always clean. At meal times, like all young kids, my girls drop bits of food – once it’s hit the floor, it’s whisked straight into the bin. Sometimes that causes a tantrum, but I’d rather deal with that than illness.  My laundry basket’s rarely empty because even if clothes have been worn for an hour and get dirty, they’re bunged in the wash. And since Ellie and Holly are always playing outside, that means doing three or four loads a day. But at least I know they’re as clean as can be. I’d never dream of hanging anything up in the wardrobe that wasn’t freshly laundered. Even my girls’ pyjamas are washed every morning because I like to know they have a clean pair each night, although I remember having fresh nightwear only every three or four nights as a child. All our bedding is washed every Friday and our towels every second day. It isn’t enough just to have washing detergent and softener in the machine, so I also add a laundry cleaner to kill any bacteria. Once a month I use a washing machine cleaner on a high temperature to keep my machine germ-free. And although I know I wasn’t showered every night as a child, Ellie and Holly have a shower and hair wash every evening. The bathrooms are scrubbed every night. Our labrador Roxy also creates a lot more housework as I vacuum and wash the dog’s blankets every day. I did a lot of research before we adopted Roxy, and found that having a dog in the home is good for strengthening children’s immune systems. So do I think our kids are too clean? There seem to be more sickness bugs than I ever remember as a child, but Ellie and Holly are rarely sick – so I must be doing something right.  What Sarah\u0027s mum says:  Sarah’s mum June Murray , 55, is a restaurant supervisor and lives with her husband Raymond in Kinross. She also has a younger daughter Gillian, 28.  Hygiene around kids has changed an awful lot since I brought up my girls. I recently thought about buying my granddaughters Ellie and Holly a pyjama case, then realised they only ever put their nighties in the washing bin so a pyjama case would be completely redundant. And when I gave Sarah and Dale really nice tea towels for their first wedding anniversary, Sarah looked at them and said, ‘What do I do with these?’ She puts everything in the dishwasher so has no need of them. I still have dishcloths but wash them every night and I don’t see anything wrong with that. But whenever Sarah’s at my house and sees my cloths, she rolls her eyes a lot. When I was a young mum, I washed my daughters’ hair once or twice a week – we didn’t know any kids who had theirs washed every night like Ellie and Holly. And if my girls dropped something like a whole biscuit from the table, I swooped down to pick it up and popped it back on the table so they could eat it.

The mercury is set to rocket past 30C (85F) in parts of the UK today, with 33C possible in London and to the east of the capital as the working week kicks off. And temperatures could edge a degree higher on Tuesday, potentially peaking at 34C (91.4F) in Essex or Norfolk, the Met Office said. It follows a balmy weekend, with hundreds of sun-lovers flocking to beaches along the south coast and partying at Brighton\u0027s annual Pride event. The hottest temperature on Sunday was 30.2C (86.36F) recorded in Northolt, greater London. However, not all of the UK will be gazing into clear blue skies - much of Scotland and Northern Ireland will start the week with some rain.  England and Wales are to stay generally dry and warmer, with the exception of possible thunderstorms across the south east on Tuesday. The mercury will need to climb significantly if it is to come close to England\u0027s current August record - 38.5C (101.3F) reached in Faversham, Kent, in 2003. However, maximum temperatures are likely to dip to around the mid-20Cs mark come Wednesday.  Forecaster Dean Hall said there will be quite a marked change to the feel of things from the middle of the week as conditions turn fresher and more changeable. It is likely to stay cooler throughout next weekend, he said, with no real sign of any return of the heat that we have been seeing over the recent days. It comes amid a sweltering European heatwave, with holidaymakers in Portugal and Spain feeling the brunt of the sun.  The mercury is being driven higher by a hot air mass moving north from Africa, bringing dust from the Sahara Desert. British holidaymakers abroad are being warned to avoid spending time in the sun during the hottest part of the day and to keep hydrated. Last week local records were smashed in eight areas of Portugal, while Lisbon broke a 37-year-old record with the thermometers reaching 44C (111.2F) on Sunday.  Red health alerts for extreme heat have been issued for more than half the country, with thermometers passing 46C (114.8F) over the weekend. The hot, dry conditions led to several Portuguese wildfires. In Spain, heat warnings were issued for 41 of the country\u0027s 50 provinces. The stifling conditions played a part in the deaths of two men, one in Barcelona and the other in the southern Spanish region of Murcia, according to Spanish authorities.

But don’t panic sun-seekers - forecasters are predicting the sweltering summer of 2018 could last until October. The Met Office has told baking Britons to prepare for an Indian summer that could break previous records. Temperatures are due to soar as high as 33C tomorrow and Tuesday making the UK hotter than the Maldives. It is thanks to a plume of hot air from the continent and continuing high pressure over most of Western Europe. The same weather system brought record 46C heat to parts of Portugal and Spain over the weekend.  El Grenado in Spain recorded the highest temperature of 46.6C on Saturday afternoon. It fell short of Europe’s hottest ever temperature of 48C, which was set in Athens, Greece, in August 1977. Things are to cool down later this week - with thunderstorms predicted for parts of the south by Tuesday. Some areas will a 10C drop in temperatures, with Carlisle struggling to reach 16C by Friday. Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said: “It’s certainly been a true hot spell in Spain and Portugal.  “We’ll tap into some of that very hot air across the continent on Monday and Tuesday. “But thunderstorms are a risk on Tuesday and into Wednesday in the South. “There is the potential for travel disruption from torrential downpours, lightning, hail and gusty winds, with fresher temperatures following.” Forecasters say it will only be a temporary blip and are predicting more hot weather in the latter part of August. The Met Office says the UK is much more likely to see hotter than normal temperatures until October. July’s average UK maximum temperature was 22.5C, hotter than the summer of 1976, which recorded an average of 21.6C.  Sun-seekers made the most of the weather by heading to British seaside resorts over the weekend. More than 400,000 visitors flocked to Brighton, where the annual Pride festival was taking place. A further 200,000 tourists travelled to Bournemouth and 175,000 in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Our record-breaking summer has helped seaside resorts pocket bumper profits. Bournemouth has already hit its annual income target for beachfront attractions four months early. Hotels and restaurants in the UK’s top beach resort are enjoying as much as a 40% upturn in trade.  One hotelier said guests have even started to reserve sunbeds by getting up early to put their towels down like in Spanish hotels. It is estimated that 100,000 people are currently visiting Bournemouth every weekend. But not everyone is enjoying the hot weather, with Britain’s islanders facing a water crisis. The heatwave has caused a water shortage headache for islands from the Isles of Scilly to the Outer Hebrides. In the Isles of Scilly the council has urged people to reduce their water consumption and drawn up emergency plans for rationing. It fears freshwater boreholes are so depleted that they face inundation by seawater, leaving them unusable for years.

The Hungarian carrier\u0027s UK departures were an average of 23 minutes late in 2017, according to Press Association analysis of Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) data. Norwegian Air Shuttle has the second worst performance, followed by Vueling Airlines, Thomas Cook Airlines and BMI Regional. The ranking features the 44 airlines with at least 2,000 scheduled flights from UK airports last year. Average delay figures take into account every flight that operated, including those that were on time. Cancelled services are excluded from the CAA data. Scandinavian Airlines is the most punctual, with aircraft typically taking off just seven minutes behind schedule. Aer Lingus has the second best record, followed by Air France, Alitalia and Delta Airlines. The average delay across all flights was 15 minutes.  A spokeswoman for Wizz Air said: A number of issues specific to the UK, including airport infrastructure, airspace congestion and slot restrictions contribute to a significantly worse on-time performance of our UK routes compared to the rest of our network. She noted that disruption was caused by particularly severe winter weather last year and added that the airline is taking measures to improve its punctuality, such as basing eight aircraft in the UK to reduce its exposure to inbound delays. Norwegian Air Shuttle\u0027s UK flights mainly consist of short-haul services from London Gatwick, Manchester and Edinburgh. Its average delay of 22 minutes does not take into account the majority of Norwegian\u0027s long-haul flights from UK airports, which are operated by a British subsidiary. A Norwegian spokesman said frequent air traffic control (ATC) strikes across Europe and adverse weather invariably impact punctuality and are beyond the control of airlines. He went on: We do everything possible to ensure that flights operate to allow passengers to reach their destination as soon as possible.  Norwegian is committed to keep improving punctuality, and where factors are within our direct control we have introduced new measures to continue delivering a smooth, efficient experience for our passengers. The CAA said punctuality clearly matters to airline passengers and it publishes the performance of carriers to allow people to make informed choices about which airline to fly with. Dale Keller, chief executive of airline association BAR UK, said delays are extremely costly to carriers. He added that airlines are fully engaged with governments, ATC providers and airports to minimise the causes of disruption which are outside their own control. Passengers on delayed flights from UK airports are entitled to assistance and compensation depending on the cause and length of the disruption. When flights are delayed for more than two hours, airlines have to provide free access to phone calls or emails, meals and refreshments, as well as hotel accommodation if an overnight stay is required.

She was disgusted after she was sent the word \u0027n****\u0027 to use - though the company claims it was \u0027auto generated\u0027.

The trio from California, USA, insist jealousy is not an issue between them - and their families all approve of their relationship. They even each have tattoos representing their love for each other, one being a triangle to represent their three way love.   Lindsay told The Sun : “Human beings are capable of so much love and now that we are together it seems so stifling to only have those feelings for one person at a time.   It started as a love between the three of us and that it what it will always be.  We have talked about having kids- we have seen plenty of triads successfully raise families together and it\u0027s beautiful.”  They\u0027ve all known each other for 12 years but have been romantically involved for three.

And then there\u0027s the next level make-up pros, the ones that can wield a foundation brush like a magic wand, sculpt their brows into weapons and contour like a boss.  One woman has reached new make-up heights, completely transforming her face in a video which has gone viral after being shared on the 9GAG Facebook page.   China\u0027s Qi Huahua was unrecognisable at the end of the video after using sculpture make-up to change her look - including adding a prosthetic nose. The video was captioned how to get away with murder and it begins by showing Qi lightening her skin with a white cream, before applying foundation and stamping on thick, dark brows. After this, the talented lady applies eyeshadow and false lashes before putting a light powder on her inner eye to make them it look larger.  She then contours her face, slims her jaw by taping down her chin and smears red paint onto her lips and cheeks. To complete the look, she adds prosthetic make-up to her nose and covers her chest and arms with more of the white cream as a light skin tone is considered very desirable by some people in China. After transforming herself, Qi films herself removing all the makeup to prove it really is her.

There were scenes of chaos and destruction across Lombok, the epicentre, after the magnitude 6.9 earthquake caused buildings to sway and huge chunks of debris to rain down as terrified people ran into the streets. A one-year-old child was among the dead, and there are fears the death toll will rise again. Large parts of Lombok were left without electricity and communications as a tsunami warning was briefly triggered, the military sent medical aid and supplies, and fleeing tourists cut short their holidays. Thousands of buildings collapsed or were badly damaged, and the scale of the devastation became clear after sunrise on Monday. Are you in Bali or Lombok? Let us know what you experienced by emailing webnews@trinitymirror. Bali earthquake: Devastation left behind after 6.9-magnitude tremor kills dozens Most of the dead were on Lombok where the quake hit Sunday evening, a week after a magnitude 6.4 tremor killed 17 people, injured hundreds and briefly stranded several hundred hikers on the slopes of a volcano. Rosiady Sayuti, secretary to the West Nusa Tenggara provincial administration, told Indonesia\u0027s  TV that 142 people were dead. Officials had earlier put the death toll at 91, already making it the second-deadliest quake of 2018 and one of the strongest. The quake was so powerful that it rocked the neighbouring island of Bali, where at least two people died. About 1,000 foreign and domestic tourists were evacuated in boats from the three Gili islands off the north-west coast of Lombok.  Indonesia\u0027s Red Cross said it had helped a woman give birth after the quake at a health post in Lombok. One of the names she gave the baby boy was \u0027Gempa\u0027, which means \u0027earthquake\u0027.  Agung Pramuja, head of the Disaster Mitigation Agency in the West Nusa Tenggara province which includes Lombok andneighbouring islands but not Bali, said many of the dead were from northern and western parts of Lombok. More than 120 aftershocks were recorded after Sunday evening\u0027s quake, which was initially measured at a magnitude of seven but was later revised to 6.9. Cally Charles, from Devon, said that her partner Ashley Knight, 23, proposed to hear on a Bali beach just moments before the quake hit.  The romance quickly turned to terror as the disaster unfolded. The couple were in a lift at their hotel in the coastal resort of Jimbaran when the quake struck, and Cally described it as the scariest moment of my life. But reflecting back on what happened, the 23-year-old quipped: Five minutes before the earthquake my boyfriend proposed on the beach. He’s one of a kind he made the earth move for me.  She said: The whole lift was shaking. We got to the top level of our hotel (rooftop bar) people were holding onto tables and chairs. We ran down the stairs to the lobby where loads of people were stood outside. It was the scariest moment of my life. Singapore Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam, who was in the Lombok town of Mataram at the time of the quake, wrote on Facebook that his 10th-floor hotel room shook violently and walls cracked. He wrote: It was quite impossible to stand up. Heard screams. Came out, and made my way down a staircase, whilebuilding was still shaking. Power went out for a while. Lots of cracks, fallen doors.  Model Christine Teigen, who is in Bali with husband John Legend, posted on Twitter in the aftermath of the tremor: Bali. Trembling. So long. She had moments earlier written: MASSIVE earthquake. And her tweets continued: Oh man. We are on stilts. It felt like a ride. 15 solid seconds of \u0027hooooooly s*** this is happening\u0027. Take That star Gary Barlow was also on the island, posting on Twitter: Thank you for your concern - we\u0027re all fine - a bit shaken up.

Australia\u0027s Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton was on the 12th floor of a Lombok hotel at the time of the quake. He told Australian radio: We were knocked certainly to the floor. We were pretty lucky to get out. Everyone\u0027s a bit shaken but all well.  On Monday, long lines formed at the airport of Lombok\u0027s main town, Mataram, as foreign visitors cut their holidays short. Tourists pulled their suitcases past damaged homes and shops as they began their journeys home. Dutch tourist Marc Ganbuwalba injured his knee as a stampede of diners rushed from a restaurant after the quake. The 26-year-old, sitting on a trolley with his leg bandaged, said at the airport: We are cutting short our holiday because I can\u0027t walk and we\u0027re just not in the mood anymore, more in the mood to see our loved ones. We are just thankful to god and also to the hotel staff who really helped us. Some of them said their own houses had been destroyed but they were still helping us.

I still remember that we went to see Django Unchained that night,” said Daniel.Becky, 26, said: “From then on we were together and things blossomed.”On July 6, after months of planning, admittedly mostly by Becky, the big day finally arrived, bringing with it the sunshine.Becky said: “The weather was absolutely gorgeous.“We had already planned an indoor area in case the weather wasn’t great, but it was amazing.“Luckily the actual ceremony was in a shaded area so I wasn’t too hot in my dress.“I was roasting when I was getting ready though, as the sun was beaming through the window of the bridal suite.“Getting ready with my bridesmaids Catherine Payne, Emily Payne, Vicky Carter, Reagan Crawford and Arlene Cumming was probably one of my favourite parts of the day.”Although the bride wasn’t feeling the heat, the groom certainly was in more ways than one.“I was roasting in my kilt,” saiud Daniel. “My favourite part of the day was seeing Becky walk down the aisle, though I did cry.“I was fine until I saw Becky’s sister Catherine and my bottom lip started to wobble but when I saw Becky and her dad Ronald come down that was it, I was away.”Daniel was supported by best man Sam Mailer and ushers Josh Payne, Garry Brock and Michael Crawford, but it was humanist Lesley Anderson – and a couple of glasses of bubbly – that helped settle his nerves before his vows and the greatly anticipated speech.He said: “Lesley was amazing. I don’t know how much she chatted to Becky before the wedding but she really helped me settle my nerves.“Everyone has been saying how fantastic the ceremony was.“I was a bit nervous before my speech but a few glasses of Prosecco helped that.“I loved my speech. I thought it was really funny, although Becky doesn’t remember much of it.”Becky added: “The whole day is just a bit of a blur, not just the speech.”At the evening reception the newlyweds swayed across the dance floor to Tom Odell’s hit Grow Old With Me before the party was in full swing thanks to the band Sneaky Treacle.The couple would like to thank them and photographers Burfly Photography, as well as their parents who helped with the planning.Becky added: “Organising the wedding was quite stressful but it was all worthwhile in the end.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b642080eb763-409x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united in safe hands for the rigours ahead says siegrist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United fans will find out today which of their new goalkeepers has won the battle to start the league season between the sticks.And one of the men involved, Benjamin Siegrist, is happy to let them know in advance that whoever gets the nod, they can rest assured he’ll do a good job for the Tangerines.Whether or not it’s the giant Swiss shot stopper or Slovakian Matej Rakovan, Arabs are also safe in the knowledge they’ll keep each other on their toes all season.Since day one of pre-season training, Siegrist and Rakovan have been fighting hard to convince gaffer Csaba Laszlo they should be No 1 and that’s not going to stop with the visit of in-form Dunfermline.“You need to prepare every week to play,” said the 26-year-old former Aston Villa kid.“You train all week to play on Saturday, so, whatever you face, you know you have done the work during the week and you feel confident about facing it.“I want to play, that’s why I came here. So does Matej and it’s been a good relationship.“Along with Neil Alexander, our coach, we have a goalie union and it is a fun working environment.“At the end of the day we all support each other and, whoever plays, that continues.“It’s good competition and it’s good for the team.“We prepare in training and whoever is picked, they will do their best. This is the life of a goalie really.”And he believes whoever is in the team, they will handle the rigours of a Scottish style of play that is, in some ways, a change from what they’ve been used to abroad but in many others just the same.“I haven’t really found the games here that different,” Siegrist added.“The continental game, if you like, is a little bit more passing and moving than here.“They play it long at times here and quicker than you would get overseas.“I will kick it long but also play the ball out from the back.“It is important when you do play it long it is to good areas where the strikers can use it as a weapon and not just kick the ball up to the stands.”For Siegrist, the most important thing going into today is United are now approaching the game with a degree of confidence.His feeling is the new-look line-up is ready for the all-important Championship action and he sees last week’s convincing Betfred Cup win at Elgin City as proof of that.“Obviously, the results were not always there in the cup but I think we have seen a lot of improvement from game one to the last game.“We wanted to win every game, each time you step on the pitch that competitive edge needs to come out, but I think we have seen a lot of improvement despite some of the results.“We understand now how the gaffer wants us to play.“It takes practice in training as well and, at the same time as playing these games, we had to practice for a long season ahead.“There are no excuses but there were some tired legs in the games because we worked hard from Monday to Friday and then we had a game on Saturday.“Everything has to come together and I thought in the last game, especially the second half against Elgin, we put everything together and did a good job.“The physical part was there, we didn’t get tired towards the end.“We had some fresh legs coming on in the second half, we played good football and we scored goals.“It was a good game to get some confidence from.“We are now going in on a high, we have prepared well this week and we will give it our all.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united supporters society hosts race night for good

article","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMore than a year into the job and with plenty of players in and out, Dundee boss Neil McCann is beginning to feel this squad is his own, though he admits they’re “far from the finished article”.Only five first-team players remain since Neil took the reins at Dens Park in June 2017 – Cammy Kerr, Darren O’Dea, Paul McGowan, Jesse Curran and Craig Wighton.After two summer windows – still four weeks to go in the current one – and a winter transfer period, it’s clear the Dens gaffer has put his own stamp on the side, though he admits he’s still got work to do on that front.He said: “The squad has evolved since I came in.“A lot of those boys that were here when I came in served me great.“When I’ve asked them to come in and do a job, they gave me everything but a lot of those boys have decided, when they’re not featuring regularly, they want to move on, and have.“I’m still looking to bring in some more but I’m pleased with the group I have just now.“You want to mould a team and how it wants to play and it has to be your team – there’s no point coming in and trying to use the previous manager’s ideas and ways he wants to play, it has to be your own.“I’m getting to the stage where I’m seeing things coming, but we need to bolt lots together because we’re far from the finished article.”Neil has been clear in his pursuit of further options at left-back and up front.Former Morton defender Mark Russell is in on trial along with former West Brom forward Adil Nabi.

I’ve gone on record saying I can’t spend my entire time talking to the fan base but I needed to put in place something that has me speaking to them and listening to them.“The latter is as important as the former and I think I’ve done that. Some people will argue that I could have done more, some people will argue that I might have done less, but we’ve tried to get the level of communication and engagement right.“The final thing is we’ve not hidden anything. I can’t answer every single question that I’m asked but I’ll say that where I can answer, I will.”Perhaps the one troublesome area that remains for Martin and his board is with their backing of manager Csaba Laszlo.After the failure to win promotion, some want him gone, while it’s clear others are adopting a wait-and-see policy when it comes to turning up for matches.Despite a poor Betfred Cup campaign, the chairman remains firmly behind his manager and expects a rebuilt squad to be successful this season.“I said at the end of the season that Csaba was going to lead our campaign this year. We’ve worked with him over the last 11 weeks putting together his squad, his coaching staff and putting in place the other elements of the infrastructure he needs to execute his job properly.“We were very disappointed with the (Betfred) results to be honest. Every competition we go into, every match, we want to win and although it does come very early in the season with not much of a pre-season behind you, that’s the same for all clubs. We were in no different position so far as that was concerned.“I think where things were different here was the complete overhaul of the coaching and the playing staff and so we had the added complication of gelling the team basically.“We were disappointed with the outcome, but it didn’t wholly surprise us given the stage we were at in terms of rebuilding the squad.”Like his manager, Martin believes last weekend’s win at Elgin in the final Betfred tie shows the team is now gelling and ready for a strong promotion push.Even so, he does not hesitate to stress in the clearest terms what an acceptable conclusion to this season will be.“Win the league. The league is our No 1 priority, there is no doubt about that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck - leaving serious burns."},{"url":null,"title":"2018-european-championships-cycling-trial-glasgow-road-closures-in-place","story":"                          THOUSANDS of drivers and commuters are being warned to rethink travel plans ahead of a cycling event which will bring major roads to a standstill."},{"url":null,"title":"adorable-ferret-found-abandoned-in-box-in-motherwell","story":"                          THE Scottish SPCA is appealing for information after an adorable ferret was found in the middle of a road."},{"url":null,"title":"how-much-scots-workers-lost-in-unclaimed-expenses-last-year","story":"                          BRITISH workers have collectively lost out on a staggering \u0026pound962 million in unclaimed expense in the last year."},{"url":null,"title":"man-who-cant-stop-buying-things-when-he-is-asleep-feels-positive-after-making-condition-public","story":"                          A MAN with a brain disorder that sees him spend hundreds of pounds on \u0026ldquouseless shopping while he\u0027 asleep has told how he is feeling much more positive after making his condition public."},{"url":null,"title":"worried-residents-see-red-over-bid-to-build-on-greenbelt-in-neilston","story":"                          CONCERNED residents have launched a bid to prevent more than 100 homes being built on a much-loved field in Neilston."},{"url":null,"title":"hollywood-actress-jessica-lange-to-return-to-american-horror-story","story":"                          Hollywood actress\u0026nbspJessica Lange will return for the upcoming eighth season of American Horror Story."},{"url":null,"title":"serco-to-pause-lock-change-notices-for-asylum-seekers","story":"                          Serco has announced it will pause plans to issue lock-change orders to tenants whose application for asylum has been refused ahead of a court challenge."},{"url":null,"title":"olivier-ntcham-boost-for-celtic-as-tom-rogic-insists-celtic-have-enough-to-cope-with-aek-athens","story":"                          Celtic are cautiously optimistic that Olivier Ntcham will be fit to\u0026nbspfeature against Greek side AEK Athens on Wednesday night.

In addition to converting an equestrian centre into a holiday complex, the others are for a farm house, a detached house and an agricultural shed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"These may herald even more development in turn threatening to form a circle that, if unchecked, would eventually widen, join-up and constrict the core site protected by our charity,\" Mr Skinner said.He also cited the recent approval of a golf course at the Coul Links which falls within the Loch Fleet site of scientific special interest.He questioned whether either designation would still have any meaning if they were going to be run roughshod over by the current planning process.\"Culloden and the Coul Links are just two examples of a worrying trend,\" he said. \"Scotland\u0027 heritage is too often being cast aside for short-term economic gain.\"Four years ago, we argued for a planning framework which has the long-term wellbeing of our heritage sites built into it.

On Friday, we had about 25 – mostly from parents whose kids were playing in their back gardens and were covered in hoverflies.“Mostly, we’ve been reassuring people that hoverflies are harmless, though we have been going to the homes of vulnerable people to double check they are not noticing wasps and we have more appointments booked this week.”Mr Mailer said he has seen high levels of hoverflies in the north-east before but these are the biggest swarms he has seen in a decade working in pest control.The insects tend to swarm when warm sunny weather follows a rainy spell as they are attracted to the honey dew from trees and plants.Peter Stewart, of Aberkill pest control, said: “We are taking many calls from people who are in a panic as they think they are being invaded by swarms of wasps, but they are hoverflies.“They are mainly in the gardens and we have had a report of them swarming an oil rig.“Hoverflies are harmless and do not have a sting unlike the wasp.“I would advise the public to keep doors and windows closed where possible to prevent them entering the home, or buy some fly mesh.“Wasps, on the other hand, can be dangerous as one of our customers found out when they ended up in hospital with anaphylactic shock.“My best advice would be to stay well away from wasps and not to try home-made methods of eradication such as using petrol.

Apart from the technical information, which went a little over my head, it felt the same as before. The ground is uniformed, neat and tidy and it is so peaceful you feel like you are soaring in the air. It was simply stunning.”With nerves of steel, Chris piloted the plane and even had a back seat passenger, daughter Lesley.Lesley, 54, who works as a receptionist at Saks Hair \u0026amp Beauty in Union Square, said: “I knew my mum would definitely go for it and I was more than happy to go up with her then and will be happy to do so again.”Flying instructor Bill Anderson, who operates with Buchan Aero Club, declared Chris had “the knack” and she received hundreds of likes on daughter Lesley’s social media page for her efforts.So will Chris be seeking out her pilot licence anytime soon?“No,” she exclaimed. “But I can’t wait for my next lesson.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mckenna good enough to star in england","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSkipper Graeme Shinnie has no doubt wanted man Scott McKenna could cut it not just in the Championship but the English top flight – although he hopes the defender stays at Pittodrie.Swansea have already approached Aberdeen to inquire about the availability of the 21-year-old centre-back.The Championship outfit are lining up a £2 million bid for the Scotland international before the transfer window closes in England on August 9.McKenna will face Rangers in the Premiership opener at Pittodrie tomorrow as the Reds aim to bounce back from their Euro exit.Aberdeen suffered massive disappointment when losing 3-1 after extra-time to Burnley at Turf Moor to exit the Europa League 4-2 on aggregate.Shinnie reckons the way McKenna shackled the Clarets big-money strikers, including £15m signing Chris Wood, proves he can hack it in England’s top flight.He only hopes that move comes a long way down the line and that tomorrow’s clash with Rangers at Pittodrie is not McKenna’s last for the Reds.Shinnie said: “Scott McKenna and Mikey Devlin were brilliant again in what was a tough task with the physicality of the two Burnley boys up front.\u0026#8220But they dealt with it brilliantly and that gave us the platform in the game.“Scott could go to a Premier League team (in the future), as he showed what he can do against a Premier League team in Burnley.“However, he is a level-headed guy as well and wants to rack up as many games as he can, which is really positive for a young player.\u0026#8220He wants to get the experience and wants to get the games.“There is no doubt he will probably end up going at some point but we will hold on to him as long as we can.”Aberdeen rejected an offer in excess of £1 million from Hull City for Scotland cap McKenna during the January transfer window. Since then he has made his international breakthrough and captained Scotland in a 1-0 summer friendly loss to Mexico.McKenna will be at the heart of the defence in a game against Rangers that marks new Ibrox boss Steven Gerrard’s first domestic game.After the disappointment of losing at Turf Moor, skipper Shinnie challenged the Reds to bounce back with a victory.He said: “Pittodrie will be packed for Rangers and it is a good game to have off the back of the Euro tie.“We need to put that (loss to Burnley) at the back of our minds.“It is a massive game but that is what it is like at Aberdeen – big games come thick and fast.“We know the crowd will be there in their numbers so it is another game where we have to step it up.”Aberdeen were up against a side with an immensely superior budget in Burnley, who have a £37m players’ wage budget.Tomorrow the figures may be smaller but there is still a gulf between the budget of Rangers and that of Aberdeen.The Ibrox club have backed Gerrard’s rebuilding by sanctioning transfers in excess of £5m during the summer.There have also been high-profile loan deals that will require high wages.Shinnie does not care about the cash the Ibrox club are splashing out, though.On the disparity between the two club’s budgets, he said: “That is out of our control and we just focus on ourselves.“The games against Burnley have been positive for us and we look to take that momentum into the league.”Aberdeen may have been knocked out of Europe but Shinnie reckons they regained some pride for Scottish football.It is a tie he believes the Dons deserved to win over the two legs to book a third qualifying round clash against Istanbul Basaksehir of Turkey.He said: “In Scotland teams know what we are all about – we have proved that over the last couple of years.“Maybe we have now shown people down in England what Scottish football is all about.“It is not as bad as what the English make it out to be.“But in Scotland, in terms of us, we have shown what we are all about.“We have got a big season ahead of us again to show that.”Aberdeen may have been underdogs against Premier League Burnley but, make no mistake, there was a belief in this squad they could progress.It was this confidence which made losing out in extra time all the more difficult to take for the Aberdonian, particularly as the Reds had opportunities to win the tie.He said: “We are gutted that we did not get through because that is what we wanted and what we set out to achieve.“No matter who it was against, we wanted to get through and we had the opportunities to do that.“It is disappointing but we will take the positives.“We can be proud of what we did… but it wasn’t good enough.“At the start of the game Burnley were good, although we didn’t start great in the first half.“Once we got to grips with the game, we got right into it.“In the second half, again, we didn’t start overly great but went on to be the better team and create the better chances.I thought, over the two legs, we were probably the better team but we didn’t take our chances and, in the end, that kills you.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 1:23 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On the afternoon of July 2, my car overturned in Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig.Fortunately, I was not injured but I would like to thank the emergency services \u0026#8211 ambulance and police \u0026#8211 neighbours and workmen who pulled me out of the car after smashing the glass.Everyone was so helpful.I didn’t get your names but appreciate your help.We have a wonderful community here in Argyll.Anne Lavelle, Ardrishaig.Sir,I would like to thank everyone who made last Friday\u0026#8217s quiz night in aid of the Lochgilphead Celtic and Pictish Festival such a success.Thanks to Stan at the Stag Hotel for providing the room and a round of drinks for the winners.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains.

A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

He played for two seasons at Murray Park, taking part in tournaments at Turin in Italy  and in Russia at Shakhtar Donetsk before moving to Ralston, where he signed for St Mirren FC and had an enjoyable two seasons before returning to Lochgilphead Red Star YFC.Proud dad Dougie also happens to be the Red Star manager, and he said: \u0026#8216As a manager, it is always sad to lose your best players, but after the team\u0026#8217s success last year we had rumblings that something may happen at the end of the season.\u0026#8216As a club, we are delighted that one of our players has been given the chance to go and make an impact at senior level and just goes to show the hard work put in by the volunteers at the soccer centre, youth and amateur teams that there will be chances if players show the right attitude and commitment, whether at our level or at the youths.\u0026#8216Locally there are a number of youngsters who are with Partick Thistle, Hamilton, Rangers and others, which is great for such a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8217Taking off his manager\u0026#8217s hat, Dougie added: \u0026#8216As parents, both myself and Fiona are delighted.

Sadly the rally was over for both crews after stage four due to electrical problems and other issues.Donald Bowness battled it out in the usual competitive class two with his Vauxhall Nova with Andrew Blackwood on the notes. Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine. Rally journalist John Fife was prompted to comment: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s like watching two spoilt weans scrapping over one tube of smarties.\u0026#8217Sunday saw a complete change in the weather and crews continued to battle it out in some very wet and slippy stages. Donald Bowness finished 11th overall and first in class two, followed by Michael Harbour in second. Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"jenny celebrates 90 years","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 7:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowJenny Speirs of Inveraray recently celebrated her 90th birthday.She celebrated the milestone in style with a lunch party for family, friends and neighbours including cousins from Australia.Jenny thanks everyone for the lovely cards, flowers and gifts given to her during the celebrations.Donations in lieu of presents, at Jenny\u0026#8217s request, raised £300 for Cancer Research.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sheep and showers in high quality blackface show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 04/08/18, 8:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA high quality show of sheep was held at Cairndow amid heavy showers interrupted by fiery sunshine.The annual Cowal Blackface Sheep Breeders\u0026#8217 Association show at Clachan \u0026#8211 right beside the Loch Fyne Oysters complex \u0026#8211 drew curious (if slightly bemused) tourists and seasoned hill shepherds in almost equal measure.The sheep show has, in recent years, been supported by a display of vintage tractors and other machinery, and this year Cowal Vintage Transport Club and Bute Vintage Club provided the gleaming hardware for visitors to enjoy.You can find pictures of the vintage machinery show on page 34.In the show ring, the overall champion came from Dyke Farm, Milton of Campsie, with a young ewe by £24,000 Elmscleugh out of a ewe by a son of Travis.The reserve overall was a ewe by Buffalo out of a dam by a £4,000 Midlock from Messrs MacPherson, Balliemeanoch, Loch Awe.In the section confined to the district of Cowal, the champion was from Pole Farm, Lochgoilhead, with a gimmer by Spectre out of a ewe by a £5,200 Allanfauld sire.The confined reserve champion \u0026#8211 and best sheep of the opposite sex to the overall champion \u0026#8211 was from Messrs Campbell, Drimsynie, Lochgoilhead, with a shearling tup by Allanfauld Pogba out of ewe by a 40k Nunnerie sire.

The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

We are confident our proposals have reached an optimum balance between these aspects.\u0026#8216As a responsible developer, we believe it is important to seek public opinion on our proposals and take that feedback into consideration when developing our projects.

Before the roads were made these were important links- the sea unites and the land divides.Arguably the most important ferry followed the Inveraray \u0026#8211 St Catherines route, connecting with coach services to Loch Goil and the onward steamer to Greenock or Glasgow.At one time a large sailing boat carried horses and cattle. A rowing or sailing yawl conveyed pilgrims, pedlars, travellers and soldiers. Pilgrims and blind persons were carried free.From the 17th Century the ferry and ferryman\u0026#8217s house were auctioned annually by Inveraray Town Council to the highest bidder, with the burgh providing the two vessels. The ferryman kept the fares, and part of the deal was that the minister and magistrates would travel free of charge.When Inveraray new town was built in the 18th Century the Ferry Land housed the ferrier, who supplemented his income by running a dram shop. The Ferry Inn was a popular pub until 1917, when its licence was revoked.In 1827 David Napier, later a famous shipbuilder, introduced two steamers, the Thalia and Robert Bruce, from Inveraray to St Catherines and other ports on Loch Fyne. In 1836 the Lochgoil and Loch Long Steamboat Company became tenants of the ferry with a small paddle steamer, though the rowing/sailing boats were still available for a lower fare.From St Catherines their horse-drawn coach conveyed passengers to Lochgoilhead, from where they joined a steamer to the central belt.In 1856 the company introduced a new steamer, the Argyle. She was not a success, with author Alexander Smith describing her as \u0026#8216a small wash-tub of a steamer that carries you across Loch Fyne in an hour\u0026#8217.In 1865 the Inveraray Ferry and Coach Company took over with their beautiful little steamer, the Fairy.The route did not pay, however, and in 1892 the town council set up the ferry as a municipal enterprise with Fairy II, a little steel paddle steamer. When to town council gave up running the service in 1909, Mr John Dewar continued until the Fairy II was wrecked in the great storm of November 1912.Thereafter there were a number of ferriers. James Douglas used a Loch Fyne skiff fitted with a motor and Hope MacArthur operated launches called the Happy Return and the Jean.The car and bus rendered the sea link unnecessary and the service ended in 1963.A winter trip across Loch Fyne is recorded in the following song, sung to the tune \u0026#8216Kitty of Lochgoil\u0026#8217. Here are some of the verses:The Fairy in the Fog\u0026#8216Twas in the year of \u0026#821781On Januar\u0026#8217 the fourth dayThe steamer Fairy crossed Loch FyneTo Sweet St Catherines bay.Our Captain Bold was Duncan BellOur pilot Donuil DhuThe engineer Shon GilliesAnd Dugal Piobair was the crew.The passengers were soon aboardThat Coachy Jock had broughtAnd then again through blinding fogOur homeward way we sought.The day with fog was thick and darkYou could neither hear nor seeBut Donuil Dhu just kept her noseStraight from St Catherines quay.The pilot at his stemmy postStood firm as any rockThe compass true before his eyesJust like my grandfather clockAs we came near the Newtown bay.Our reckoning scarce could failSaid Dougal Piobair to himself\u0026#8216I wish we saw the jail\u0026#8217.The captain stood upon the deckA few feet from the funnelAnd to the pilot passed the word\u0026#8216Keep clear of Mackenzie\u0026#8217s tunnel\u0026#8217.Already we were sheering offOur course we knew quite wellWhen through the fog some lengths awayThere came a dismal yell.\u0026#8216Now what was that?\u0026#8217 the captain cried\u0026#8216I ne\u0026#8217er heard the like before\u0026#8217Said Dugal Piobair: \u0026#8216Sure it is a Pochkan on the shore\u0026#8217.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"food music and fun at tayvallich weekend gala","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/08/18, 7:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTayvallich was the place to be last weekend when the annual village gala was celebrated in style.The Tayvallich Weekend is the main fundraiser for Tayvallich Village Hall, which is preparing for a major redevelopment.The festivities kicked off on Friday evening with a barbecue at the Tayvallich Inn. This was a chance for villagers and visitors to get together to share food and drink, with musical entertainment from Paisley singer/songwriter Alan McKim.A wet start to Saturday July 28 failed to deter the enthusiasm of the crowds who converged on Tayvallich Village Hall for fun activities such as children’s sports, a bouncy castle and a pop-up crazy golf course that kept adults and children amused. The marquees provided shelter from the showers and a chance to browse the stalls.As well as classics like the bottle stall and guess the weight of the cake, there were representations from local businesses, voluntary groups and organisations, including the RNLI, Friends of the Sound of Jura, Heart of Argyll Wildlife and the 19th Argyll Scouts.After a break for lunch of paella, barbecue, sandwiches and home baking, the sun came out in time for the fabulous dog show, which featured novelty classes such as best six legs, fancy dress and the dog and handler race.Events moved into the hall on Saturday evening for the family ceilidh, where the fantastic Argyll Ceilidh Trail band kept the dancers on their feet into Sunday morning.

He said: “The AU500 group asked me to help out with sponsorship, but I do a lot for the club with my work Caledonian Vehicle Solutions. “So then I said my band would record a song and donate cash to the club through that. “As a band we haven’t written an original song about Ayr United so hopefully people will like it and it will stick around for years to come.”  Jason, 32, has supported Ayr United for as long as he can remember. Seaside Sons will also play Prestfest this Saturday and will support Kyle Falconer on Sunday at Elliots. The band recruited Ayr supporting musicians to help with the recording.

Much the same reaction as when food is about and the hungry gulls swoop. South Ayrshire Council has just introduced tough metal bins in Ayr High Street that gulls cannot peck rubbish and scraps out. At the moment with starving fledglings about, some of the birds are highly aggressive. Former air traffic control staffer Dave Kennedy,65, of Ayr said: “Some people feed gulls and that encourages them back. They are a nuisance, feral and these bins are a good idea.” Christopher Cooper,32, is a care home worker who lives in the town centre and said: “I cannot even open my windows as they are too noisy and seem to go mental at 4am. I took a video and put it on Snapchat. Yesterday one stole a chip from my pal’s butty. More effort should be made.” Former council worker David Nichol,63, of Kilmaurs, said: “I don’t know much about ornithology but gulls they are so aggressive. “These bins are a great idea but if the gulls get worse here it will affect tourism. They are lovely looking birds, but they even fight in mid-air.” Retired council clerical officer Anne Russell,69, of Auchinleck, added: “The bins are great but the council needs to be more aggressive and take action against folk feeding them. “They have notices up about not feeding them - but people are still doing it. “We need a gull patrol like a traffic warden.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilKilmaursAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields two things must","story":"NewsBob Shields: Two things must happen at the Station HotelEmergency committee must be set upShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning07:00, 5 AUG 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“Ding dong . . . this is a Scot Rail passenger announcement . . . the next arrival at platforms one, two, three and four will be the 2018 death of Ayr Station. “This is due to Ayr Station Hotel deteriorating on South Ayrshire Council’s doorstep and no heads being on the line. “We apologise for any inconvenience and the loss of hundreds of thousands of pounds of your money. “The next train from a functional Ayr Station will the 2020 to Glasgow Central”. Yes dear readers, if all of the above was improbable – it might even have been amusing. But the demise and ultimate destruction of South Ayrshire’s busiest transport hub isn’t improbable – it’s inevitable. Last weekend, most of the United Kingdom was looking skywards for a glimpse of a “blood moon”. But on Saturday, I looked skywards as I walked across the Station Bridge . ... and all I saw was a bloody disgrace. Belts and straps have now been attached to Ayr Station Hotel’s chimney stacks in a bid to safely secure them. New areas at the Smith Street end of the station have been declared unsafe. The “no-go area” fencing that once cordoned a section of the front car park has been extended to barricade the entire building. If this was 1945, we could probably keep Rudolph Hess banged up in there! The harsh fact is that Ayr Station and its hotel have moved on from being a giant embarrassment to becoming the biggest threat to public safety, the local economy and the environment in South Ayrshire’s living memory. And what are South Ayrshire’s elected members doing about it? Er .... they’re all on their summer recess! On safety – is the Station Bridge REALLY safe for cars and pedestrians? A single lane was closed for “scaffolding work” – but it’s been scaffold-free for five weeks. If the gable-end chimneys need belts and buckles, is it prudent to allow the public to pass barely fifty yards below them? On the economy – I know my own business has been affected by the railway chaos. Many of my Ayr racecourse regulars by-passed the town centre and headed straight to the track from the station’s east side. And if I’m feeling it – God help the shops, bars, eateries and taxi drivers based around Smith Street and Burns Statue Square. On the environment – has anyone contemplated the dust, fumes and noise pollution that will surely come with demolishing a giant sandstone structure that’s visible from the Kilmarnock by-pass? MP Bill Grant was in my boozer last weekend – but on the first week of his hols, I extended the courtesy of letting him socialise with his friends. But I know he reads this page – and I hope he and MSP John Scott will be in agreement that two things must happen soon: 1) An Ayr Station Emergency Committee be set up involving all stakeholders – including structural and civil engineers, Scot Rail, South Ayrshire Council, road traffic management and local businesses. Its remit would be look at the entire station issue – and how best to fit all future works into the community. And if they can get Ayr Station Hotel’s owner to show up – a bit of public flogging wouldn’t go amiss either. 2) An independent investigation be set up to demand the facts from South Ayrshire Council on what they did – and didn’t do – as they watched an iconic town centre building fall into ruin right in front of them. And it has to be root and branch – every correspondence, every conversation, every e-mail – involving everyone from the Malaysian owners to our own Council executives and elected members. The council tax payers of South Ayrshire deserve the truth. And they certainly deserve better management of local resources than this current shambles .Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentTaxesAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"supermarket runs out 10p bags","story":"NewsSupermarket runs out of 10p bags in AyrWorkers had to resort to giving out more expensive bag-for-life style carriers in a bid to appease grocery laden shoppers.Share\u0026nbspByStephen Houston15:24, 1 AUG 2018Updated15:25, 1 AUG 2018News (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMorrisons in Ayr ran out of 10p plastic bags after bosses forgot to order them in. . . . that’s the claim by under-pressure staff.

The store is said to be among the most profitable Morrisons supermarkets in Scotland. But one staff member said: “This is the third time this month they’ve forgotten to order in the 10p bags - it’s unbelievable.

But vehicles needing access to Old Cumnock Old Church for weddings or funerals will continue to have access. These vehicles will have to show a permit to access The Square. Any other vehicles will be hit by a fixed-penalty notice if they flout the new traffic regulations. The move is designed to improve safety to pedestrians and cyclists in the Square. One community councillor said it would stop parking outside the hairdressers and takeaways at the Square: “Traffic in the Square will be limited,” he added. “From the beginning of August anyone driving a car would need to have a permit. “It will be limited to funeral cars, wedding cars for church services “The main thing is they are going to block off pedestrian crossing outside the Royal Hotel. “So the cars are going to have to come in and go back out into Lugar Street. “It is going to be mayhem in Lugar Street. “I suggested reversing the one way system at Hamilton Place and make it street pedestrian only.” Another community councillor asked how it would be implemented. He added: “Who is going to patrol it? “Will it be police or traffic wardens. “I haven’t seen police in the square.” Stewart Turner, head of road at Ayrshire Roads Alliance, said: “Access to The Square will be limited to vehicles directly associated with wedding and funeral operations at Old Cumnock Old Church. “These vehicles will be required to display a permit to access The Square.

This will enable a Parking Attendant employed by the Council to issue a Penalty Charge Notice to any vehicle within The Square contravening the restrictions.  “Exemptions to the waiting  and loading restrictions are exactly the same as the access restriction.  “I do not anticipate traffic congestion on Lugar Street as a result of this Order. “The Order was promoted to prevent danger to pedestrians and cyclists in The Square. “The Order was advertised on Wednesday March 28 and received no objections. “The Order is fully supported by Police Scotland and they will be responsible for enforcing the restrictions.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPolice ScotlandCumnockAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"kelso-woman-accused-of-being-involved-in-two-bust-ups","story":"A KELSO woman has been accused of being involved in two bust-ups.\nNicola Turnbull, 31, of Abbotseat, denies behaving in a threatening or abusive manner at the Vibe Night Club\nin Kelso on May 6, knocking over a drink, threatening another person with violence and struggling and fighting with another.\nShe also pleaded not guilty to assaulting a female at The Square in Kelso, by pulling her hair and repeatedly punching her on the face to her injury.\nA trial date has been fixed for October 4 with an intermediate hearing on September 3.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-borders-council-to-mark-merchant-navy-day","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council is to host a special reception to honour the services of Merchant Navy personnel.\nAnd Borderers who have previously or currently serve are being asked to come forward to attend the event.\nMerchant Navy Day is held on September 3 every year to honour the brave men and women who kept Britain afloat during both World Wars, and also celebrate the importance of modern day merchant seafarers.\nA civic reception will be held on the same day at Newtown St Boswells to mark the occasion.\nCouncil convener, Councillor David Parker, said: \u0026ldquoThe Merchant Navy was given its name 100 years ago at the end of World War I, with King George V acknowledging their efforts in providing supplies to Britain.\n\u0026ldquoWith this special anniversary, we felt it was appropriate to mark the efforts of our local personnel and would request any Borders seafarers to get in contact with us so we can invite you to the reception.\nAny Merchant Navy personnel from the Borders wishing to go should email CorporateMgtSupport@scotborders.gov.uk or phone 01835 826571 or contact councillor Sandy Aitchison \u0026ndash saitchison@scotborders.gov.uk.

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp.

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

This year it was reprinted by Comely Bank Publishing as Russain Doll.In a strange synchronicity, at virtually the same time as last week’s talk, former SNP leader and MP Alex Salmond, who now broadcasts for Russian television, was dumped as a potential chairman by the investor trying to takeover Johnston Press.Drawing on her own seven years BBC radio experience, Ms Lloyd’s heroine, Anna, is a radio producer at the Scottish Broadcasting Corporation as it has been renamed after independence.The book’s blurb states: ‘In an independent Scotland, Russia attempts a soft occupation under the noses of the novice government.‘Against her best intentions, she finds herself falling for a Russian diplomat tasked with delivering Scotland into Moscow’s hands.‘As war looms, will this relationship save, or destroy, Anna?’Ms Lloyd, a scientist, runner and skier says she was on the river or pitch more than in a lab.This description fits Anna who is often described as ‘out for a run’ and Ms Lloyd says is: ‘Feisty, smart, sporty and spouting opinions.’‘When I wrote the book, the Brexit vote had not happened and Donald Trump was a bad television games show host,’ said Ms Lloyd. ‘It was written before the concept of fake news.‘It is more of a love story than a political novel. I remembered looking at photos from when Paris was liberated in 1945 after the German occupation and wondering what happened to the collaborators.‘It is written in a post-independence parallel world, so much has happened since 2014.‘Russia presents an amazing enigma of tremendous wealth but is their relationship with the West more about posturing?’One member of the dozen who attended the talk asked: ‘Do you think Scots would prefer Euros to Roubles?’Ms Lloyd said she glossed over the question of Europe but did imagine that Scotland would have to renegotiate its seat at the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.Ms Lloyd is working on a second book and said: ‘I have young children so I can indulge myself.’Russian Doll is available for £9.99 from Amazon and booksellers or direct from the author, who also sells a natty line in sports socks.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter sea photos wanted","story":"Photographers across the UK have just two weeks to enter their best images of the sea in an annual photography competition run by national maritime charity, the Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society.The competition, which closes on Monday, August 13, encourages amateur and professional photographers to submit pictures that best encapsulate Britain’s enduring connection with the sea.It celebrates the nation’s proud maritime heritage and our reliance on seafarers.The competition’s prestigious judging panel includes experts from the Sunday Times, the I, and Amateur Photographer Magazine, alongside the charity’s chief executive, Captain Justin Osmond.The overall winner of the competition will be presented with a voucher for photographic equipment.The Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society provides financial assistance to fishermen, mariners and their dependants who are suffering hardship, whether due to accident, ill health, unemployment or in retirement after a life spent working at sea.In the last year the charity received 560 new applications for assistance and distributed £1.4 million in more than 2,000 cases of need.To enter the competition go to: www.shipwreckedmariners.org.uk or  www.facebook/shipwreckedmariners and @ShipwreckedSoc.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lotto draws 4","story":"The draw for Dunaverty\u0026#8217s three number lotto was made on July 19.The winning numbers were five, seven and 17.There were no winners and the next draw for a jackpot of £200 will be held on August 12.Tickets are available from committee members, the club steward, Muneroy tearooms and the Burnside bar.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"caledonia way cycling companion guidebook","story":"A comprehensive pedaling plan to the cycle route from Campbeltown to Inverness was published last week.The 118 page handlebar bag sized spiral bound book, to guide cyclists on National Cycle Route 78, is so far available at Machrihanish Holiday Park, Patersons Bakery Carradale, Skipness Smokehouse and Argyll Backpackers at Inverneil.Independent publishers, The Offcomers \u0026#8211 Janet Moss and Pete Martin, visited Campbeltown last Thursday, from their Cumbria base, to launch the book\u0026#8217s first edition.It was the pair\u0026#8217s second visit since May when they put finishing touches to the production which started about 18 months ago.Mr Martin said: \u0026#8216The Caledonia Way covers some of Scotland\u0026#8217s best scenery with plenty of emptiness.\u0026#8216The guide has full listing sections including complete Ordnance Survey maps of each section, a comprehensive accommodation guide and locations where cycle spares might be found.\u0026#8216We have cycled the route at least once in both directions although much of the research has been during the winter months.\u0026#8216Some of the toughest bits of the route are between Campbeltown and Oban.\u0026#8217The route is split into six sections and includes fully Ordnance Survey maps detailing each day\u0026#8217s ride.Travel to Campbeltown is more complicated than to Inverness, for the bike borne tourist, but the Offcomers suggest the ferry as a good option particularly as the fare is £7.90 and the bike goes free.Apart from some slight niggles, such as the second line, describing Campbeltown as being at the southern end of the Kintyre Peninsular (sic), it is a fine guide to the route.There are ominous omissions in the accommodation listing and places to eat.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Mattie Edmond, club steward, handed over a cheque for \u0026pound1,410 to Fiona Brown and Alison Clancy from the charity after they hosted Pancreatic Cancer Scotland following two events on Easter Sunday and a show with the Jersey Beats organised by Pete Barrie with support from the Prestonpans Hearts Supporters Club.

Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier.

Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

The scenes were filmed at Yellowcraig Beach and two houses in Haddington, as well as some filming at Pease Bay in the Scottish Borders \u0026ndash all to promote Aldi\u0027s \u0027Special Buys\u0027.  The crew chose East Lothian due to its great surfing beaches and its film charter \u0026ndash an agreement between council departments to work together to accommodate film requests in the East Lothian area wherever possible.  In past years, East Lothian has been the backdrop for films including The Railway Man, starring Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman, and Steven Spielberg\u0027s The BFG. The county also been used as a filming location for several adverts and many TV series, including the popular show Outlander.  Dave Neilson produced the Aldi advert via his award-winning company Filming Scotland.  When asked if he would return to East Lothian to film in the future, he said: \"Absolutely, there are so many locations that fit into a lot of the creative briefs we get through.  \"Also its good facilities and close proximity to Edinburgh it makes it an easy option in term of logistics.  \"In addition, the council are great at jumping on film requests quickly and give a very personal service so again that goes a long way to making the film process smooth.\"  Councillor John McMillan, cabinet spokesperson for economic development and tourism, said: \"It is extremely beneficial for filming to take place in East Lothian as it helps put East Lothian on the map both in terms of attracting other film companies and for potential tourists seeing our beautiful county on screen.  \"Obviously, it also helps our economy by safeguarding jobs in the hospitality industry and local shops, which all help to service film crews and sometimes even big stars!  \"I\u0027m delighted to hear Dave\u0027s positive comments about filming here and it just shows that our film charter has created an efficient partnership-working atmosphere and that can only be a good thing for East Lothian.\"  Rosie Ellison, head of Film Edinburgh, the film office for Edinburgh, East Lothian and the Scottish Borders, said: \"East Lothian has long been a popular destination for filmmakers, with East Lothian Council working in partnership with the region\u0027s film office Film Edinburgh since the mid-1990s, together assuring a film-friendly response to over 400 productions, including feature films Mary Queen of Scots, Outlaw King, Under The Skin, The Railway Man, TV dramas Outlander and Case Histories, and adverts for Chinese water company Ganten and now Aldi.\"  The Aldi advert can be seen online at youtube/watch?v=zRyK6ped4Eg"},{"url":null,"title":"better-if-boat-had-sunk-says-skipper-after-running-aground-at-prestonpans","story":"  Carl Ramsay said he was appalled by the abuse he claims he suffered at the hands of some locals after finding himself stranded on the beach at Prestonpans.  And he claimed his attempts to repair his stricken vessel were scuppered by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), which denied him permission to move to nearby Cockenzie Harbour to carry out the work.  Mr Ramsay, who is from West Yorkshire, told the Courier: \"I think it is a disgrace that East Lothian has no contingency plan for shipwrecks despite being a fishing community.  \"I have been threatened and abused while staying at the beach at Prestonpans with my boat and when I managed to float it and asked for permission to move to Cockenzie Harbour I was refused by the MCA.  \"I\u0027ve lost everything, this was my home and I invested everything in it.

He set up camp on the beach as he looked into repairing the vessel but, while he initially said he received support from the local community, he told the Courier it did not last.  He said: \"I\u0027ve been abused and threatened by locals for staying at the beach.  \"My camp has some furniture which was donated by locals when I first arrived but since then I have been confronted by others angry that I am there.  \"I think it is shameful how I have been treated by this fishing community after becoming shipwrecked on their beach.\"  Mr Ramsay began breaking up the vessel last week, burning timber on the beach."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8124595.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cctv-considered-to-combat-foresters-park-vandals","story":"  Enjoyleisure, which manages the park on behalf of East Lothian Council, has confirmed it is looking at the possibility of introducing CCTV across the facility.  The announcement comes after another incident at the park saw goalposts broken and scorch marks left on the 3G and 2G pitches.  The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoBoth the council and enjoyleisure are in talks about the possibility of introducing CCTV at Foresters Park so a decision will be taken on that in due course and local councillors will be kept updated.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that Foresters Park has unfortunately suffered some vandalism so the council\u0026rsquos Safer Communities Team continues to ensure that patrols cover the area regularly.  Earlier this month it was claimed on social media that young female players had been subjected to harassment from males as they trained at the park however, no formal complaints about any incident have been made to the council or police.  A council spokesperson added: \u0026ldquoWhile we are aware of vandalism issues, we have not been made aware of allegations of female players being harassed during training.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company had also contacted Prestonpans Community Council about its plans, with the former Cockenzie Power Station site seen as a possible home for the work.  It has also been suggested that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

Norwegian Air Shuttle has the second worst performance, followed by Vueling Airlines, Thomas Cook Airlines and BMI Regional.  The ranking features the 44 airlines with at least 2,000 scheduled flights from UK airports last year.  Average delay figures take into account every flight that operated, including those that were on time. Cancelled services are excluded from the CAA data.  Scandinavian Airlines is the most punctual, with aircraft typically taking off just seven minutes behind schedule.  Aer Lingus has the second best record, followed by Air France, Alitalia and Delta Airlines.  The average delay across all flights was 15 minutes.  A spokeswoman for Wizz Air said: \u0026ldquoA number of issues specific to the UK, including airport infrastructure, airspace congestion and slot restrictions contribute to a significantly worse on-time performance of our UK routes compared to the rest of our network.  She noted that disruption was caused by \u0026ldquoparticularly severe winter weather last year and added that the airline is taking measures to improve its punctuality, such as basing eight aircraft in the UK to reduce its exposure to inbound delays.  Norwegian Air Shuttle\u0026rsquos UK flights mainly consist of short-haul services from London Gatwick, Manchester and Edinburgh. Its average delay of 22 minutes does not take into account the majority of Norwegian\u0026rsquos long-haul flights from UK airports, which are operated by a British subsidiary.  A Norwegian spokesman said frequent air traffic control (ATC) strikes across Europe and adverse weather \u0026ldquoinvariably impact punctuality and are beyond the control of airlines.  He went on: \u0026ldquoWe do everything possible to ensure that flights operate to allow passengers to reach their destination as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoNorwegian is committed to keep improving punctuality, and where factors are within our direct control we have introduced new measures to continue delivering a smooth, efficient experience for our passengers.  The CAA said punctuality \u0026ldquoclearly matters to airline passengers and it publishes the performance of carriers to allow people to \u0026ldquomake informed choices about which airline to fly with.  Dale Keller, chief executive of airline association BAR UK, said delays are \u0026ldquoextremely costly to carriers.  He added that airlines are \u0026ldquofully engaged with governments, ATC providers and airports to minimise the causes of disruption which are outside their own control.  Passengers on delayed flights from UK airports are entitled to assistance and compensation depending on the cause and length of the disruption.  When flights are delayed for more than two hours, airlines have to provide free access to phone calls or emails, meals and refreshments, as well as hotel accommodation if an overnight stay is required.  Passengers can also claim compensation when flights are delayed by more than three hours unless there are \u0026ldquoextraordinary circumstances such as severe weather or a security alert.  Payouts range from 250 euro (\u0026pound223) to 600 euro (\u0026pound535) depending on the length of the flight and how long it was delayed.  Editor of magazine Which? Travel, Rory Boland, advised delayed passengers to \u0026ldquomake sure you make a claim for the compensation that you are entitled to.  He added: \u0026ldquoAirlines now need to do the right thing and introduce automatic compensation. Passengers should not have to jump through hoops to claim back the money they are owed."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8164752.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-zealands-premier-back-at-work-after-six-weeks-of-maternity-leave","story":"  At the start of a Cabinet meeting on Monday, she thanked her colleagues and Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters for keeping the government operating while she was away.  \u0026ldquoThe last six weeks have been wonderful, not only because of the birth of our healthy daughter, but because we have been gifted by this cabinet, by the people of New Zealand, this time together and I know that that was guarded by this Cabinet but also by yourself, minister Peters.

He said the government of an independent Scotland should therefore charge the Ministry of Defence around \u0026pound1bn a year to keep the weapons north of the border.  The timetable, which is four times the one in the SNP\u0026rsquos 2014 independence plans, is likely to anger party activists committed to the rapid removal of Trident.  With Nicola Sturgeon considering whether to press for a second independence referendum in light of Brexit, the SNP is currently updating its prospectus for life outside the UK.  However to date the party\u0026rsquos efforts have focused on the economic case for independence.  Mr Crawford told Scotland on Sunday an independent Scotland could not sensibly demand Trident\u0027s removal from the Clyde for many years after independence.  Although there are other potential homes for the submarine fleet, including Devonport and Barrow-in-Furness, nowhere else in the UK has the equivalent of Faslane\u0026rsquos sister site at Coulport, where missile warheads are stored.  The issue is not new - indeed, many in the SNP see the lack of an alternative base as a way for independence to force the UK to abandon its nuclear deterrent.  However Mr Crawford, a former army officer who previously advised the SNP on defence and is publishing a paper on the subject in the autumn, said the party hard to be practical about Trident.  He said: \u0026ldquoAn independent Scotland cannot really sensibly insist on removal of the UK\u0026rsquos nuclear deterrent from its waters in the short to medium term.  \u0026ldquoTherefore some pragmatic solution has to be adopted. The pragmatic solution is, in my opinion, to rent the Faslane nuclear facilities to the rest of the UK until such time as some other arrangement can be brought about.  \u0026ldquoIf there is any chance of Scotland becoming an independent country in 2021, it would take the UK government at least 20 years to build the equivalent to the Faslane/Coulport facilities elsewhere in the UK.\" The White Paper on independence published by then First Minister Alex Salmond said Trident could be gone within five years.  It said: \u0026ldquoFollowing a vote for independence, we would make early agreement on the speediest safe removal of nuclear weapons a priority. This would be with a view to the removal of Trident within the first term of the Scottish Parliament following independence.  Mr Crawford said: \u0026ldquoIt is the most emotive defence-related issue in the whole independence debate.  \"The difficult thing for the SNP leadership would be selling this to the foot soldiers. The broad base of the independence movement is very much grounded in the CND movement. I am completely sympathetic to that.  \u0026ldquoThe SNP Government might look at this plan and say it doesn\u0026rsquot deliver our promise to remove Trident, but it would be the biggest bargaining chip that an independent Scotland could have.  Tory MSP Douglas Ross said: \u0026ldquoThese comments add an element of realism to the SNP\u0026rsquos defence policy for an independent Scotland. However, the idea of the UK\u0026rsquos nuclear deterrent remaining on the Clyde for 20 years would not sit well with many rank and file nationalists. \u0026ldquoIt was never credible to think that Trident would just disappear from the Clyde following a Yes vote. There are thousands of Scottish jobs that depend on it. This is another example of policy and decision-making being driven by political dogma and the SNP\u0026rsquos obsession for separation at any cost.  An SNP spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe SNP does not support Trident either as part of the UK or in an independent Scotland. We have continually opposed the renewal of Trident at the cost of conventional and cyber defences and continue to do so.  \u0026ldquoIn 2014 the Scottish Government set out a responsible approach to the removal of Trident from Scotland and in the event of independence securing the speediest and safest withdrawal of nuclear weapons would be a priority for an SNP Scottish Government."},{"url":null,"title":"no-deal-brexit-now-likeliest-outcome-says-liam-fox","story":"  Brexiter Dr Liam Fox said the odds of a no-deal Brexit had risen to 60-40, and blamed European \u0026ldquointransigence for failing to accept the UK\u0026rsquos unprecedented plans for leaving.  Opposition parties said he was trying to blame others for a mess of his own making, and warned it would be a disaster for the UK to crash out of Europe without a trade and customs relationship with the continent.  Official contingency plans suggest a no deal Brexit could choke ports, create food and medicine shortages, lead to social unrest and torpedo the economy.  Downing Street said it was \u0026ldquoconfident of a good deal, but did not disown Dr Fox\u0026rsquos remarks, which chime with its effort to sell Theresa May\u0026rsquos Chequers plan for a soft Brexit in Europe.  Last week, as part of a Cabinet drive to concentrate minds across the Channel, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned the UK and EU were heading a for no deal \u0026ldquoby accident.  Mrs May also interrupted her holiday to meet France\u0026rsquos President Macron to discuss it.  Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos top negotiator, last week trashed key parts of the Chequers plan, saying it tried to cherry pick parts of long-standing trade and customs arrangements.  Dr Fox said Mr Barnier\u0026rsquos had dismissed the proposal, which has split the Tories, simply because \"we have never done it before\", making \u0026ldquothe chance of no deal greater.  He told the Sunday Times: \u0026ldquoI think the intransigence of the [European] Commission is pushing us towards no deal. We have set out the basis in which a deal can happen.  \u0026ldquoBut if the EU decides that the theological obsession of the unelected is to take priority over the economic wellbeing of the people of Europe then it\u0027s a bureaucrats\u0027 Brexit - not a people\u0027s Brexit - then there is only going to be one outcome.\"  He said that if the EU didn\u0026rsquot like the Chequers plan it was down to them to offer one \u0026ldquoacceptable to us.

Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said no deal would be \u0026ldquoa catastrophic failure of government, which no government should survive, and MPs had a duty to prevent it.  He blamed Mrs may\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoreckless red lines on leaving the single market, customs union and European Court of Justice, Tory divisions and \u0026ldquofantasy Brexiteer promises.  SNP Brexit Secretary Michael Russell tweeted about Dr Fox: \u0026ldquoIt is not astonishing (given his political track record) but it is deeply worrying that he understands so little about the EU.

These days, it\u0026rsquos the railway that runs past the site of the former Perthshire forest that for many has come to symbolise inertia on a dramatic scale.  In 2008, the First Minister Alex Salmond promised to cut 35 minutes off the train journey between the Central belt and Inverness in four years.  Today, exactly ten years later, campaigners will highlight times have been reduced by an average of just four minutes, and two-thirds of the 118-mile Highland Main Line between Perth and Inverness remains single track.  Meanwhile, over the same decade, work has started on a \u0026pound3bn upgrade to the A9 that follows the same route.  The government quango Transport Scotland says the current aim is to deliver an average rail service lasting three hours, and a \"fastest\" of 2hrs 45 mins, by 2025.  Transform Scotland, which campaigns for sustainable transport, says the government should now make doubling and electrification of the Highland Main Line, a key connection for the far north, a top priority in its new Strategic Transport Projects Review.  The gorup\u0027s Paul Tetlaw said: \"In 2008, Alex Salmond said that within four years the rail journey time would be cut to 2 hrs 45 mins, but a decade later it averages around three and a half hours \u0026ndash yet A9 journeys are getting faster as road dualling.  \u0026ldquoThe public were told that there would be additional rail passing loops and double-tracking, but all that is being delivered is resignalling of two crossing loops.  \u0026ldquoHourly passenger trains and an average journey time saving of 10 minutes are promised but with no additional track it\u0027s highly likely we\u0027ll see more delays and cancellations as more trains are squeezed onto the single track railway.  He said the Borders Railway was a reminder single track sections meant poor performance.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government now needs to deliver serious investment in the railway to ensure there is a level playing field between road and rail.  Ian Budd, of Friends of the Far North Line, said: \u0026ldquoThe Highland Main Line is key to the whole regional rail network. Slow journey times and unreliability between Perth and Inverness have a knock-on impact on connecting trains to the Far North Line, Kyle and Elgin, and discourage people from switching from car to train.  \u0026ldquoRail travellers are entitled to see the Scottish Government deliver on its manifesto promises and make the step-change improvements which Alex Salmond announced 10 years ago.  \u0026ldquoWhat we have at the moment in no way equates with the government\u0027s stated policy.\"  David Spaven, from the Rail Freight Group, added: \u0026lsquoEveryone wants to see fewer 44-tonne trucks on the A9, but the current very limited upgrade to the Highland Main Line offers little or nothing for rail freight.  \u0026ldquoIndeed the worry is that rather than freight shifting from road to rail - the Government\u0026rsquos policy objective - we will see the loss of existing rail traffics, as the A9 gets faster and the single-track railway increasingly congested. That\u0026rsquos economic and environmental madness.  \u0026ldquoWe need longer crossing loops, so that freight trains 40 per cent longer than at present can compete much more effectively with road hauliers.  The Scottish Government said Phase 1 of the Highland Main Line improvements, increasing services from 9 to 11 per day and shaving six minutes off average trips, had been delivered.  However UK cuts meant spending was restrained.  A spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoPhase 2 is well underway and aims to deliver an hourly service between Inverness and Perth (continuing to Glasgow or Edinburgh), further journey time reductions of around 10 minutes, and more efficient freight operations by Spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoOur ongoing future investment is truly transforming the rail network and giving passengers and freight users across rural and urban Scotland the best railway they\u0026rsquove ever had.  She blamed the UK Government for a shortfall in funding for 2019-2024 of \"at least \u0026pound460 million short of early industry estimates of costs to deliver the improvements required to meet forecast future demand for services. This means our future investment decisions will need to reflect the financial climate we are faced with as a consequence of decisions taken by the UK Government."},{"url":null,"title":"grandmother-61-is-britains-longest-serving-swimming-lifeguard","story":"  Now 61, it is thought that Joy Cunningham is Britain\u0026rsquos longest serving active lifeguard.  Still working 37 hours a week over five days, the mother-of-one and grandmother of two has no plans to leave the pool, saying she intends to keep working right until she retires at 65.  Mrs Cunningham, of Rotherham, Yorkshire, said her only major scare came in November 2016, when she saved the life of an off-duty police officer who collapsed and went into cardiac arrest.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe alarm went off and I thought it was someone having an epileptic fit but it was someone having a heart attack.  \u0026ldquoI had to turn him over \u0026ndash he was blue \u0026ndash and gave him CPR and the defibrillator.

After 45 years\u0026rsquo experience, you just know.  \u0026ldquoI can\u0026rsquot see many others doing it as long as I have.  I never expected to do it this long myself.  She first became interested in swimming after obtaining a life-saving certificate as part of her Duke of Edinburgh Award.  She then saw a job advert for a recreation assistant in a local newspaper and that\u0026rsquos how she got the job.  \u0026ldquoAt the interview, they said \u0026lsquocan you start on Monday?\u0026rsquo but I hadn\u0026rsquot even left school, she added. \u0026ldquoSo I went to school in the morning and started work in the afternoon.  \u0026ldquoI never really set out to be a lifeguard, I wanted to be a swimming teacher. When I saw the advert for a recreation assistant I thought at least I\u0026rsquom getting into pool work.  Mrs Cunningham, who has been married to Stephen, 62, for 41 years, must also do regular timed swims to prove her lifeguarding proficiency \u0026ndash including a 20-metre swim and a 20-metre tow in 65 seconds, followed immediately by another 20-metre swim and a 10-metre tow in 45 seconds.  This includes a 20 metre swim and a 20 metre tow in 65 seconds, immediately followed by another 20 metre swim and a 10 metre tow in 45 seconds.

As climate change is causing alpine plants to grow at higher altitudes, Dan Watson and Paul Thomson need to take extreme action to make sure they keep their botanical knowledge up to scratch.  They are part of the National Trust for Scotland\u0026rsquos intrepid countryside experts and have just received specialist training in rope access, so they can reach never-before accessed areas and get a better understanding of the plant life that\u0026rsquos found there.  Between them they scour some of the Trust\u0026rsquos most mountainous terrain at Ben Lawers, Glencoe and Mar Lodge Estate and have recently undergone rope training and abseiling in a bid to access more inaccessible areas.  Mr Thomson said: \u0026ldquoThe main target for this work is for botanical surveys of inaccessible areas. For example, we are planning to access crags and gullies in Coire nam Beitheach at Glencoe National Nature Reserve. I monitor a number of rare plants there, but I am certain that there is much to be discovered in even more remote locations.  \u0026ldquoThere are many other locations at both of these properties that we will look at in coming years, but requests are also starting to come in from elsewhere too.  The move is seen as necessary as NTS research shows Scotland\u0026rsquos rare mountain plants are disappearing at an \u0026ldquoalarming rate.  Monitoring has revealed many fragile alpine species are vanishing from areas they used to inhabit and retreating to higher altitudes in response to global warming.  Conservationists say milder, wetter winters, drier springs and a decrease in lying snow are having an impact on plants growing on peaks. Studies at some of the country\u0026rsquos famous beauty spots have revealed major declines.  In some cases, plants have vanished from lower level locations where they had previously thrived. The tiny but fragile Arctic plants, such as Iceland purslane, snow pearlwort and Highland saxifrage, are found only in a handful of locations in the Highlands and islands, clustered in north-facing gullies, coires and crevices, frequently protected by the last pockets of late-lying winter snow.  The move into extreme monitoring comes after a large group of botanists, geologists and mountaineers spent time on ropes surveying unexplored areas of the exposed and often sheer north face of Ben Nevis in a search for similar species.  The survey on the 1,346m mountain led to the discovery of Alpine saxifrage in new locations. The plant had not been detected on Ben Nevis until a survey in 2014.  They also found new populations of Highland saxifrage, as well as the white-flowered Arctic mouse-ear, a plant native to Greenland, Iceland and Norway, and starwort mouse-ear, plus a mystery grass.  But a survey on the Burg peninsula of Mull had found the tiny annual plant was being severely hit by warmer springs, which had also led to increased growth by other plants competing for space.  On Bidean nam Bian next to Glencoe in Argyll, the latest field surveys also found a 50 per cent decline in Highland saxifrage at lower altitudes compared to the numbers detected in 1995.  Mr Watson added: \u0026ldquoOur monitoring shows climate change is affecting Scotland\u0026rsquos mountains at an alarming rate. When you see mountain plants either retreating up the hill or disappearing from their niches, it\u0026rsquos clear evidence that things are changing. The evidence is unequivocal to me that the climate is changing in the mountains."},{"url":null,"title":"geography-no-longer-just-about-books-and-maps-says-michael-palin","story":"  The veteran traveller said the \u0026ldquomagic appeal of the subject lies in exploring your surroundings and being able to \u0026ldquosee and touch and feel what the land is like.  In an interview with the Press Association, Palin said geography is a vital subject in the modern world, \u0026ldquobroadening minds and encouraging an understanding of different countries and cultures.  \u0026ldquoThe world is much more accessible, and I think it is hugely important that we understand the world and why countries are where they are, why live they how they do, what the climate is, what they produce, he said.  \u0026ldquoGeography is no longer just something which you learn from a book and a map and that\u0026rsquos it. It\u0026rsquos very much now a collaborative thing.  \u0026ldquoThe world is out there, you can go and see for yourself, very often now for very small amounts of money, what the world looks like, and I think that\u0026rsquos a great opportunity.  \u0026ldquoI think it broadens the mind \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos one obvious thing, but it also, I think it just helps us to understand how other countries are the way they are, and this is really very important in just helping us to realise that we all share the same planet and we should know more about what makes us different as well as what makes us similar.  Palin\u0026rsquos comments come as Press Association analysis shows that A-level and GCSE geography entries have risen in recent years.  In England alone, GCSE geography entries rose by more than a third (36%) between 2012 and 2017.  The increase is likely to have been fuelled by the introduction of the English Baccalaureate \u0026ndash a government measure which recognises teenagers who study English, maths, science, history or geography and a language at GCSE.  At A-level, the analysis shows that geography entries in England have risen by a fifth (21%) over the same five years.  Palin said field trips are \u0026ldquovery important, adding that this is what first got him interested in the subject.  \u0026ldquoI looked at books, I looked at maps, I looked at atlases, I enjoyed that, but the thing that inspired me most of all was being taken from the school into the local area to look at nature, to look at the way the land looked, to understand the geography, to walk up little hills and streams and see how the ecological system worked, look at the environment.  He added that he believes getting outdoors is \u0026ldquowhere the magic appeal of geography lies, it\u0026rsquos being out there, it\u0026rsquos being able to see and touch and feel what the land is like.  The writer, broadcaster and Monty Python star suggested that the reason for the rise in the popularity of the subject may be partly down to modern technology which allows people to talk to others \u0026ldquoin Argentina, or Sri Lanka, or Norway all in the same morning.  \u0026ldquoI think that helps, that stimulates the curiosity, which is a very important part of learning about the rest of the world.  He added: \u0026ldquoI think people are travelling more, and younger travellers, I think, are demanding something which I think is quite admirable, which is to go to more difficult places and very often to places where they can help in the local communities, which I think is a really important thing, because that\u0026rsquos the human side of geography which is very important."},{"url":null,"title":"which-airline-has-the-worst-punctuality-record","story":"  The Hungarian carrier\u0026rsquos UK departures were an average of 23 minutes late in 2017, according to Press Association analysis of Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) data.  Norwegian Air Shuttle has the second worst performance, followed by Vueling Airlines, Thomas Cook Airlines and BMI Regional.  The ranking features the 44 airlines with at least 2,000 scheduled flights from UK airports last year.  Average delay figures take into account every flight that operated, including those that were on time. Cancelled services are excluded from the CAA data.  Scandinavian Airlines is the most punctual, with aircraft typically taking off just seven minutes behind schedule.  Aer Lingus has the second best record, followed by Air France, Alitalia and Delta Airlines.  The average delay across all flights was 15 minutes.  A spokeswoman for Wizz Air said: \u0026ldquoA number of issues specific to the UK, including airport infrastructure, airspace congestion and slot restrictions contribute to a significantly worse on-time performance of our UK routes compared to the rest of our network.  She noted that disruption was caused by \u0026ldquoparticularly severe winter weather last year and added that the airline is taking measures to improve its punctuality, such as basing eight aircraft in the UK to reduce its exposure to inbound delays.  Norwegian Air Shuttle\u0026rsquos UK flights mainly consist of short-haul services from London Gatwick, Manchester and Edinburgh. Its average delay of 22 minutes does not take into account the majority of Norwegian\u0026rsquos long-haul flights from UK airports, which are operated by a British subsidiary.  A Norwegian spokesman said frequent air traffic control (ATC) strikes across Europe and adverse weather \u0026ldquoinvariably impact punctuality and are beyond the control of airlines.  He went on: \u0026ldquoWe do everything possible to ensure that flights operate to allow passengers to reach their destination as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoNorwegian is committed to keep improving punctuality, and where factors are within our direct control we have introduced new measures to continue delivering a smooth, efficient experience for our passengers.  The CAA said punctuality \u0026ldquoclearly matters to airline passengers and it publishes the performance of carriers to allow people to \u0026ldquomake informed choices about which airline to fly with.  Dale Keller, chief executive of airline association BAR UK, said delays are \u0026ldquoextremely costly to carriers.  Passengers on delayed flights from UK airports are entitled to assistance and compensation depending on the cause and length of the disruption.  When flights are delayed for more than two hours, airlines have to provide free access to phone calls or emails, meals and refreshments, as well as hotel accommodation if an overnight stay is required.  Passengers can also claim compensation when flights are delayed by more than three hours unless there are \u0026ldquoextraordinary circumstances such as severe weather or a security alert.  Payouts range from 250 euro (\u0026pound223) to 600 euro (\u0026pound535) depending on the length of the flight and how long it was delayed.  Editor of magazine Which? Travel, Rory Boland, advised delayed passengers to \u0026ldquomake sure you make a claim for the compensation that you are entitled to.

The bench, which would have been used by many a passenger at the old station before its closure in 1964, was recently discovered at auction and has now been secured for the project by Aberdeenshire Council and regional transport partnership Nestrans.                                                    It is hoped that following its refurbishment the bench will form part of the new station, providing a tangible link to the station’s history which was a strong theme from earlier consultation with the community.                                                    The project team are also keen to involve local organisations in the restoration work, with support already provided by haulage firm ARR Craib who assisted with transport of the bench.        The news comes soon after plans for the wider Kintore Rail Station project took a significant step forward with planning permission now granted for the platform, car park and access road. Councillor Peter Argyle, who is chair of Nestrans, deputy leader of Aberdeenshire Council and chair of their Infrastructure Services Committee, said: “I am very pleased to see the progress that has been made on the development of the station. “The discovery of the bench is most opportune and a fantastic way to involve the community and recognise their desire to see local history reflected in the new development. I look forward to seeing the bench renovated and on site at the new station.”Councillor Martin Ford, who is a member of the Garioch Area Committee and a substitute member for the Nestrans board, had highlighted the historical find at auction and added: “I am delighted that the bench has been secured and will form a point of historical interest at the new station.                                                                                                         “The area where the new station is sited has deep historical roots in transportation, going back prior to the 1800s, and you can see various signs and markers of its time as a Turnpike Road and a canal route. Whilst we do not know the exact age of the bench, it seems fitting that we can continue this tradition and link the new station back to the former site, which opened in the 1850s.” The station project is jointly funded by Aberdeenshire Council, Nestrans, and Transport Scotland via the Scottish Stations Fund, with support from Network Rail and ScotRail. It will see the construction of new station platforms, lifts/overbridge, passenger waiting shelters, a new access road, a 160 space car park, a pedestrian and cycle path and secure cycle parking facilities. The new station, which accompanies Network Rail’s Aberdeen to Inverness Improvement Project, is due to re-open to passenger services in late 2019.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Monday 6 Aug 2018 8:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

He will train youth leaders in the area to pass on the skills and techniques used in tossing the caber, tug-of-war and hammer-throwing.He said: \u0026ldquoThere are currently few routes into Highland Games for young people in Scotland.

But we are aware that this could cause difficulties for some community groups and we are asking for views on the sort of events where we should consider waiving a kitchen charge. An example of this might be an event to raise funds for the local community.”The council has said the budget simulator exercise they carried out in 2016 demonstrated a willingness among the public for an increase in charges for services if this helped reduce the need for cuts to frontline services.Initial discussions on the possibility of charging for the use of community school kitchens have been held with the chairs of many of Orkney’s community associations, who will be contacted again and asked for further feedback — including suggestions for the types of events that should be excluded from a kitchen hire charge.Other groups and individuals can also provide views and ideas by sending an email to education.leisure@orkney.gov.uk  or writing to Community Learning and Development, Council Offices, School Place, Kirkwall, Orkney KW15 1NY.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Where vacancies are going to occur, boards are already planning their recruitment processes and keeping us updated on the progress. There are absolutely no plans to merge health boards.”Orkney MSP Liam McArthur also spoke out in response to the reports, emphasising the need to consider the repercussions for island health boards.He said: “Patients in Orkney and Shetland rely heavily on these mainland boards, particularly NHS Grampian, for specialist treatment and care. Any proposals to merge NHS Grampian, NHS Highland and NHS Tayside, therefore, must take full account of the impact on island health boards.“Traditionally, rural and island communities have not fared well from the centralisation of services. They will need some convincing therefore that their interests lie at the heart of these proposals.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The ONWP is keen that people come along to find out more, and specifically what will be happening in Orkney.The events are open to the public, and it’s hoped that Orkney’s landowners will attend. Additional events will be held on the islands that Macca and Angela will be working on.The ONWP, which is a partnership between Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and RSPB Scotland, aims to protect Orkney’s native wildlife by removing stoats, an invasive non-native predator that was first recorded in Orkney in 2010.Since 2010, stoats have spread and established across Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.There have also been a handful of sightings reported on other islands including Hoy and, most recently, Shapinsay. Traps and motion-activated cameras have been used to try to determine whether stoats are present on these other islands following possible sightings. However, the presence or absence of stoats on all “high-risk” islands must be determined before the eradication programme to remove stoats can commence.Stoats are notoriously difficult to detect particularly when they are at low densities. Therefore, the only way to be certain that stoats are not present is to use specially-trained dogs to systematically search for signs and scent of stoats.Plans are in place to train six dogs as part of the main project, but, as they take years of training, Macca has been brought in from New Zealand to help confirm the presence or absence of stoats on islands that are at high-risk from stoat invasion due to their proximity to Mainland Orkney.High-risk islands are those that are within a swimmable distance of islands where stoats are established. Stoats can swim considerable distances (at least 3 km) over open water.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

track","story":"\u0026nbspMULTI-million pound efforts to improve water supplies in Ross-shire have been welcomed by a local MP.Jamie Stone visited a Scottish Water site near Evanton this week to view progress on a \u0026pound5.5 million project to improve security of the water supply for customers across much of Easter Ross and beyond.Work at the site has been underway since February this year and is expected to be complete in early 2019.A new tank is being built with a capacity to store up to eight million litres of drinking water, improving security of supply for around 30,000 customers across Easter Ross, Dingwall and the Black Isle.The work is being carried out by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD, in partnership with contractor Coffey Construction.After seeing the work in progress and receiving an update on Scottish Water\u0026rsquos current work across his Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross constituency, Mr Stone said: \"The long period of dry weather this summer is a reminder that, even in the Highlands, water is a precious resource that we all rely on in countless ways.\"The work currently taking place will help to improve the security of water supply for Easter Ross in the event of any future issues at the water treatment works or disruption to the local water network.\u0026nbsp\"At the same time, it is good to hear of the work Scottish Water\u0026rsquos operational teams are currently carrying out across the north to maintain supplies and protect the local environment.\"Despite some recent rainfall, it is still important that we use water wisely to help lochs and reservoirs recover so that supplies can be maintained through the rest of the summer and beyond,\" he added.ESD project manager Kevin Williamson said the works remained on track for completion next year.He said: \"The work we are delivering reflects a significant investment for one of the key water supply areas in the Highlands, which serves communities right around the Cromarty Firth.\"Work on site is going well and we anticipate it will be complete early next year.\u0026nbsp\"Once in place, the new storage tank will give Scottish Water improved ability to carry out important maintenance work at the water treatment works, and deal with any short term issues affecting the local water network, without impact on customers\u0026rsquo water supply.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMeanwhile, Scottish Water has urged customers to do what they can to conserve water amidst this year\u0026rsquos very dry summer.Its strategic customer service planning team Leader for the north, Jim Briggs, said: \"Separately from this longer term investment, we are continuing work in consultation with Sepa to manage water resources across the north following the prolonged period of dry weather.\"Despite some rainfall in many areas over the past week, our frontline teams are continuing to work hard to ensure we can maintain supplies to all of our customers.\"We continue to need customers to help us by using water wisely, for example by using a watering can instead of a hose in the garden and only using dishwashers and washing machines when fully loaded.\u0026nbsp\"The support of thousands of customers with these small and simple steps can make a big difference to maintaining water supplies for everyone and allowing water resources to recover when rainfall occurs.\"He added that the Evanton project will help to provide \"clear, fresh-tasting drinking water to our customers in a wide range of circumstances\".Monday 6 Aug 2018 8:37

I spoke to Cockburns and they came forward and agreed that we could have the kit fitted.\"Cockburns was the first business that we approached because we were looking for somewhere in the West End.\"The timing was just great because literally the day after they agreed to do it a nationwide campaign was launched for butchers to do the same thing \u0026ndash so Cockburns have spearheaded things.\"He added: \"This equipment is so valuable.\"Somebody that collapses outside of hospital has a six per cent chance of survival but when you have one of these kits available it can go up to around 70 per cent.\"The bank\u0026rsquos generous donation is also expected to pay for kits to be fitted in Inverness, Thurso and Kirkwall.Lucky2BeHere has a strong network of volunteer defibrillator trainers across the Highlands and Islands.It has fundraised for around 200 units so far and Dingwall now has one at the primary school, outside Castle Street Church of Scotland and Highland Council\u0026rsquos Ross House building in High Street.There are other kits in various places around Ross-shire including Contin Village Stores.And another unit is due to be fitted outside Alness Pharmacy within the next month.A nationwide campaign called \"Butchers at the Heart of the Community\" is now encouraging butchers to display collection tins in their shop in an effort to raise money for a local defibrillator.More than 30 Scottish butchers have signed up to the scheme so far, with hopes that further shops will follow suit in the future.Monday 6 Aug 2018 8:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The disastrous roll-out of universal credit that was piloted in the Highlands has resulted in vast swathes of unnecessary suffering.\"Folk, many of whom are working, are being driven into destitution and families are being left with no choice but to rely on foodbanks.\u0026nbsp\"These are political choices and it\u0026rsquos high time those in power in Westminster took responsibility for the unnecessary suffering they are causing to folk in the Highlands, and indeed across the UK.\"Ms Todd and fellow SNP MSP Kate Forbes have now opened up their office for use as a food drop-off point in a bid to encourage more Ross-shire residents to donate as organisations struggle to keep up with demand.The kind-hearted pair said constituents will be able to leave food parcels, containing non-perishable items including pasta, rice and coffee, at their office in Dingwall High Street.And they have teamed up with Blythswood Care, which runs the Highland foodbank network, in response to the news that the number of children using the Dingwall site has risen by more than 50 per cent. The facility has also been appealing for extra donations to meet demand.\"When we saw the recent plea for food bank donations, we thought this was something we could do to help,\" Ms Forbes said. \"For the first six months of the year, 40 children have received food parcels from the Dingwall food bank, which is more than a 50 per cent increase on the previous year. This is deeply concerning.\"Across the Highlands there is a 10 per cent year-on-year rise in the number of adults receiving food parcels, whilst the number is over 25 per cent for children.\"It\u0026rsquos a sign of the times that people are dependent on food donations in a rich country \u0026ndash and an indictment on welfare reform which has left people with no other choices.\"Although the total number of people across the Highlands and the number of children using food banks have both risen, the number of adults being referred to the Dingwall food bank has fallen.Blythswood Care\u0026rsquos projects manager Finlay Mackenzie spoke of his gratitude to the two MSPs for opening their office for donations.He believes families who normally receive additional support during the school term need more help during the summer holidays.He said: \"Sadly we see an increase in referrals to our food banks across the Highlands year on year.\"This summer there has been an even greater need with many families needing extra support who would usually receive free school meals and have children who attend breakfast clubs.\"Food donations usually drop during the summer but with media support we have been very encouraged by the generous donations by the public.\"We are very grateful for the support and involvement of Kate Forbes MSP and Maree Todd MSP whose backing helps to highlight the plight of local people in times of crisis.\"Monday 6 Aug 2018 8:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Local business figures have warned that caution should be taken when analysing the figures.David Richardson, Highlands and Islands development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, believes the area\u0026rsquos vast size and sparse population must be taken into account.\"Before discussing the Highlands position in the rather grisly league table one must first ask whether deaths per 10,000 people is a fair measurement,\" he said.\"The Highlands\u0026rsquo enormous size, tiny and highly dispersed population, and relatively poor public transport provision means that people here are more dependent on cars than in many other parts of the UK.\"If comparisons are being made then deaths per mile of road should perhaps be given too.\"Moreover, for much of the year the local population is massively boosted by visitors. I understand that visitors are included in the road death figures but not in the population figures, and presumably this significantly skews the results.\u0026nbsp\"Whatever the case, all deaths and injuries on roads are tragedies and it is of the utmost importance that our road network is fit for purpose for all: locals, business users, and visitors alike.\"FSB has called for increased investment for many years now, and while Highland Council\u0026rsquos recent announcement that it is allocating an additional \u0026pound1.5 million to road upgrades is extremely welcome, one has to ask if it is enough.\"Monday 6 Aug 2018 8:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It’s part of a plan by the Royal College of Nursing to attract more men into a profession where women account for 89 per cent of the workforce.            A pilot scheme is being planned where nurses of both genders will talk to pupils to give them an insight into their roles and challenge stereotypes.            The initiative, which is being drawn up by the (RCN) Students Committee, is expected to launch next year and target pupils from primary seven to S2 in Scotland.It is part of increasing efforts to boost the low number of male nurses, which have declined in Scotland, according to the latest figures.Experts say there is a need for a “rebranding” of the nursing profession to make it appealing to both sexes and challenge society’s perception of it as “women’s work”.Latest figures show men account for just 11 per cent of the nursing workforce in Scotland – with the equivalent of 6,658 full-time posts in March 2018.That figure has dropped from 6,828 in 2013.            Dr Heather Whitford, of Dundee University’s School of Nursing and Health Sciences, will be speaking at an RCN event being held later this month at Glasgow Caledonian University to discuss why men are under-represented in the profession.She said research had shown that fewer than one in ten nursing students are male.She said: “Although nursing is viewed as a worthwhile career choice, there was a perception it was a predominantly female profession.“We think positive rebranding of nursing is needed, probably at a national level.            “School education is probably a key aspect – so at pre- school, primary school and secondary school there needs to be the introduction of topics with gender-neutral images and language to try to counter the stereotypes of the kind of person who becomes a nurse.“It is a very pervasive societal view of what nursing is. It is a hard one to overcome.”The University of Dundee launched a campaign last year called #Mendocare which aims to encourage more men into nursing.The RCN event, Nursing: A Career For Men, will be held at Glasgow Caledonian University on 28 August.Theresa Fyffe, RCN Scotland director, said: “Nursing is a rewarding and exciting career and it’s really important that we encourage as many people as possible into the profession.

Eastern Western – one of the country’s biggest players – has purchased the entire share capital of Barnetts Motor Group, which represents Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo from a large single site in Dundee and also Volkswagen in St Andrews.            No financial details have been disclosed for what is likely to have been a fairly substantial multi-million-pound deal.            The Barnetts business generated sales of £65.3 million last year and returned a £1.3m pre-tax profit.The Volvo franchise will be transferred to the John Clark Motor Group, as revealed earlier this week, and in turn Eastern Western Motor Group acquires the Nissan businesses in Dundee and Perth. Nissan in Dundee will be rehoused in the showroom vacated by Volvo.Douglas Brown, group managing director of Eastern Holdings, Eastern Western Motor Group’s parent company, said: “We have known Paul Barnett for many years and as a result it has been a quick, professional and seamless transaction.“Barnetts Motor Group and the Nissan franchises in Dundee and Perth will be a great addition to the Eastern Western Motor Group.

But the reaction has been strangely hostile. Commentators, experts and some parents have ­dismissed the evidence, insisting that teachers and pushy parents are transmitting their own uncertainties to the kids and traumatised children will quickly recover. Why so harsh?            Some SNP supporters treat problems uncovered by political rivals like Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie as manufactured criticism of the Scottish Government. But there’s more.Scots have long experienced and endured hurt at an early age and although smacking’s been banned, a belief still remains that early, tough life lessons “never did us any harm”. This sits beside a deep-seated cultural belief that the three Rs should be hammered into children as ­early as humanly possible.Such withering disbelief flies in the face of the facts. Britain stands alone in ­forcing five year-olds into formal education at all. In 1870, the UK parliament chose an early school starting age so ­mothers could ­provide cheap labour in ­factories. Only 12 per cent of countries worldwide share British practice and they are all are former parts of the British Empire.Malta and Ireland, however, recently joined 66 per cent of the world’s ­countries, which start school at six. Meanwhile 22 per cent of countries including Finland, Estonia and Switzerland have a play-based kindergarten from 3-7. Perhaps that’s why they topped a recent OECD ­international review into education achievement. According to child psychologist Dr David Whitbread of Cambridge University: “Play is an adaptation which evolved in early human social groups. It enabled humans to become powerful learners and problem-solvers. “Neuroscientific studies have shown that playful activity leads to synaptic growth, particularly in the frontal ­cortex, the part of the brain responsible for all the uniquely human higher mental functions.” In short, if you stifle play you stunt personal growth.            Scotland has long talked the language of play, but remained firmly wedded to what’s ae been, with disappointing results. In 2016 Durham and York university academics found Scottish pupils from the most deprived areas were 14 months behind more affluent peers entering primary school. No amount of national testing will change that, but a move away from early “schoolification” just might. Evidence suggests that children taught literacy skills from the age of five do no ­better in the long run than those who start at seven. On the other hand, an early start at school is linked to social, emotional and mental health problems in children forced to begin formal learning before they are ready. This is why the national standardised test at five does such ­damage.Some innovative Scottish teachers have introduced a play-based approach to Primaries 1 and 2. Children’s confidence is slowly built up and a close, trusting relationship develops with the teacher. Then one day the children are handed a tablet and told to do things they have never done, for reasons they can’t understand. The children can’t step back, as they can in the rest of their play-based lives but must sit for 40 minutes until the task is completed – no matter how they feel.             Some are fine. But some are conscious of what they cannot do for the first time, trust with the teacher is broken and confidence collapses. The P1 test forces a clash between two government-backed systems – non-confrontational play and formal, rule-based education. For what?The result may not be traumatic for the majority of children but it isn’t productive either. “Baseline” tests on English five year-olds were introduced twice in the noughties and abandoned because they had “no meaningful value at such an early developmental stage”. Now Theresa May plans to introduce Scottish-style, baseline tests again, prompting the British Educational Research Association to label them “a baseline without basis”. That verdict applies to Scotland too.This is not to say all forms of testing are bad. In world-leading Finland, there is constant observational assessment by teachers who undertake individual, informal tests if there’s a problem. But they are not standardised, not national and not made before the age of six or seven because Finnish five-year-olds are still in kindergarten enjoying play-based learning. In Australia, testing has been conducted for a decade with youngsters of seven and eight – not with five-year-olds. Professor Sue Palmer, founder of Upstart Scotland, says “after ­primary four there are evidence-based arguments both ways about the value of testing. In primary one there are none at all. National standardised testing runs totally counter to the Curriculum for Excellence and nips in the bud the growing move towards play in the early years. It encourages teaching to the test, ­narrows the curriculum and changes the relationship between teachers and children – particularly damaging for disadvantaged children.”             The urge to stuff education into five-year-old brains may be understandable but it’s not rational, helpful or kind. Willie Rennie wants to abolish P1 tests. He concludes: “If [this policy] continues it will be because ministers are more interested in saving face than giving children the best start to their schooling.”It’ll be hard for the Scottish Government to admit its mistake – but harder still if progressive parents and teachers conclude that Willie Rennie is right."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4779067.1533481712!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotland s weather summer could stretch into october","story":"        Summer could last into October this year in Scotland with longer spells of \u0026#8220dry and fine\u0026#8221 weather making it a record breaker, according to the MET office.

Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday.

The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday.

And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nMonday 6 Aug 2018 8:37 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116804.jpg","title":"Beauty spot gets the all clear from SEPA","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nBadenoch and Strathspey\u0027s most popular bathing spot has been given the all-clear from blue-green algae which can make humans very ill and potentially be fatal to dogs.\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Team attended at Loch Morlich at Glenmore on Tuesday following reports of an outbreak at the beauty spot which is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people every year.\nSigns had been erected at key locations around the loch warning visitors of the potential presence of the algae.\nIt is understood that a concerned local vet raised the possibility of the algae being present after a dog took ill showing symptoms of having been in contact with blue algae following a visit to the beauty spot.\nA SEPA spokeswoman said: \"A member of our team went to Loch Morlich on Tuesday to take a sample of the algae and none could be found.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch.

As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-the-visitor-large-1.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

The agencies are to hold a joint emergency exercise near Harlosh in north Skye on 5th August.\nA joint statement by the agencies involved said: “As busy emergency service organisations we were pleased to arrange a multi-agency meeting locally to discuss partnership working and training that will benefit our local communities. It was a fantastic opportunity to meet with like-minded individuals and share information regarding our available resources and capabilities. We are looking to make this a regular occurrence which will benefit all agencies. Recruitment was also a priority for the agencies and we are keen to encourage new, keen local individuals to become part of our emergency services family. We look forward to hearing from interested members of the public who may become valuable members of the emergency services in the future.”\nAs far as the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is concerned, Mr. Colliar said anyone is welcome to drop in when training is taking place at Skye fire stations. Dunvegan, Portree, Staffin and Raasay train between 7 pm and 9 pm every Monday, as does Raasay, while Uig is on a Tuesday evening and Broadford on Wednesday. Those stations will also be open to the public on the weekend of 28th and 29th July between 10 am and 2 pm. The service is looking for retained firefighters across Skye and Raasay.\nThe Skye Mountain Rescue Team, British Red Cross and the Maritime Agency Coastguard are currently looking for volunteers and can be contacted locally or through their respective websites. The Scottish Ambulance Service is actively recruiting, and applications are through their website. Police Scotland would be keen to speak to individuals interested in the role of Special Constable locally and can be contacted at Portree police station or online via their website.\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/calmac-pic.jpg","title":"uig regeneration council to","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nHighland Council are to consult on a development brief for Uig in north Skye, which is designed to transform the area over the next 20 years.\nA key part of the strategy is to identify and coordinate regeneration opportunities which may arise from Transport Scotland\u0026#8217s investment in the Skye Triangle ferry routes, including the port facilities at Uig.\nThe consultation starts on Monday 30th July and runs until Friday 21st September.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

Historywas clearly being made.\nSomeyears later in 2004 as Sinn Féin\u0027s Northern Chairperson Iproposed we invite an ANC representative to Ireland as part of the Cúige’s Céad (centenary) celebrations.\nThe Cúigeleadership agreed.\nBy thenRonnie Kasrils was the South African Minister of Intelligence.\nSo Ichanced my arm and sent off a letter more in vain hope than any realexpectation.\nRemarkablyRonnie wrote back accepting our invitation to visit Ireland, and, would do soas a representative of Thabo Mbeki’s government.\nNeedlessto say we were delighted (and, the Cúige had just been saved a fortune of moneyin plane fares!)\nAtremendously successful programme of events was organised and Ronnie Kasrilshad a big impact everywhere he visited and spoke.\nHe andother South African comrades returned the following year to share the ANC’sexperience of transition in government as we launched the big debate within therepublican base on policing.\nVerymany comrades have vivid memories of Ronnie’s contribution to our internalpolitical discussions during this period.\nHe alsoattended and addressed Ard Fheiseanna with his then wife Eleanor and thenafter her untimely death in 2009 he wrote a brilliant book about her own rolein the liberation struggle entitled the ‘Unlikley Secret Agent’.\nHislatest book ‘A Simple Man’ is a compelling critique of current day SouthAfrica.\nRonniewas a senior figure in the collective leadership of the ANC MK, or Unkhonto weSizwe (Spear of the Nation) and the South African Communist Party, as well asa Deputy Minister of Defence, and later Minister of Intelligence in SouthAfrica.\nThe newbook provides an analysis of the ANC’s transition from resistance to powerwhich is essential reading for all political activists.\nJoeSlovo, the former MK Chief of Staff, said to Ronnie Kasrils towards the end of1994 that very few people had enjoyed the unique privilege of serving in aliberation struggle and then in government as they had.\nAs acommitted internationalist he has consistently stood in support of the peopleof Palestine, Cuba and freedom loving people across the world.\nHe hasmade an important contribution to the Basque peace process.\nAlongwith others in South Africa he has strongly supported the Irish peace process,and Sinn Féin’s work to achieve an agreed, united Ireland.\nDuringtwo speaking engagements in Belfast and Derry he kept the audiences enthralledwith his political analysis. They reciprocated with standing ovations.\nIn theGasyard centre in Derry’s Bogside he raised the roof with a funny story ofmeeting Ché Guevara in Dar-es-Salaam where he said therevolutionary icon gave a speech on armed struggle in Africa which was “bollocks”!!!\nWe helda very dignified wreath laying ceremony at Martin McGuinness’ grave, duringwhich Ronnie spoke very emotionally of Martin’s legacy, before giving amilitary salute as one freedom fighter to another.\n\nIn aseparate moment towards the end of his stay he said to me warmly: “You’ve gotthe right strategy you’ve got the right politics. The humanity of your peopleand their commitment is so tremendous.\nWe allneed to be able to draw inspiration from history, past sacrifice, leadershipand determination.\nHeroworship is something altogether different. That’s the stuff of sycophancy andthe notion that the celebration of personality is the end itself.\nThephrase that “we stand on the shoulders of giants” refers to those who have gonebefore us, but left a legacy of inspiration and leadership by example.\nThisSunday the National Hunger Strike commemoration will take place inCastlewellan, County Down.\n\nTheIrish Hunger strikers are now among a pantheon of iconic Irish andinternational figures who symbolise the struggle for a better world alongsidethe leaders of 1916 Mary Ann McCracken Nelson Mandela Ché Guevaraand Ho Chi Minh.\nBertoltBrecht the socialist poet wrote:\n      “There are those who struggle for a day and that is good\n                There are those whostruggle for a year and that is better\n                And there are those who struggle for twenty tears and that is better still\n  Then there are thosewho struggle all their lives, and they are the ones we cannot do without”\nRonnieKasrils continues to politically campaign enthusiastically for a better worldeven while approaching the autumn of his life.\nThestruggle for Irish unity, independence, and an Ireland of equals has beenenriched by his friendship and solidarity.\nSinn Féin and other progressives inIreland are proud to call him our comrade and our friend.    \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27434  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\n“The vibrant, colourful and loud message from today’s Belfast Pride parade is that the ‘north is next’ and Sinn Féin will continue to campaign to ensure that this becomes a reality.” - Megan Fearon MLA\nSinn Féin joined thousands of people on the streets of Belfast today for the annual Belfast Pride finale in solidarity with the LGBTQ community. \nThe parade – led by the Belfast Pride Festival and Mayor of Belfast Deirdre Hargey – started at Custom House Square, made its way past City Hall and through Belfast City Centre. \n\nColourful banners and floats from businesses, community organisations, political parties, emergency services and campaign groups such as Love Equality joined the procession. \nThere was a clear message from today’s parade, there is a demand for equality for the LGBTQ+ community twinned with mass opposition to the DUP’s denial of marriage equality. \n, Sinn Féin Equality spokesperson, Megan Fearon MLA said pride is a display of ‘unity and determination’ to achieve equality. \n“It’s really important that we are all together here today to fight for equality of opportunity under the law. \n“Equality for all our citizens, but especially for our LGBTQ+ brothers and sisters.

I’ve always had an imagination and this affords me the opportunity to let my imagination run wild!\n  \n“I am hoping to attract more schools to Littleworld as fairies and the trails are all about experiencing nature.\n  \n“Ipads and technology are great - but this is about getting children outdoors in the fresh air and learning about nature and their surroundings.”\n  \nSean said his family are every bit as intrigued as the public to see what he’s up to next and he laughed: “My grandson thinks his grandad’s nuts!”\n  \nSean stressed his home is open to everyone and said he often opens his curtains to see people taking pictures of his little cottage!\n  \nSean is happy to extend a warm Irish welcome to anyone who knocks on his door - even putting up a group of weary French travellers for the night!\n  \nSpeaking with Sean, his enthusiasm for his business is infectious.\n  \nHe is full of ideas, he is full of stories and he is keen to see the Glens of Antrim expand as a real tourist attraction.\n  \nIt is clear to see that each carefully sculpted design is a real labour of love, with tiny stepping stones, doors and windows housing the fairies.\n  \n\n  \nEach visitor to Littleworld will come away with their very own fairy and Sean is currently challenging those with fairies to see how far they can travel!\n  \nSo far, one intrepid little fairy has made the journey across the Atlantic to Pennsylvania, USA!\n  \nAnd nothing delights Sean more than to see the journeys these little people take as he encourages people to post pictures of the fairies’ adventures to his Littleworld facebook page.\n  \nVisitors shower their praise for Sean with one stating: “ The stunning workmanship that has been put into these houses is second to none.

John Kirkpatrick paid testament to William\u0027s character.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"65300  ","story":"                \nBALLYMONEY Foodbank has seen an almost 20% increase in usage since the introduction of Universal Credit in November 2017.\nThis is the disturbing news revealed by a Director of the local Foodbank after they recently compiled figures covering this past year. \nCo-Director of Ballymoney Foodbank Mr Peter Rawlins said: We looked at the number of vouchers dealt with, the number of people helped and the weight of food distributed in the six months leading up to November 2017 and in the five months after November 2017 (excluding December which is always a peak month for any foodbank) and we found there was an 18% increase in first five months of this year. \nMr Rawlins continued: This is a significant increase on the previous six months and on the corresponding months the previous year. Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Loughbrickland Branch looks forward to proudly representing Loughbrickland area at the event.”\n\nAs local champions of Remembrance, the Loughbrickland Branch of The Royal British Legion is looking to work in partnership with their community to bring their unique Remembrance message to the Menin Gate, on their wreath, where it will be displayed in a wreath installation for viewing by the general public until the end of August. Two schools Scarva Primary and Bronte Primary have written messages that will be attached to the wreath\n\nThe parade will start at midday and we encourage the public to make the trip across to Ypres for the August 8 and fill the Market Square to watch the parade, One Hundred Days ceremony and then enjoy an afternoon of musical entertainment including The Central Band of the Royal British Legion.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIf you want to find out more about GP90 or your local Royal British Legion branch, then visit www. britishlegion.org.uk/branches/loughbrickland or contact Loughbrickland.Secretary@rblmunity\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8529070.1533295653!/image/image.jpg","title":"remains of joint was found in the driver s seat of vehicle","story":"\nWhen police noticed the smell of cannabis coming from a car they found the remains of a joint in the driver\u0026#8217s seat, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nJustin Henderson McGowan, whose address was given as Clare Road, Tandragee, admitted unlawful possession of cannabis and herbal cannabis on May 13 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe court heard that at 8.45pm a police mobile patrol in Meadow Lane, Portadown, noticed a strong smell of cannabis coming from the defendant’s vehicle.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe remains of a joint were found on the driver’s seat and he accepted he had a grinder with a small amount of cannabis in it.

Through their images the artists strive to provide a shared unique view of our ever changing world. The connections to be found in the paintings have their origins in the subsequent years of collaboration and friendship and in the mutual understanding of contemporary art which has been formed.\n\nOn opening night a painting by Tommy was presented by the collective to the permanent collection of the Gallery. It is hoped this will provide a lasting reminder of the event and be enjoyed by visitors for many years to come. It adds to an already impressive body of Tommy’s work held in significant international collections. \n\nTommy was quick to thank all those involved, in particular curator Marijana Ramov and organiser Jasna Barisic. The whole celebration was planned with an eye to detail and on opening night the gallery was absolutely stunning. Music by Croatian duo Lucija Grabovac and Tony Vlasic provided a melodic soundtrack and complimented the occasion perfectly.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTommy believes that exhibiting internationally and presenting our artistic culture is important and it is a challenge which he relishes. We are all becoming more connected, something which we can all enjoy. Croatia is fast becoming a popular holiday destination, something which he finds completely unsurprising. Dalmatia is an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nHe considers the combination of clear blue seas, historic villages and natural cuisine a compelling mix. It is a region which he enjoys and which he hopes to visit again.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"kerri ann in limbo as she faces long wait","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA YOUNG\n Newtownabbey woman who suffers from suspected multiple sclerosis (MS) has said that “nothing in her future is certain” as she faces a possible two-year wait for treatment.\n\n24-year-old Kerri Ann Flanagan had suffered from bouts of paralysis and pain for around five years before optic neurosis claimed the sight in one of her eyes in April.\n\nAfter years of misdiagnosis, Kerri Ann was eventually referred to a neurologist and an MRI scan showed a number of symptoms linked to MS.\n\nThe MRI uncovered 10 lesions on Kerri Ann’s brain and instances of demyelination – where the cover on the nerve cells on the brain is worn away, leaving them exposed to further damage.\n\nDespite the severity of her condition, Kerri Ann could be faced with a two-year wait for treatment, and she said she’s  “absolutely terrified”.\n\n“That worry and that fear has caused me so much extra stress and anxiety,” she said. \n\n“The waiting lists are adding pressure to people who are already dealing with so much. I just feel like nothing in my future is certain any more. I had so many ideas of things I wanted to do, I was planning on getting married to my fiancé, and now I just feel like my life is on hold. I’ve been suffering from the symptoms for about five years. It has gotten worse in the last two years, especially with the pain.\n\n“When I went to A\u0026#038E with the paralysis they told me it was a migraine and sent me home.\n\n“It was awful because I knew that it wasn’t the case – I knew there was more to it. You know your own body. It was really frustrating and I felt that because of my age I was constantly being dismissed. \n\n“They were saying things like ‘Somebody your age wouldn’t have’ whatever, but there are plenty of young people who suffer from things like MS. It’s really important that they start to realise that. It was frustrating to be treated that way.”\n\nAs well as suffering some of the most debilitating symptoms linked to MS, Kerri Ann told how her condition impacts on her mental health.\n\n“It’s hard,” she said. \n\n“Since I took really ill in May and lost my sight it’s gone really downhill from there. So many symptoms keep flaring up. There are days I can’t get out of bed. It’s very unpredictable. I don’t even want to leave the house because things can change so fast. I could be fine one minute then in and hour I could lost the ability the to walk, I could fall, or my speech could be slurred. It makes me very self-conscious as well. I have had people ask if I’m drunk or on something else. I shouldn’t be embarrassed, but it’s so difficult to explain. It has just made my life so hard. My mental health has suffered terribly, not just because of the MS, but because of the pressure of the wait on an appointment. There are lots of people with different health problems, serious health problems that are in a similar situation. It’s not acceptable.”\n\nKerri Ann’s mum, Kim Flanagan, said that underfunding of the NHS was exacerbating her daughter’s condition. \n\n“In 2016 there was an MS specialist in the Royal [Victoria Hospital] who has come out on a number of occasions and said that his patients were waiting 16 months to be seen, that it was unacceptable and that it was endangering they’re health,” she said. \n\n“He said that it was down to cuts in budget. Kerri Ann will wait 12 months to see a neurologist, and then it could be a further six months or more for and MS clinic. That’s almost two years before you get a treatment plan. She has been paralysed in both legs and one arm. She has had trouble swallowing, chewing and talking, feeling like she’s on a boat or that she’s drunk. They are all symptoms of MS. She ticks so many of the boxes. We’re talking one to two years by the time a treatment plan is in place, during which time that demyelination in the brain will continue to wear away at the covers on her nerve cells – it’s more irreparable damage. Why can’t the government get back together and do something? Northern Ireland has one of the highest rates of MS in the UK, especially amongst women, and the Assembly aren’t even sitting. They are failing the people. We don’t want this publicity, but it has to be done.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Belfast Trust said: “The patient is waiting for an urgent appointment at the MS Clinic where there is currently a five month waiting time. She will see a Consultant Neurologist specialising in Multiple Sclerosis at this clinic. The patient will not have to wait 12 months to see a Neurologist before that appointment.” \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"photographer thomas is the pride of belfast media group","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nAN intimate\n retrospective of photographs chronicling 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement is set to come under the spotlight at St Mary’s University College as part of Féile an Phobail’s 30th celebrations.\nDuring his 20-plus years as a photo journalist with the North Belfast News, Thomas McMullan has captured seminal photographs depicting the darkest days of the conflict, the “early mornings and even longer days of the peace process talks” and “the lighter moments during that period”.\nHaving always had an interest in “striking images” Thomas explained how it wasn’t until his early 20s that he picked up a camera hoping to “make a living out of it”.\n“I first started off with a wee magazine in Ardoyne called Horizon, it was a community magazine and it was there that I decided I want to make a career out of taking photographs. I really loved it and I would’ve tried to take photos out of anything newsworthy,” he said.\nThomas spoke of how he approached Andersonstown News founder Basil McLaughlin and Belfast Media Group managing director Máirtín Ó Muilleoir at their West Belfast offices, who after going through his portfolio “gave me a start and that was 20 years ago.”\n“At the North Belfast News we were capturing the moment of the peace process, it was a very fraught, fragile time,” he said.\n“We were talking to prominent republicans, loyalists, peacemakers at that time. I wanted the photos to reflect on why we were going through a peace process, why we were going through a struggle for peace.”\nThomas spoke of how trying to condense 20 years worth of work down to “15, 20 photo’s” was a tough ask. “It was extremely hard to whittle down the photos, you have to be critical of your own work but I got there,” he laughed.\nThe multiple recipient of NI Provincial Press Photographer of the Year says it will be a fantastic opportunity to see his work up alongside his fellow artists when the St Mary’s Visual Arts exhibition goes live on Thursday evening.\n“This is a piece of history for me coinciding with 30 years of Féile. I’m really looking forward to seeing all the other work. I was always a member of the Christian Brother’s camera club on the Antrim Road and owe them a lot.\n“I hope those who are coming will appreciate the work.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37173473.ece/6858f/AUTOCROP/w300square/25_Rugby_rape_trial.jpg","title":"belfast pride parade","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Grammar schools dominated the top of the league tables for GCSE results achieved in 2017, taking the top 54 places.\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: Budgets for every Northern Ireland school 2018-19\n\n\n\n\nThe Belfast \u0027s league tables include data on every secondary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe top non-grammar school at GCSE in 2016/17 was St Patrick\u0027s High School, Keady (91.3%), followed by St Colm\u0027s High School in Draperstown (87.7%), and St Patrick\u0027s College, Maghera (85.9%) - just ahead of the top performing controlled non-grammar, Castlederg High School (83.3%).Overall across Northern Ireland in 2016/17, some 70.3% of year 12 pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C (or equivalent) including English and maths.\n\nThis was up 2.4 percentage points from 2015/16.\n\nPeter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar, described its joint topping of the latest league tables as a surprise 85th birthday present for the Co Down school.\n\n\"I am delighted with the phenomenal achievement of our Assumption girls at both GCSE level and A2 level,\" he said.\n\n\"The girls and the staff of Assumption have worked so hard and fully deserve this public recognition of our academic success.\n\n\"However, it is the school\u0027s \u0027Fully Alive\u0027 ethos which underpins every aspect of why Assumption Grammar is such a unique educational establishment and has been since we were first established by the Missionary Sisters of the Assumption 85 years ago this year.\n\n\"This is a surprise birthday present which will bring a smile to all our Assumption girls, past and present.\"\n\nDown High principal Maud Perry said the school was very proud of its results and she paid tribute to the hard work of pupils.\n\n\"We celebrate the many talents and achievements of all our pupils at Down High and we\u0027re very proud of the 100% pass rate at GCSE in both mathematics and English,\" she said.\n\n\"Our motto \u0027nothing is achieved without effort\u0027 reflects our belief that there is no limit to what can be accomplished through hard work.\n\n\"This hard work of staff and pupils, alongside the support of our parents, produced these fantastic results in the 2017 summer exam season.\"\n\nToday\u0027s tables also represent a triumph for south Belfast grammar school Wellington College, which scored 94.7%, significantly above the Northern Ireland average, as it works to be removed from formal intervention.\n\nPrincipal David Castles said: \"We are very proud of the excellent GCSE outcomes our students have attained. This significant improvement is part of our drive at Wellington College to raise standards, engage students and build pathways to success.\n\n\"Excellence in exams is a result of students, staff and parents working together, and these GCSE results give a great foundation for success at A-level and beyond.\"\n\nHow we did sums for the latest league tables\n\nThe Belfast  is the only source of comprehensive league tables showing the results of every post-primary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nWe obtained the data from the Department of Education for A-level and GCSE examinations sat in the 2016/17 academic year and compiled the figures into easy-to-read league tables, ordered from top to bottom. In the GCSE league tables, the Belfast  has used the percentage of pupils in the final year of a level 3 course who achieved five or more GCSEs - including English and Maths -between an A* to C grade in each school as the standard measure.\n\nThe Department of Education does not produce A-level or GCSE league tables and said it does not endorse them.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed transfer test grade intake for northern ireland schools","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In the 2016/17 academic year 11,570 applications were made for the 8,743 available places at our 63 selective grammars.\n\n\n\n\nNI Transfer Tests: 2017 Grammar Schools’ intake and grade information\n\n\nThis is out of a total of 21,763 pupils who obtained Year 8 places at Northern Ireland\u0027s 199 post-primary schools in September 2017.\n\nToday the Belfast  can reveal what grades or scores it took to get into each of our selective grammars last year.\n\nThis exclusive data was obtained over several months by sending Freedom of Information Act requests to each of the selective grammars.\n\nCurrently there are no official figures provided by the Department of Education, because both the Post Primary Transfer Consortium\u0027s GL assessment and the Association of Quality Education\u0027s (AQE) Common Entrance Assessment are unofficial tests.\n\nOur data for tests sat in the 2016/17 academic year reveal:\n\n\nFive schools which use the AQE system did not accept a score below 100 in September 2017.\n\nFive schools which use the GL system did not accept a grade below an A in September 2017.\n\n30 schools accepted AQE scores, while 26 accepted GL scores, and seven took either.\n\nLagan College, which is partially selective, was the most popular first choice by far, with 456 applications for 200 places.\n\nFriends School Lisburn was one of the toughest schools to get into last September - the lowest score it accepted was 106 (AQE).\n\nThree of the 63 selective grammar schools were not oversubscribed.\n\nThe AQE and GL tests received a total number of 14,491 entries in the 2016/17 academic year - 7,725 sat the AQEs and 6,766 sat the GL tests. An unknown number of pupils sat both tests.\n\nThere are 199 post-primary schools in Northern Ireland, of which 63 are grammars that use academic selection for all or some of their Year 8 intake.\n\n\nLeaders in the AQE and GL organisations told the Belfast  that their entry rates have been steadily increasing over the last decade following the abolition of the old Department of Education-administered 11-plus by former Education Minister Caitriona Ruane in 2008.\n\nAQE chief executive Stephen Connolly said the number of entrants to the test is continuing to rise, with 8,169 pupils registered for the 2017 AQE tests, a rise of almost 6% on 2016 (7,725).\n\nMr Connolly said he can only speculate on the increase, but said he believed it may partly follow a decision by former Education Minister Peter Weir to allow primary schools to prepare pupils to sit transfer tests. That reversed a ruling by his predecessor John O\u0027Dowd, which saw schools receive warning letters from the department over preparing pupils for tests within school hours.\n\n\"That reflects a number of things, that is the steadily increasing primary school age population, also a backwash from the former minister taking the shackles off primary schools and allowing them to openly prepare pupils for transfer tests, and also word of mouth from parent to parent,\" he said. There was also an increase in the number of pupils who sat the PPTC\u0027s GL test, from 6,766 in the 2016/17 academic year to 7,150 in 2017/18.\n\nCarol McCann from the PPTC said parents remained very supportive of the tests.\n\n\"More than 30 schools use the GL test and it is used by a variety of types of school, including grammar and bilateral,\" she said.\n\n\"A number of PPTC schools also register pupils for the AQE test. Regarding the increase in the number of pupils sitting the test in 2017 for entry to post-primary in 2018, it is most likely as a result of a rising primary school population in a number of areas.\n\n\"It is very evident that the transfer test continues to be supported by parents in Northern Ireland who believe in educational choice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, talks between the two transfer test providers to create a single system of assessment remain \"ongoing and positive\".\n\nThe AQE and PPTC aim to have a common test in place by November 2019. Mr Connolly said that talks are continuing but the end goal is very complex, and they want to ensure any new single system is robust, will have the confidence of parents, and is of an international standard.\n\n\"The two negotiating teams made a very good decision at the outset to keep it confidential to not raise expectation or increase pressures and making sure the goodwill between us in this difficult process is maintained,\" he said. \"Trying to put together a single system is very difficult.\n\n\"I think it is very important that both groups think it is a matter of principle there should be one system.\n\n\"That principle has been agreed, but getting there is tricky simply because of the complexity of the two systems. People need to have confidence in schools, but also in the testing system.\n\n\"It needs to be reliable, robust and meet international standards. It isn\u0027t just a race to cobble together any old compromise, we are engaging in careful negotiation.\" Results for both tests are due to be released to pupils this Saturday.\n\nHow the figures are compiled\n\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) legislation we asked the grammar schools in Northern Ireland which use academic selection to determine their Year 8 intake to provide the breakdown of the AQE/GL grades/scores achieved by the pupils they admitted in September 2017.\n\nThe data gives schools’ name, location, the highest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted and the lowest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted.\n\nOther information included is the number of first preference choices it received and total applications (which includes first, second, third choices etc).\n\nSeveral schools have provided bands for the lowest and highest scores they accepted, as this is the method they used to select pupils. Some schools accept both AQE and GL scores.\n\nNot all schools use academic selection to determine their entire intake. Wallace High School in Lisburn admits around 90% of its Year 8 intake on test results Campbell College in Belfast admits 70%, while Lagan College in Belfast and Slemish College in Ballymena select 35% of their pupils using test scores. Some other schools also use additional criteria to separate students with the same score vying for the final places. Two voluntary grammar schools, Loreto College in Coleraine and St Patrick’s Grammar in Armagh, no longer use academic selection.\n\nTotal pupil figures do not tally for a number of reasons, which can include pupils with a statement of special educational needs not being included in enrolment figures, and some pupils being accepted through special circumstances or on appeal.\n\nIn some schools pupils were admitted without using academic selection and some schools were undersubscribed.\n\nWhen comparing schools, the size should be taken into account. For example Glenlola Collegiate in Bangor has an annual Year 8 intake of 157 pupils. Its principal Mr W E Thompson pointed out that the 157th pupil they accepted in September 2017 scored 85 in the AQE test, but in the North Down area there are smaller selective grammars which accepted only 100 pupils.\n\nHe has asked us to point out that the 100th pupil Glenlola accepted scored 98 in the AQE tests.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"75m rooftop running track plan for old belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast pride parade 2018 thousands take to streets to celebrate","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself.

The petition period will run from this Wednesday, August 8, to September 19.\n\nThe DUP has been asked if party members attending Mr Finlay\u0027s meeting on August 13 will face sanction but it has yet to respond.\n\nOne Ballymoney DUP councillor, Ian Stevenson, said Mr Paisley had his \"full support\" but declined to say if he would attend Mr Finlay\u0027s meeting.\n\n\"An election would be a needless waste of money but of course others will play politics,\" he said. \"He has apologised and been disciplined by Parliament. \n\n\"He is highly regarded within the North Antrim DUP Association and by the electorate, particularly for his hard work on behalf of his constituency. \n\nHe added: \"There is a strong feeling that the Press and nationalism seem to focus heavily on the DUP, whilst treading gently in regards to Sinn Fein, with the full history that they have.\n\n\"Regarding any meeting or any other internal DUP business, I wish to make no comment on this.\"\n\nIndependent Glens councillor Padraig McShane, however, called Mr Paisley \"damaged goods\" and said it was unwise for DUP councillors to support him in public.\n\n\"After accepting the free holidays in Sri Lanka, I don\u0027t think Ian Paisley has any authority to speak on behalf of anybody,\" he said. \"I work with John Finlay in the council and a number of committees. I would suggest to him that the public will judge Mr Paisley and he\u0027d be best staying away from it.\n\n\"It\u0027s hard to know if Ian Paisley will survive the recall petition, to me it seems insurmountable.\n\n\"I think he put himself before the public. So for anybody stepping out to support Ian Paisley at this stage, I would say it\u0027s curtains for them as well.\"\n\nMr Finlay\u0027s letter encouraging support for Mr Paisley, which has been seen by the Belfast , said the \"media frenzy\" over the scandal had caused him \"great sadness\".\n\nIn it he said that many saw this as their chance to oust \"Northern Ireland\u0027s most gifted voice in Parliament on Brexit\". \n\nIt added: \"They also see it as an opportunity to rid themselves finally of Paisley\u0027s voice in defence of the Union and on the Biblical moral issues such as same-sex marriage and abortion.\"\n\nThe letter said the planned meeting with Mr Paisley would \"show the world that the friends of Ian Paisley still stand behind the man they believe in, good times and bad\".\n\nLast week, it emerged that Mr Paisley\u0027s party affiliation has been changed to \u0027independent\u0027 on Parliament\u0027s website following his suspension from the DUP.\n\nA House of Commons spokesperson said the change of status was a reflection of the fact he is suspended, and does not mean Mr Paisley has left the party. \n\nIt is understood the action was taken by the House of Commons without contact from the DUP. Similar action has been taken with other parliamentarians suspended from their parties.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup tries to block northern ireland council flying pride flag","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, no meeting is scheduled before Saturday\u0027s parade. Calls have now been made for a special meeting of the council on Friday. If that does not happen, then the flags will not fly.\n\nThe \u0027call-in\u0027 move comes after a notice of motion brought by Sinn Fein on flying the flags narrowly passed 12-11 at a full council meeting last Monday evening. DUP councillors voted against the motion while the Ulster Unionists abstained after their amendment recommending that council buildings be lit in the pride colours instead was rejected.\n\nA council spokesperson confirmed the \u0027call in\u0027 had been received.\n\nSinn Fein group leader on the council Darren McNally slammed the DUP for trying to prevent the flying of the Rainbow flag.\n\n\"The move by the DUP to call-in Sinn Fein\u0027s motion to fly the rainbow flag at civic buildings across the area is disgraceful and disrespectful to our LGBTQ+ community,\" he said. \"This call-in came in the final hour - and is an effort to run down the clock on gaining legal advice and securing a special meeting of the council before Saturday.\"\n\nMayor of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Julie Flaherty confirmed: \"The call-in was received on Tuesday morning and it\u0027s now in the hands of the Chief Executive. That\u0027s where we\u0027re at as things stand.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate development, Barnardo\u0027s has become the first children\u0027s charity in Northern Ireland to publicly voice support for the recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nIt made the announcement to coincide with Belfast Pride\u0027s Coming Out for Change campaign, and just days before the city\u0027s Pride parade.\n\nBarnardo\u0027s has in the past supported marriage equality campaigns in other areas of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe director of Barnardo\u0027s NI Lynda Wilson said it hoped to see marriage equality extended to Northern Ireland.\n\n\"We are committed to providing equality of opportunity and believe marriage equality is an extension of that,\" she said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"graffiti artist brings splash of colour to fermanagh","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The bales are still used, they still carry out their function so essentially it is ephemeral art. \n\n\"Once the cows need the feed the bales are chopped up and fed to them and the art disappears. We did some last year and a couple of the farmers decided to keep them. They liked them so much.\n\n\"This time I\u0027ve done a couple of sets which were very abstract forms, just colours and strange stuff. People have been responded really positively, thinking it\u0027s great. People were so nice, I was well looked after in Fermanagh.\n\n\"Local farmers have been very supportive of the project and are really embracing the colourful bales which make up part of their working day. People are really loving them, from old age pensioners to young kids. They are coming along and getting their photographs taken.\"\n\nKev has even bigger plans to bring his unique brand of colour to the rural landscape.\n\n\"One of the people I met on my adventures in Fermanagh has this massive big container which he is turning into accommodation,\" he said. \"He wants me to paint on that. It\u0027s huge. \n\n\"I also have my eye on a few barn walls on which to paint on. And I am also planning on doing another project with cellophane, wrapping it between two trees and creating a clear wall to fashion a kind of countryside mural.\" \n\nKev\u0027s latest work can be viewed in Aghadrumsee and along the A4 just outside Brookeborough in Co Fermanagh. \n\nYou can find Kev on Twitter at @KVLR1\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

One of the best parades I\u0027ve been to. Very positive.\"\n\nMr Beattie also paid tribute to party colleague Jeff Dudgeon, whose determined campaigning was crucial in forcing the liberalisation of Northern Ireland\u0027s anti-gay laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople taking part in the Belfast Pride parade set off from Custom House Square in central Belfast. Michael Cooper/PA Wire\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd he said he looked forward to the day when the party would itself take part in the Pride event. \n\n\"We\u0027ve been slow,\" but we\u0027ve changed,\" he added.\n\nOrganisers said they had noticed a rise in corporate bodies wanting to associate themselves with the festival.\n\nMr Nesbitt said Belfast Pride had become more self-assured than ever.\n\n\"It was a very positive day with a huge number of people taking part,\" the former UUP leader said. \"I haven\u0027t witnessed a Pride event for a long time and I sensed a huge change in the atmosphere.\n\n\"A long time ago it was a lot less confident, with organisers and participants feeling they had to be a lot more in your face.\n\n\"Saturday was just a celebration and I felt everyone taking part were beyond having to prove themselves.\"\n\nHe added: \"The other big difference I noticed was the number of private companies and public bodies throwing their support behind it all.\"\n\nThe first Belfast Pride parade held in 1991 attracted a small crowd of just around 100.\n\nTaking part for the second year in a row were officers in uniform from both the PSNI and An Garda Siochana.\n\nMembers of the NI Ambulance Service also took part in the celebrations.\n\nA Marks \u0026 Spencer employee in Bangor called Steven was congratulated on social media by his employers after proposing to his partner Sam at the event, surrounded by his colleagues.\n\nAs Northern Ireland remains the only part of the UK and Ireland not to legalise same-sex marriage, many campaigners still view Pride as a protest.\n\nThe Love Equality campaign has called on the Prime Minister Theresa May to change the law. Patrick Corrigan, NI director of Amnesty International, said: \"Pride is always the most colourful day of the year in Belfast.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37186170.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Mary_Lou_McDonald_Castlewellan.jpg","title":"the time for irish unity referendum is near sinn feins mcdonald","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The need for a referendum to end partition is writ large.  The time for a Unity Referendum is drawing near. It is not a question of if a unity referendum will happen but a question of when.\"\n\nMrs McDonald said British Identity \"can and must be accommodated\" in a united Ireland.\n\n\"As Britain turns away from Europe, the appeal of being part of a new and outward-looking Ireland will, I believe, prove ever more attractive to some within the unionist community,\" she said. \n\n“British identity can and must be accommodated in a united Ireland and I believe nationalist Ireland is open to constitutional and political safeguards to ensure this.\"\n\nThe Sinn Fein leader said her party was committed to re-establishing the Executive, which collapsed last January. \n\nThe Irish and British governments have said there will be a new round of talks in autumn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA procession during the 37th National Hunger Strike Commemoration in Castlewellan, County Down, Northern Ireland.

They are for all in society. \n\n“Marriage equality, the right to inquests and language rights are for everyone.\n\n“Fifty years on from the civil rights movement, sections of political unionism still resist equality and rights, but they will not succeed.\n\n“It is not sufficient for the two governments to only call a talks process.

The march in Castlewellan was attended by Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald.It marks the anniversary of the deaths of 10 republican hunger strikers, including Bobby Sands and Raymond McCreesh in 1981.In previous years tens of thousands of republicans have attended the event, which changes location annually.Relatives of IRA victims have accused Sinn Fein of \"insulting\" their loved ones memories, saying the commemoration compounds their grief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latter, she continued, had a responsibility to take a lead on the process.\n\n\"Political leaders must begin practical preparations for a new, inclusive Ireland beyond partition,\" she added.\n\n\"We are entering a defining period in Irish political history.\n\n\"Change is coming and it must be managed, sensitively and imaginatively.\n\n\"A process of national reconciliation must be central to any genuine effort to unite the people of this island.\"\n\nAddressing the ongoing Brexit fallout, Ms McDonald said Remainers within the unionist community would be increasingly attracted to being part of a \"new and outward-looking Ireland\" as the UK continues to \"turn away from Europe\".\n\nShe also reiterated Sinn Fein\u0027s commitment to forging a united Ireland that would accommodate unionists and their culture.\n\n\"British identity can and must be accommodated in a united Ireland and I believe nationalist Ireland is open to constitutional and political safeguards to ensure this,\" insisted the party leader.\n\n\"The right of unionists to celebrate their history and tradition, to recount their experiences and suffering, and to remember and honour their dead must be, and will be, respected.\"\n\nAnd to claps and cheers, she added: \"Just as our right to remember, to commemorate and honour our dead will be respected.\"\n\nMs McDonald also stressed that the party would continue to build on its equality agenda in the event of Irish unity as she laid out Sinn Fein\u0027s vision.\n\n\"It will be an Ireland united and at peace with itself. It will be a successful, prosperous Ireland of opportunity for all, regardless of class, colour, religion, gender or sexual orientation,\" she told the crowd.\n\nReasserting her party\u0027s commitment to seeing the Executive and Assembly restored, Ms McDonald said the political stalemate could only be overcome if progress is made on a number of social issues, such as the extension of same-sex marriage legislation to the North, which the DUP is strongly against.\n\n\"Marriage equality, the right to inquests and language rights are for everyone,\" she insisted.\n\n\"Fifty years on from the civil rights movement, sections of political unionism still resist equality and rights, but they will not succeed.\n\n\"It is not sufficient for the two Governments to only call a talks process. They must bring something to the table. They need to make clear that agreements must be implemented in full.\"\n\nMs McDonald added that the DUP\u0027s \u0027confidence and supply\u0027 agreement with the Tories continued to be a sticking point in getting the Assembly\u0027s institutions restored.\n\n\"We are dealing with a British Government that is dependent on DUP votes and sees Ireland as collateral damage in their desire to remain in office,\" she added. \"That is why we need a strong Irish Government leading on these issues.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"funding boost for island improvement projects","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There was applause from mourners as she arrived for the funeral of Martin McGuinness last year.\n\nIn a memorable image from the funeral, Mrs Foster and Sinn Fein\u0027s Michelle O\u0027Neill were photographed reaching out to shake hands among a sea of mourners.\n\nIt is not known if Mrs Foster will attend the papal Mass as no one from the DUP was available for comment yesterday.\n\nMeanwhile, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says he will express his concerns to the Pope about the Catholic Church\u0027s involvement with sexual and physical abuse during his visit.\n\nThe Taoiseach also said he intended to tell Pope Francis that Ireland accepts gay parents. As part of his visit, the pontiff will go to the Capuchin Day Centre for the homeless in Dublin and Knock Shrine. However, it is not yet clear whether he will meet victims of clerical abuse.\n\nMr Varadkar said that while his meeting with the Pope at Dublin Castle could be short, he will express his concerns about issues such as the Catholic Church\u0027s involvement in Magdalene Laundries.\n\n\"I\u0027m really glad the Pope is visiting Ireland, the visit is very welcome,\" Mr Varadkar said.\n\n\"I will certainly want to express to him the real concerns that Irish people have on the legacy of the past, in relation to issues such as the Church\u0027s involvement in Magdalene Laundries, in mother and baby homes, and sexual and physical abuse, and relay that to him.\n\n\"And also our views in society and the government\u0027s view that families come in all sorts of different forms, and that includes families led by same-sex parents, and one-parent families as well.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"irish hockey team praised after loss in world cup final","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

That is welcome.\n\n“However basic rights, respect and equality cannot be disregarded, they are not bargaining chips.\n\n“They are for all in society.\n\n“Marriage equality, the right to inquests and language rights are for everyone.\n\n“The way to unlock the political process is to make clear that rights enjoyed in the rest of Ireland and across Britain will be implemented in the north.”\n\nMs McDonald added there are more Republicans across Ireland now than at any time since partition.\n\n“The tide of history is with those who seek a united Ireland.\n\n“It is increasingly clear that the partition of Ireland is an obstacle to building a modern, open and forward-looking society.\n\n“Brexit and the prospect of a hard border are further exposing the fact that a divided Ireland does not serve the needs of our people.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"hsbc banks increased profits as it kickstarts new strategy","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

has boosted its profits as it pushes ahead with the strategy put in place by new chief executive John Flint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nThe lender has reported pre-tax profit of 10.7 billion US dollars (£8.2 billion) for the half-year ended June 30, up from 10.2 billion US dollars (£7.9 billion) for the same period in 2017.\n\nAdjusted pre-tax profits fell from 12.4 billion US dollars (£9.6 billion) to 12.1 billion US dollars (£9.3 billion), which HSBC said was due to hiring more staff and expanding its digital network.\n\nThe bank’s revenue for the period was 27.3 billion US dollars (£21 billion), up 4.2% year on year from 26.2 billion US dollars (£20.2 billion).\n\nHSBC also announced that Jonathan Symonds, who is currently chairman of HSBC Bank, will become deputy group chairman of HSBC Holdings.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMr Flint, HSBC’s group chief executive, said: “HSBC is a strong business with a number of clear commercial advantages.\n\n“In particular, we are a leading international bank with a network that gives us unparalleled access to high-growth markets, particularly in Asia and the Middle East.”\n\nHSBC said in June that it was aiming to simplify its business, while also investing billions in technology under Mr Flint, who was appointed chief executive earlier this year.\n\nThe lender released an eight-point plan, saying it will look to boost growth across its Asia business, complete the ring-fencing of its UK bank, boost its share of the mortgage market and improve customer service.\n\nMark Tucker, HSBC’s group chairman, said: “We have created a strategy that builds on past achievements to improve the group’s competitiveness and increase value for shareholders.\n\n“It focuses on areas where HSBC is already strong, but which also hold the greatest capacity for revenue growth and value creation.”\n\nJasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said the results from HSBC, Europe’s biggest bank, made for a positive start to the week for European markets.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"a young artist shared the fruits of their practice and gained a bunch of internet fans","story":"\n

Its Funny to Remember how Proud I was of the First One.\n from \npainting\n \n\n\n\nReddit users loved the pictures. User Ellibur commented: “The first one is really cute, be proud of what you accomplished then, be proud of your hard work and the progress you’ve made! Of course your new painting looks amazing as well. Keep it going!”\n\nSo how did Brant get better at painting?\n\nFirst of all, they ditched the watercolour paints and invested in acrylic paint instead.\n\n“I think that this is a good lesson when you go about creating art because it is good to explore the properties of various mediums in order to find which best suits your personal style, they said.\n\n“For instance, ink, and graphite can provide much more detail and can be handled easier than paint. However paint provides much more colour possibilities.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Brant Georgia/PA)\n\n\n\n\nBrant also began taking lessons with a local artist to hone their skills and used Bob Ross as inspiration.\n\n“Often people are afraid of taking lessons because they think that they aren’t skilled or talented enough to even be taught,” they said.\n\n“I felt this way when I started painting as well. I often referred to a quote by the landscape painter, Bob Ross: ‘talent is a pursued interest.’ Bob believed that anyone could learn to paint, it was just a matter of picking up the brush for the first time.”\n\nBrant has a lesson for anyone interested in a creative pursuit.\n\n“Just start making art.\n\n“It doesn’t matter whether you’re good or bad at the beginning, you will always be improving over time if you are determined and keep painting or practising your craft.\n\n“Whether or not someone is talented or not does not mean that not everyone can create something. I believe that everyone has the need to be creative in some way and they have the ability to create something.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"people are sharing the tiny acts which make them love their partner and its serious goals","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

entries to date as well as 40 plus relay teams of three which is a big increase on last year and indicates that the individual limit will be reached soon,” he revealed.\n\n“The NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships and qualification for the Commonwealth Championships is a big carrot for the top male and female entrants to aim for and this should add to the quality of the field and the up front competition on the day.\n\n“The event sells out every year and with the continued growth of athletics and running clubs locally our advice to anyone intending to take part is to register online now to avoid disappointment when entries close on August 13\nth\n.”\nThe Waterside Half Marathon is one of the longest running athletics events in Ireland with a scenic route that takes in both sides of the River Foyle, passing many of the city’s historic landmarks including its famous walls and the Guildhall.\nThe 13.1 mile course has runner, wheelchair and three person relay categories, the event is open to athletes of all levels and abilities and all entrants to the main race must be aged 17 or over on race day.\nA number of groups have already registered for the event to raise funds for their chosen charities including a group of over 20 runners from Firstsource Solutions in Derry who are taking part in aid of Foyle Search and Rescue.\nThe event includes a team of 12 pacers who will be identifiable at the race start by helium balloons displaying their times.\nPacer times start at 1 hour and 30 minutes and rise in increments of 15 minutes up to 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n“The pacers are all experienced runners who have studied the terrain of the course beforehand and they have always been spot on with their timings,” Gerry explained.\n“The beauty of having different pacers is that if peoples’ goals change during the race they have the option to slow down or speed up to join the pacers behind or in front.\n“Pacers will be walking around the start line for half an hour before the race and will be identifiable by helium balloons and t shirts showing their time so runners can file in behind them at the race start.”\n“It’s a spectator friendly route with the start and finish at St Columb’s Park and people can stand anywhere along the river bank on the west bank and enjoy the action.\n“Between the Peace Bridge and Coshowen runners will be running in both directions so that is a particularly good place to enjoy the action.”\nAll participants will receive a specially commissioned Waterside Half Marathon medal and race t shirt.\nEntries to the race close at midnight on Monday 13\nth\n August 2018 and you can register online now
