Hope your kids are ok @roadsidemum.\u0027She added: One of the reasons why some schools have used food parcels rather than vouchers is that it helps keep them in touch with families.\u0027Very sadly during the pandemic there has been an increase in risk to some children. Do call @NSPCC if you are concerned about a child.\u0027Naomi Willis from Skint Dad commented: \u0027While it seems that some food parcels have been good quality, there is a distinct lack of consistency, compared to the previous voucher scheme.\u0027The food parcels provided to parents in the current lockdown should be able to feed a child for a week, but what we\u0027ve seen shared by Skint Dad community members falls far short of this and is clearly not good enough.\u0027This is adding additional pressure to struggling parents and is letting down children who are caught in the middle.\u0027The scheme needs to be reviewed immediately to ensure that all children are provided with enough food or reintroduce the previous voucher scheme today.\u0027Parents said the meals were dished out to children studying from home by a private contractor.Government guidance for the free school meals scheme says institutions can apply for an extra £3.50 per student on top of whatever they receive. It says: \u0027We strongly encourage schools to work with their school catering team or food provider to provide food parcels to eligible free school meal pupils who are at home.\u0027 It adds: \u0027Where school kitchens are open this should be the approach taken by schools.\u0027Chartwells said this morning: \u0027We take our responsibility to provide children with access to nutritious food very seriously.\u0027We have worked hard to produce food hampers at incredibly short notice during these challenging times.\u0027Our hampers follow the DofE specifications and contain a variety of ingredients to support families in providing meals throughout the week.\u0027In the majority of instances, we have received positive feedback.\u0027In this instance, the image on Twitter falls short of our hamper specification and we are keen to investigate with the relevant school so we can address any operational issues that may have arisen.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"South African variant coronavirus taking root UK experts claim","story":"Share this article They claimed it shouldn\u0027t become the dominant variant in the UK because it only \u0027slightly\u0027 more infectious than the Kent version, so it has no \u0027evolutionary edge\u0027. Scientists fear the South African version will make vaccines redundant or less potent because it has key mutations on its spike protein.But experts are still carrying out tests to confirm whether it can evade antibodies triggered by the jabs and say it will take several weeks before this becomes clear.  The UK is monitoring the variants spread through its huge diagnostics arm including labs at the Covid-19 Genormics UK Consortium (COG-UK).Experts sift through 10 per cent of all positive swabs carried out and sequence their genomes to identify which strain has been detected.The strain can only be identified through sequencing the genomes of samples — which would then reveal whether it had the tell-tale mutations.But only a fraction of positive tests are sent on to COG-UK for further investigation, meaning the South African variant could be spreading more widely.Standard PCR tests that diagnose Britons with Covid cannot spot the South African strain because it looks too similar to the original variants.The Kent variant, however, is much easier to track because it can be spotted through the standard swabs due to its genetic make-up, experts say. The UK had recorded two cases of the variant by December 23, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed just before Christmas.One was detected in London and the second in the North West. They had both been in contact with someone who had previously travelled to South Africa. Experts warned, however, that this was likely to be \u0027just the tip of the iceberg\u0027.But since then officials have declared no new cases of the variant, although scientists admit is is a \u0027difficult task\u0027 to track them. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned last week the current wave of jabs might not protect against the South African strain of coronavirus.Mr Shapps said introducing a mandatory test and release system for travellers coming into the UK had become \u0027much more urgent\u0027 because of the threat the variant poses to Britain\u0027s mass vaccination programme. The UK has made it compulsory for travellers to test negative when they arrive in the country in a bid to keep the viciously-infectious strain out. Flights to and from South Africa have also been banned.Mr Shapps told Sky News: \u0027This is an extra check and we\u0027re doing this now because there are these variants that we\u0027re very keen to keep out of the country, like the South African variant, for example.\u0027There are the concerns about the South African one in particular about how effective the vaccine would be against it so we simply cannot take chances. So today because of that variant it has become much more urgent.\u0027A study by Pfizer suggested last week, however, that their vaccine may provide immunity against a mutation on the South African strain.But their work hasn\u0027t been peer-reviewed by scientists and missed several of the key mutations on the strain including the concerning E484K change yet to be detected in the UK but that seems to help the virus to disguise its spike protein."},{"url":null,"title":"Inauguration ring steel Tough security measures place","story":"   After Biden is officially inaugurated, he, Vice President Kamala Harris and their spouses will lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery.They will be joined there by former Presidents Barack Obama, George W.

The effects of the England lockdown are only now filtering through in data as the Department of Health today announced 45,533 positive tests, which is the lowest figure since December 29. The average infection rate in East of England dropped from a peak of 856 per 100,000 people on January 4 to 741 by January 7, the most recent data for the seven-day average.In London, it fell from 1,116 to 1,005 over the same period, in the South East from 774 to 679. All three regions were mostly or totally in Tier 4 for two weeks before lockdown began.In areas with the lightest rules, however, cases continued to surge late into the year and, despite almost the entire country getting tougher rules on boxing day, continued to rise into the start of lockdown, with some still going up.In the North West, the infection rate was 582 per 100,000 on January 4 and rose to 607 by January 7. In the South West, the rate remained at 385 during the same period.Professor Paul Hunter, a medicine lecturer at the University of East Anglia, said the dropping rates were \u0027promising\u0027 but that he \u0027wouldn\u0027t crack open the champagne just yet\u0027. He told MailOnline: \u0027Unless there is a glitch in the figures to get us all excited just to dash our hopes in three days time, this is looking very good.\u0027He warned the falling infection rate after January 4 may be because the national shutdown discouraged Britons suffering symptoms of the virus from getting tested, artificially driving down the number of cases early.Data doesn\u0027t support this, however, with more than half a million tests per day being carried out on all but one of the days since England went into lockdown and the average still rising.But Professor Hunter pointed to England\u0027s Covid-19 hospitalisations data, with the daily number of admissions appearing to plateau by January 7 at almost 4,000 a day, suggesting infections may have peaked before lockdown.This is because it takes roughly two weeks for someone who is infected with the virus to develop symptoms severe enough to be hospitalised, meaning infections may have initially begun to plateau after Christmas.He said: \u0027In the last seven days we had 2,000 fewer cases reported than in the previous seven days.\u0027It\u0027s a possible hint that things might be already on the decline... I wouldn\u0027t quite crack open the champagne just yet and there\u0027s nothing stopping that going the other way. \u0027Unless this is something by some evil genius with a warped sense of humour who wanted to get us all excited just to dash us against the rocks in three days\u0027 time, it is looking very good.\u0027 Breaking Kent down into its 13 boroughs reveals 12 saw their Covid-19 infection rates peak on January 4 and then come down afterwards.But in Sevenoaks it peaked two days earlier – on January 2 – when it reached 871 per 100,000.The highest infection rate in the county was recorded in Dartford, near London, on January 4 when it hit 1,302 per 100,000.The county was plunged into Tier 4 only three weeks before most boroughs peaked – with gyms and so-called non-essential shops forced to close – which is around the time  that experts say is needed to show whether the measures are working.There were mounting concerns that the highest tier, which had left schools open, was failing to control the more infectious coronavirus variant from Kent. Although the latest figures suggest the fear may be unfounded.They paint a stark contrast to the situation in Liverpool, which was left in Tier 2 measures and only pushed into Tier 3 on December 30 after the Government held it up as an example of how to handle an outbreak.The area saw infections surge by 88 per cent in the seven days to December 30, and 148 per cent in the following week to January 6 reaching a high point of 960 per 100,000. Number 10 now faces the prospect of having to tighten the screw even further on England\u0027s lockdown, in a last-ditch attempt to try to thwart the spread of the super-infectious new variant.The Prime Minister today held a virtual meeting with his senior team as they considered their next move, with takeaways, click-and-collect services and the allowance for meeting up one-on-one to exercise thought to be next in the firing line. No10 said Mr Johnson \u0027re-iterated the need to bring the transmission rate of the virus down given the pressure that the NHS now faces\u0027.Sources told MailOnline the PM hopes to avoid going further this week, with the effects of England\u0027s third national lockdown only just starting to feed into the daily infection figures. But ministers have made clear they are ready to get even tougher, with leading figures on SAGE pushing for a three metre social rule distancing rule, and threats to axe the loophole allowing people to exercise with a friend from another household.Nicola Sturgeon said today that she was mulling harsher limits on click and collect shopping in Scotland, as well as tightening the rules on takeaways. She is expected to announce any changes tomorrow.The Government has been desperately pleading for people to limit their contacts and stay at home as the health service struggles to cope with the volume of Covid patients and police ramp up enforcement of the brutal restrictions.Ms Patel used this evening\u0027s TV conference, during which she was flanked by the chair of the National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council, Martin Hewitt, and NHS London\u0027s medical director, Dr Vin Diwakar, to plead with people to follow the rules.She and Mr Hewitt said most people had been abiding by lockdown rules but they were still facing \u0027egregious\u0027 violations by some, and that police patrols would be stepped up and officers would become stricter about fines as they try to keep order on Britain\u0027s streets.Mr Hewitt also said that people refusing to wear masks on public transport should \u0027expect a fine\u0027, as he warned officers would no longer \u0027waste time\u0027 trying to reason with people. He revealed that forces across the UK have so far issued almost 45,000 fixed penalty notices to people breaking lockdown rules."},{"url":null,"title":"Vice President Mike Pence says NOT invoke 25th Amendment","story":"Share this articleMitch McConnell Said to be Pleased About Trump Impeachment Efforts - The New York TimesRep.

Now, they have both been honoured for their contributionsAmong the household names featured on the new year honours list, you’ll find hundreds of key workers and community champions who stepped up during the pandemic and made a huge inidual impact.Here, we meet two of them: a child and adolescent psychiatrist and a pub general manager who, thanks to their innovative thinking, enriched the lives of those in their community – and beyond.“During the pandemic, people Zoomed, Skyped and connected with families digitally, so why can’t we connect healthcare the same way,” asks consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist Prof Alka Surajprakash Ahuja, from Cardiff, who was awarded an MBE for her services to the NHS during Covid-19. Ahuja received the honour for her pivotal role in setting up the pioneering NHS Wales Video Consulting Service, which digitally connects patients with clinicians.The programme’s success means the focus was extended to care homes, too. “That was a place where we had the most vulnerable people who needed help, but professionals were very limited in terms of access. It allowed GPs to do virtual rounds, continuing to provide the support and care they needed.” Dentistry, optometry and pharmacy followed, with video appointments revolutionising the way a growing number of patients accessed healthcare. Ahuja’s research into video appointments also led her to investigate their value for schools. “We know schools are not going to be the same for a long, long time. But children and young people still need support for their mental and physical health, so that will hopefully enable remote delivery of care into school settings,” she says.The technology has proved life-changing. “One of our first patients was an elderly gentleman living on his own. He had an appointment with the oncologist – it was a newly diagnosed tumour that was probably cancerous. He was very anxious, which was understandable. What helped was his daughter in London and his son in Singapore could join the appointment virtually, which under normal circumstances wouldn’t be possible. It meant having family for the appointment was much more reassuring and helped contain his anxiety. When we spoke to him, he was in tears. He said: ‘My god, I just couldn’t believe it – it was like my daughter and son sitting next to me in the appointment.’”Despite the punishing workload, witnessing the results has made it worthwhile. “I think one thing that kept us going was that we all believed this was going to make a difference,” she says. “I still remember the day I left my clinical job – it was hard because I thought I’m not going to see my patients and it’s going to be next to impossible. My colleague said: ‘Don’t worry, you’re making history’ and I laughed. Now, I think what we have done has been amazing. Post-Covid, healthcare is not going to be the same – it’s going to change the landscape.”As general manager of the Portsmouth Arms in Basingstoke, Richard Curtis was awarded a BEM for services to charity and the community in Hampshire during the pandemic. At the time of the announcement, he had raised £52,500 for charity through the virtual pub quizzes he has hosted on Facebook since the outbreak of the pandemic. With a modest goal of £150, his first quiz – which began the day after pubs closed last March – quickly gained traction, turning into a nightly occurrence. “I never expected it to be anything other than my regulars who come to the pub, and to maybe attract a bit of a local audience,” he says. “We didn’t expect it to go worldwide.”Curtis, who estimates he’s now held around 300 online quizzes since March and is still going strong, has seen his efforts bring together people from around the globe in a bid to help alleviate loneliness and isolation. With the first quiz drawing around 120 participants, at its peak up to 1,500 people were joining online.“From March, it very quickly went from one quiz a week to 18,” he says. “We were doing a children’s one Monday to Friday, which I hosted with my children. I was then doing an adult one every night, and then on Saturday and Sunday I did a themed quiz at three o’clock, another at five, then an adults’ one at eight.”With each quiz filmed inside the pub (Curtis lives upstairs with his wife and three children) it offered “the feel of the pub” for those missing it. “I made a rule that if people couldn’t come to the pub, I wouldn’t be drinking, but that soon turned into people saying: ‘If we donate £200, will you have a beer?’”The biggest quiz – a world record attempt held across VE Day weekend that lasted an astonishing 35 hours – raised more than £21,000 for charity (the world record status is still pending). “The money we raised was beyond anybody’s belief. That weekend there was so much hope for what people could have done, and what they were actually allowed to do,” he says of the weekend, falling during the first national lockdown.The world record attempt was surprisingly gruelling, he says. “I just imagined I’d have to write loads of questions and stay awake. But sitting in that position for so long, my back was shot to pieces. And while staying awake for so long isn’t a problem, constantly talking for that amount of time is. Because I’d been talking for so long, my throat and tongue had swollen up so much that I couldn’t eat. I tried to eat a bacon sandwich at one point and choked, I just couldn’t swallow it.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Time to turn to the experts for some tips ... From pay freezes to furloughing and reduced working hours, 2020 changed the financial circumstances of many people, so it’s not a shock to find that more than a third of British people are worried about their finances as a result of the Covid-19 crisis, according to Aviva.The pandemic has shown that the future is impossible to predict, but surely that’s all the more reason to prepare for the unexpected when it comes to your money.Resist kneejerk reactionsSelling your car or leaping into a less-than-ideal job can seem like sensible moves when your financial circumstances change suddenly, but it’s not the time for kneejerk decisions. “Never rush into rash decisions because of loss of income,” says Laura Stewart-Smith, Aviva workplace savings manager, “Instead, take time to think things over before taking any action in relation to your finances.”Impulsive reactions aside, moving quickly to take stock and regain control of your finances is something Stewart-Smith recommends for anyone faced with loss of income. “Don’t delay in facing the facts – doing so sooner rather than later is likely to be better for your wellbeing, and can actually help you feel better compared with the uncertainty of not knowing your true financial position,” she says.Build a budgetIf your income drops, your first task should be to draw up a revised household budget. Cheryl Sharp, founder of the accountancy firm Pink Pig Financials, recommends analysing bank statements from the past three months to track where your money goes and identify savings you can quickly make.“Categorise everything into how important the spend is – for example, your mortgagerent is critical but a take-away coffee is a luxurynice to have,” she says.With your budget in place, you can formulate a plan to live within your means and avoid or get out of debt. But don’t start a budget and then forget about it. “Share it with someone you trust for accountability, and then track, review and adjust your budget as your circumstances change,” says Sharp.Don’t forget to include annual costs. Plan to put money aside each month towards those once-a-year bills, so they don’t come as a surprise.Pick up the phone“Talk to your bank and any other financial providers you have relationships with because they may be able to help,” says Stewart-Smith. “Ask what’s available in your circumstances, and whether you can review your package or defer payments. You might have payment protection that can kick in if you lose your job or experience loss of income, but you won’t necessarily know unless you pick up the phone and speak to those experts.”Don’t ditch insurance“Check whether you’ve got insurance policies designed to help if the worst happens, such as payment protection insurance, mortgage payment protection insurance or short-term income protection insurance,” says Jay Lee, a mortgage adviser and founder of uAcademy, which provides training for mortgage advisers. “They might be part of a bank-account package or a mortgage add-on product, so you may not even realise you have them.”It can be tempting to cut costs by ditching insurance policies when your income changes. “Don’t – your home is your castle and you should protect it, so buildings and contents insurance is a must,” says Lee.Reviewing your home insurance policy, however, does make sense when your finances change. “If you’re worried about unexpected expenses during a period of reduced income, you could invest in add-on packages such as boiler repair or accidental damage and home emergencies policies, which will cover these eventualities.”Ponder your pensionIf you make fixed monthly payments into a pension, it may be worth switching to a flexible plan if making the payments is too much of a financial stretch. “It’s also worth reviewing your pension, as you may be paying higher annual charges than you would in a different scheme,” says Lee.While paying lower charges today won’t immediately put money in your pocket, you could end up with a bigger pension pot in the future, making you better off when you retire.Start a rainy day fundHaving an existing savings pot can help soften the blow when the unexpected impacts your income. Even if you haven’t got that to fall back on, don’t make the mistake of thinking saving is only for when finances are flush. The best time to start saving is now.“Some people believe they don’t have any spare cash to put away for emergency savings, but this is rarely the case,” says Claire Roach, founder of Money Saving Central.“Even when your income is reduced, put as much as possible into an emergency fund each month – aim to save three to six months of basic living expenses so you can take control of your finances during times of illness or unexpected loss of income, and continue to meet your financial obligations.”Consider new income opportunities A loss of income can hit hard, but it can sometimes yield new opportunities. Lee lost his job in fraud investigation for a UK bank during the first lockdown, but it prompted him to launch his business running online training courses for mortgage advisers, which now turns over £5,000 a month.“It was an extremely worrying time as not only had I lost my job, but lockdown meant I couldn’t find any other work to keep me going until the situation improved,” he says.“I set up my business hoping it would cover a few of my bills, but within weeks I was making enough money to keep running my household.”Above all, remember that support is available when your financial circumstances change. “Take all the practical steps to shore up your finances and make sure your money is working as hard as it possibly can for you. Also, check whether you can apply for any benefits, speak to your tax office to see if you’re eligible for rebates, and look into tax-efficient investments and savings vehicles,” says Stewart-Smith.“Then remind yourself that the situation is not your fault. Loss of income is very often outside of an inidual’s control. But there are many organisations that can help. You’re not alone.”The views expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

None of the bottles will be opened until the end of February. That’s when Space Cargo Unlimited, the company behind the experiments, will pop open a bottle or two for a tasting in Bordeaux by some of France’s top connoisseurs. Months of chemical testing will follow. Researchers are eager to see how space altered the sedimentation and bubbles.Agricultural science was the primary objective, said Nicolas Gaume, the company’s CEO and co-founder, although he admits it will be fun to sample the wine. “Our goal is to tackle the solution of how we’re going to have an agriculture tomorrow that is both organic and healthy and able to feed humanity, and we think space has the key,” Gaume said from Bordeaux.With climate change, Gaume said agricultural products such as grapes will need to adapt to harsher conditions.

Then came Albert Einstein, Pope John Paul II and a string of global luminaries who the entrepreneur-turned-artist admired.“It might look simple, but to achieve this richness of detail was hard work,” a local television reporter gushed during a 2015 visit to Armacollo’s waxwork collection in southern Brazil. “The artist wanted to capture the character as well as the soul of each person.”Whether the septuagenarian sculptor achieved that goal is now a matter of intense international debate, after images of his wax creations went viral on social media – six years after first being displayed in the town of Rolândia.Footage of Armacollo’s startling figures spread like wildfire last week after internet users unearthed – and ridiculed – the video report about their exhibition in a local church.The strangely disfigured personalities on show include Nelson Mandela, who has a beefcake’s body, a tiny head and dazzling peroxide hair Princess Diana, who wears a crazed and terrifying grin and Marilyn Monroe, who boasts a neck the size of a tree trunk and a seemingly melted face. Nearby, black hairs sprout from unusual corners of Elvis Presley’s shiny wax face.“Brazilian horror story,” gasped one of the numerous Twitter users discombobulated by the models.Word of the collection – which reminded some of Spain’s jaw-dropping botched restorations – soon spread. Journalists from leading news outlets in Brazil and beyond pursued the previously unknown artist for a reaction to his newfound fame.“If it was about making money it might bother me whether people appreciated what I was doing or not. But I do the things I do because I enjoy them. I did this for our town. If people like it, come and visit. If they don’t, don’t,” he shrugged. “Why worry?”Armacollo’s statues, which each involve about 5kg of wax and imported English eyeballs, have moved since their 2015 television debut and are now housed in a nearby museum named after his father. There, Princess Diana has been joined by newer sculptures, including a similarly peculiar portrayal of the Queen.Until recently the exhibition also featured a statue of the corruption-busting judge Sergio Moro with a distinct resemblance to England defender Harry Maguire. But Armacollo evicted Brazil’s former security minister after he resigned from government and took a high-paid job with a consultancy involved in the judicial recovery of one of the construction giants he once pursued. “It’s all a bit weird, isn’t it?” Armacollo said.Like many in south Brazil, Armacollo is a supporter of president Jair Bolsonaro, and had considered honouring the right-wing populist with his wax. “But then I thought: ‘I’m going to hold off for a bit to keep an eye on his behaviour.’ For now I’m still behind him and think he’s on the right path – but let’s wait a bit more to see to see if that solidifies.”The artist scoffed at the idea of celebrating Bolsonaro’s leftwing rival, the former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. “You’re not in favour of him, are you?” he asked this reporter with a mistrustful laugh.Politics aside, Armacollo hoped “all this commotion” would attract tourists from other cities and abroad. A similar museum in Norfolk achieved cult status as “the world’s worst waxworks”, drawing thousands of visitors with its un-lifelike lifelikes.Armacollo’s only regret was the reaction of his teenager granddaughter, left distraught by the mocking of her grandfather’s mannequins. “She’s very sensitive. She even cried,” the artist admitted, “but now she’s laughing about it too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d48434da71a91370c98d38213af62efb9633a9b7/0_320_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=bc02c2de16705ed66ccef6f3719d6b6f","title":"quiz how well do you understand englands latest lockdown rules","story":"With even the PM’s spokesperson seemingly stumped on what constitutes ‘local’ exercise, test your knowledge of the restrictionsWith questions raised over whether Boris Johnson exercising seven miles from his home in London was within the rules of England’s latest national lockdown, we thought you might like to test how well you know the current restrictions.So take our quiz and find out.

A year into the pandemic,  health editor Sarah Boseley looks at what questions still need to be answered A World Health Organization team of international experts tasked with investigating the origins Covid-19 will arrive in China this week. Scientists want to determine how the virus jumped species into humans. A year into the pandemic there are still many unanswered questions over the origins of the novel virus.  ’s health editor, Sarah Boseley, tells Rachel Humpheys about what the WHO has uncovered over the past 12 months and the challenges it has faced. Ideally, door-to-door detective work, talking to the first people to fall ill and their families and colleagues, would have begun in Wuhan in January. But the city was in lockdown, its streets deserted. And the rest of the world had not yet understood what it was facing, Bruce Aylward, the Canadian doctor and epidemiologist appointed by WHO to lead its fact-finding mission to China in early February told Sarah in a recent phone call.  Now, Sarah says, the team tasked with the latest investigation has an even greater task on its hands as the lapse in time will make it harder to track down certain clues that might help answer where the pandemic started. It’s crucial we find these answers however, not only to deal with this pandemic, but to stop something like this happening again.

However, he told Sky News that it was “impossible to know” when restrictions could be eased.“We will keep the restrictions in place not a moment longer than they are necessary, but we will keep them in place as long as they are necessary,” he said.“These measures that we have got in place that we hope to be able to lift, and we should be able to lift when we have been able to protect through vaccination those who are vulnerable - right now the vaccination is not in a position to do that.”Asked about the row over food parcels given to parents during lockdown, which focussed on the schools catering company Chartwell after pictures emerged of the apparently meagre contents of the firm’s parcels, he said: “the company has apologised and rightly so.”Japan is set to expand a coronavirus state of emergency on Wednesday to seven more regions including the major cities of Osaka and Kyoto, as infections surge nationwide.AFP reported that the country’s outbreak remains comparatively small, with around 4,100 deaths overall, there has been a sharp spike in cases this winter and medics say hospitals are under heavy strain in the worst-affected areas.The month-long emergency measure - which unlike strict lockdowns elsewhere in the world carries no enforcement mechanism - was implemented in the greater Tokyo area last week.It asks restaurants and bars to close by 8 pm, with residents requested to avoid unnecessary outings and telework strongly encouraged.“We want to have a declining trend in infections by February 7, by all means,” said Yasutoshi Nishimura, the minister in charge of Japan’s pandemic response, referring to the period’s planned end date.The move, expected to be announced by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga this evening, means that, from Thursday, 11 of the country’s 47 prefectures will be under the state of emergency - accounting for about 60 percent of its GDP.Good morning. This is Archie Bland picking up the global coronavirus liveblog from Helen Sullivan, and beginning in the Chinese province of Heilongjiang, where the government has declared an ““emergency state”, telling residents not to leave the province unless absolutely necessary, and to cancel conferences and gatherings.That was in response to the province of 37.5m people finding 28 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, including 12 that were asymptomatic.Three infections were found in the provincial capital Harbin, which is hosting a famous ice sculpture festival that is usually a big draw for tourists.Suihua city, a short car journey north and home to more than 5.2 million people, was sealed off on Monday after reporting one confirmed case and 45 asymptomatic cases.China has recorded the biggest daily jump in Covid cases in more than five months (see earlier post), despite three cities in lockdown, increased testing and other measures aimed at preventing another wave of infections in the world’s second biggest economy.Here’s our latest story from China:That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. Before the pandemic news resumes, here is a video of hummingbirds having a pool party to bring your blood pressure down: Here are the key developments from the last few hours: The president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, Yoshiro Mori, has said preparations for the summer Olympics will continue, despite growing doubts that the Games can be held while the coronavirus pandemic continues to rage.Mori, a former Japanese prime minister, said postponing the Games a second time would be “absolutely impossible”.“Spring will always come, morning will surely come even after long nights,” he said during an online event on Tuesday organised by the Kyodo news agency. “Believing in that, to give joy and hope to many people, we will do our best until the end.”The Japanese government and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided in March last year to postpone Tokyo 2020 by a year due to the pandemic, and agreed that a second delay was out of the question. The only remaining options are to go head this summer or cancel the games altogether: More now on the resignation of Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser for Operation Warp Speed. Slaoui will be available to the incoming Joe Biden administration as a consultant for about four weeks, a Biden transition official told Reuters late on Tuesday. Slaoui’s role leading the Covid-19 vaccine development for the government effort is expected to be diminished after 20 January, according to CNBC, which first reported the development.The Biden team has not asked Slaoui to stay past his current contract, which includes a 30 days’ notice before termination, CNBC said.The US Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Operation Warp Speed, did not immediately respond to requests for comment late Tuesday.Operation Warp Speed is the US government’s program to distribute Covid-19 vaccines.The operation started last year as a national effort by the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense, aiming to provide substantial quantities of safe and effective vaccines for Americans by January 2021.However, only about 2.6 million Americans had received a Covid-19 vaccine going into the last day of December, putting the United States far short of the government’s target to vaccinate 20 million people last month. “We know that it should be better and we are working hard to make it better,” Slaoui said at a media briefing late in December. According to Politico, Slaoui had said he planned to step down by early this year, but last week he said he “decided to extend that in order to ensure that the operation continues to perform the way it has performed through the transition of administration.” California lifted a stay-at-home order in the 13-county Sacramento region on Tuesday as hospital conditions improved, a rare turn of good news as the state pushes through what Governor Gavin Newsom called “its most intense surge” of the coronavirus.The order imposed 10 December banned gatherings outside a household and shuttered or restricted many businesses. With virus cases and hospitalisations more stable now, the region can resume outdoor dining and worship services, reopen hair and nail salons and other businesses, and increase capacity at retailers Gatherings of up to three households are allowed.Newsom made the announcement in a social media post that remined people to wear masks, stay home as much as possible and offered the hopeful promise: “There is a light at the end of this tunnel.”Three of the state’s five regions — the San Francisco Bay Area, Central Valley and Southern California — remain under the stay-at-home order because their intensive care capacity at hospitals is severely limited.California has seen an enormous surge of cases, hospitalizations and deaths since Thanksgiving. The state is averaging 42,000 new virus cases a day and recorded 3,500 virus deaths in the last week. On Monday the death toll topped 30,000 since the pandemic began.Health officials are warning that hospitalizations and deaths are likely to continue to increase as people who contracted the virus during the holidays get sicker.Our full story on the latest from China now: More now on the African Union securing 300m vaccine doses, via Reuters: He gave no further details but said “we will make further announcements as we conclude our negotiations with vaccine manufacturers.”Africa has scrambled on multiple fronts to obtain vaccine supplies. Ramaphosa said the African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team recently created under the AU “has done tremendous work to secure vaccine doses” through what he called intensive engagement with manufacturers.“The South African government has also been engaging directly with several vaccine manufacturers for over six months,” he said.“Given the massive global demand for vaccines and the vastly greater purchasing power of wealthier countries, we are exploring all avenues to get as many vaccine doses as soon as possible,” Ramaphosa said.The African Union has secured close to 300 million COovid-19 vaccine doses in the largest such agreement yet for Africa, a continental official said Tuesday.AP: Nicaise Ndembi, senior science adviser for the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press in an interview that the current AU chair, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, is expected to announce the news on Wednesday.The 300 million doses are being secured independently of the global Covax effort aimed at distributing Covid-19 vaccines to lower-income countries, Ndembi said.“We have reached the final stage of our deals,” he said, referring questions about who will be providing the vaccines and at what cost to the upcoming announcement.The news comes as coronavirus infections spike again in parts of Africa, especially South Africa, where a rapidly spreading variant of the coronavirus now makes up most of the new cases. The continent over the weekend surpassed 3 million confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, with more than 1.2 million in South Africa.“We plan to have these by the end of the first quarter” of 2021, Ndembi said of the nearly 300 million doses, which will be allocated on the continental platform the AU set up last year to make it easier for Africa’s 54 countries to pool their purchasing power and buy pandemic supplies in bulk.“We’re expecting 600 million doses from the Covax facility,” he said, but African officials are still waiting on the details, so “we’re happy we have alternative solutions.”The president of the Federated States of Micronesia has said the country’s first case of Covid-19 - detected in a sailor on board a ship held in an island lagoon - does not pose a threat to the wider community.David Panuelo’s government announced last week that a lone sailor on board the government ship, MV Chief Mailo, had tested positive to the coronavirus after returning from the Philippines.In a nationally televised address broadcast this week, Panuelo said the crew was permitted to return to the country after being tested for the virus, and because they feared piracy“The crew was rightly fearful of increasing numbers of pirates in the region which contributed to their fears. So I could either abandon the ship that the government uses to service the state of Chuuk and leave its crew and the 12 year-old boy from Poluwat outside of our care or I could bring them home.”Panuelo said the single case had been successfully quarantined, with the ship held in Pohnpei lagoon under guard.“Citizens across the nation should remain calm… do not panic because the situation is contained.“The inidual with Covid-19 on the Chief Mailo does not present any immediate risk of the virus spreading to the broader community in Pohnpei,” he said.The Federated States of Micronesia have recorded zero cases of Covid-19 before this case. Schools, churches and business remain open and there is no mandated requirement to wear masks in the archipelago, though it is encouraged, along with social distancing.Already, FSM has received 9000 doses of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine from the United States, with which it has a compact of free association. An inoculation program for the 100,000-strong population has already begun.Pacific island nations have been among the most successful in the world at keeping out the virus after closing their borders early in response to the threat, despite the huge cost to tourism-dependent economies.Several island nations which were virus-free have lost that status recently with Solomon Islands, the Marshall Islands, Samoa and Vanuatu falling to the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the world.However, several other island countries including Tonga, Palau, Nauru and Kiribati are believed to remain virus-free.Former Bolivian President Evo Morales tested positive for the coronavirus and is getting treatment to combat symptoms, according to a statement issued by his office late on Tuesday.“He is currently stable and is receiving medical attention,” the statement said, without providing details on his symptoms.Last week, 61-year old Morales participated in group meetings with coca growers in Cochabamba in the central part of the country.The critical-care wards of major hospitals in Bolivia and neighboring Peru have been near collapse after end-of-year holidays, reflecting regional health concerns as much of Latin America struggles to secure adequate Covid-19 vaccine supplies.While daily cases remain below last year’s peak, depleted resources, weary medical workers and a recent rush of severe cases are taxing already ailing healthcare systems from Chile to Mexico, officials say.Bolivia has had 176,761 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 9,454 deaths.Indonesian president Joko Widodo became the first person in the country to receive a shot of a Chinese-made Covid-19 vaccine on Wednesday morning, as health officials began an immunisation campaign in one of the world’s most populous countries.Indonesia, which is struggling to contain one of the worst outbreaks in South-East Asia, has approved the Sinovac vaccine for emergency use.The vaccine will be rolled out over the coming months, with priority given to health care workers, civil servants and other vulnerable groups. It will be free to all Indonesian citizens.“We know that the cold-chain distribution is not complete. This is the obstacle,” Budi Gunadi Sadikin, Indonesia’s health minister said on Tuesday.Mexican health authorities will make a decision this week on whether to authorize Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine after getting access to data on it, Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said on Tuesday.Reuters: Lopez-Gatell said President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had instructed authorities to “proceed speedily” with the process.“The file has been under review since the weekend by (health regulator) COFEPRIS and very soon there will be a decision regarding the authorization for emergency use, as occurred with the other two vaccines,” he said at a regular government news conference.He later said Cofepris was expected to make a decision this week on authorization for emergency use in Mexico.Lopez-Gatell, Mexico’s coronavirus czar, said on Monday evening that Mexico was considering acquiring 24 million doses of Sputnik V.Mexico has already authorized the vaccines developed by Pfizer Inc with BioNTech SE and AstraZeneca Plc.Lopez-Gatell said he met with Russian officials to discuss the vaccine during a trip last week to Argentina, whose government has started rolling out Sputnik V to health workers."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4456652.1610478205!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a ghastly future leading scientists offer bleak prediction for civilisation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOut of control fire on Narrow Neck Plateau, Katoomba, Blue Mountains, Australia. Climate change is causing extreme weather, prolonged droughts and increasing bushfires Getty ImagesWorld leaders “need a cold shower regarding the state of our environment, both to plan and act to avoid a ghastly future”, according to 17 leading scientists who have assessed the current state of civilisation.They warn the outlook for planet Earth “is more dire and dangerous than is generally understood”.A loss of bioersity and accelerating climate change in coming decades coupled with ignorance and inaction “is threatening the survival of all species, including our very own”, say the experts who include eminent biologists at Stanford University and UCLA in the United States, and Flinders University in Australia.Lead author Prof Corey Bradshaw of Flinders University said the group had summarised the state of the natural world in stark form to help clarify the gravity of the human predicament.“Humanity is causing a rapid loss of bioersity and, with it, Earth’s ability to support complex life. But the mainstream is having difficulty grasping the magnitude of this loss, despite the steady erosion of the fabric of human civilisation,” Prof Bradshaw said.“In fact, the scale of the threats to the biosphere and all its lifeforms is so great that it is difficult to grasp for even well-informed experts,” he said.“The problem is compounded by ignorance and short-term self-interest, with the pursuit of wealth and political interests stymying the action that is crucial for survival,” he added.The expert in mass extinction, Prof Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University, said no political or economic system, or leadership, was prepared to handle the predicted disasters, or even capable of such action.“Stopping bioersity loss is nowhere close to the top of any country’s priorities, trailing far behind other concerns such as employment, healthcare, economic growth, or currency stability,” he said.While it was positive news that US president-elect Biden intends to re-engage the US in the Paris climate accord within his first 100 days of office, “it is a minuscule gesture given the scale of the challenge”.“Humanity is running an ecological ponzi scheme in which society robs nature and future generations to pay for short-term economic enhancement today,” he believed.Most economies operate on the basis that counteraction now is too costly to be politically palatable, Prof Ehrlich said. “Combined with disinformation campaigns to protect short-term profits it is doubtful that the scale of changes we need will be made in time.”Speak boldly and fearlesslyProf Dan Blumstein from UCLA said the scientists were choosing to speak boldly and fearlessly because life literally depends on it.“What we are saying might not be popular, and indeed is frightening. But we need to be candid, accurate, and honest if humanity is to understand the enormity of the challenges we face in creating a sustainable future,” he said.“Without political will backed by tangible action that scales to the enormity of the problems facing us, the added stresses to human health, wealth, and well-being will perversely diminish our political capacity to mitigate the erosion of the Earth’s life-support system upon which we all depend.“Human population growth and consumption continues to escalate, and we’re still more focused on expanding human enterprise than we are on devising and implementing solutions to critical issues such as bioersity loss. By the time we fully comprehend the impact of ecological deterioration, it will be too late.”Without fully appreciating and broadcasting the scale of the problems and the enormity of the solutions required, society will fail to achieve even modest sustainability goals, “and catastrophe will surely follow”, he predicted.The experts say in their “perspective” paper, which cites more than 150 studies, that they seek to outline clearly and unambiguously likely future trends in bioersity decline, mass extinction, climate disruption, and planetary “toxification” – all tied to human consumption and population growth. It is also “to demonstrate the near certainty these problems will worsen over coming decades, with negative impacts for centuries to come”.“It also explains the impact of political impotence and the ineffectiveness of current and planned actions to address the ominous scale of environmental erosion,” they conclude.The added stresses to human health, wealth and wellbeing will perversely diminish political capacity to mitigate the erosion of ecosystem services on which society depends, they find. “The science underlying these issues is strong, but awareness is weak.”The paper – Underestimating the challenges of avoiding a ghastly future – is published in the latest issue of Frontiers in Conservation Science."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Bioersity loss and climate change coupled with inaction \u0026lsquothreatens survival of all species\u0026rsquoCommitment to protect land and marine ecosystems made at One Planet Summit hosted by French president MacronThe Covid and climate crises are driving demand for eco-conscious homewares"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4456716.1610484458!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"administrators getting covid vaccine before gps says doctor","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPreparing a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.

The same online portal will eventually be used to register vaccinations among members of the public.While more than 10 per cent of GPs have been vaccinated, this has arisen through their links to hospitals or by invitation to hospital vaccination sessions.Medical Council president and GP Rita Doyle said her colleagues and their staff were desperate to get vaccinated and were promised access to a booking portal on Monday but this had not materialised.Doctors’ warningsSome doctors suggested on social media their surgeries might have to close due to the non-availability of vaccines. “If GPs are not vaccinated soon, practices will have to further restrict services, some will inevitably close and out-of-hours will be suspended,” rural GP Patrick O’Dwyer commented.“When administrators without patient contact are getting vaccines before GPs who are seeing hundreds of patients each month, somebody has made a really stupid decision,” said Galway doctor Brian O’Higgins.GPs and pharmacists are expected to be heavily involved in the rollout of vaccines if the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine, which does not have special cold storage requirements, is approved by the European Medicines Agency at the end of the month. However, they would have to be vaccinated first before immunising others.Asked about reports of non-frontline staff getting the vaccine ahead of time, the HSE said it had no specific accounts of deviation from a reasonable approach to prioritisation but if any specific incidents of inappropriate prioritisation for the vaccine were identified, “this will be addressed”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4456599.1610474145!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 change in ireland s fortunes massive and unparalleled","story":"A record surge in Covid-19 cases in Ireland was due to increased social mixing over Christmas and was not caused by a new variant from Britain, Dr Mike Ryan of the World Health Organisation has said.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan and National Immunisation Advisory Committee chair Prof Karina Butler. ‘It’s a perfect storm – all these humans coming close together in heated indoor spaces, and then the new variant thrown into the mix,’ says Prof ButlerThe speed of Ireland’s fall from grace in terms of Covid-19 statistics is astonishing and perplexing. From having the lowest incidence in Europe at the end of November, we now appear to rank worst in the world by international measures of the disease.Even by the more formal official figures produced by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan at the National Public Health Emergency Team briefing this week, it is clear the change in Ireland’s fortunes has been massive and unparalleled among our neighbours.By last Sunday, the 14-day incidence had reached 1,245 cases per 100,000 people, with only the Czech Republic recording a higher figure. Within the space of a fortnight, the incidence here grew more than six-fold. No other country came near Portugal saw its 14-day incidence increase by 94 per cent, and the UK recorded a 78 per cent rise, compared to our’s rising by 518 per cent. While cases in Ireland hit record levels, the numbers declined in about half of all European countries.The figures are all the more alarming for having come on the back of lengthy restrictions stretching back to September. Restrictions were eased during December following a six-week lockdown, but they were not completely lifted. Though much of the rest of Europe has had to be reacquainted with lockdown in recent weeks, Ireland has had more stringent restrictions, for longer, than most other places in Europe. The policing of public health measures here, though, has been lighter touch than elsewhere. So what happened in December to set us up for our current fate? By the time restrictions had eased at the start of the month, daily cases had fallen to about 400, far higher than had been hoped for. That meant there was still plenty of disease in the community, too much for the contact tracing system to keep up with. Problem areasPeople were still picking up the disease in problem areas such as hospitals. The Border continued to act as a sieve, channelling new infections from the high-incidence North to the (then) low-incidence Republic.Dr Holohan’s data, culled from opinion polls and mobility data, paint a picture of a people who, at that point, started worrying less and moving about more. As Christmas approached, retail, recreational activity and traffic rose to levels not seen since before the pandemic. Some people acted “as if nothing had happened,” he observed.This pattern of activity served to seed more and more cases, and events over Christmas then “sealed the deal”. Those who had socialised before the holiday season got together with their families for Christmas Day, ensuring the virus was spread across generations. Some of these new infections then transmitted further among those who partied around the start of the new year.This activity, occurring often in ill-ventilated, dry, indoor locations because it was winter, explains why we now have a third wave, but it does not fully account for the magnitude of that wave. Other countries had Christmas, winter weather, and restrictions going up and down, but they’re not in the same pickle.New variantThis is why the new variant, first identified in Kent in England, is coming under more scrutiny. It now accounts for almost half of all samples genetically sequenced in Irish labs, and is on the way to becoming the dominant strain here.It is surely no coincidence that, apart from Czech Republic, the other European country battling a steep rise in cases over the past six weeks is the UK. Some 50,000 people flew into Dublin Airport over the Christmas and new year period, including 1,500 from the UK after the Government banned flights from Britain on December 21st to prevent the spread of the variant. This traffic can only have accelerated the rise of the variant and the general spread of the disease.“It’s a perfect storm – all these humans coming close together in heated indoor spaces, and then the new variant thrown into the mix,” says Prof Karina Butler, chair of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee. In the run-up to Christmas, Butler booked a meal out with her husband. On arrival in the pub, she found the dining area crowded and ill-ventilated. “It wasn’t a good environment, so we left.” How many others stayed?ICU numbersThe number of patients hospitalised is now twice as high as in the spring, while ICU numbers have just surpassed the peak of the first surge.Deaths lag even further behind cases, but there is as yet no sign of excess deaths this winter, according to European figures. Ireland’s 14-day mortality rate remains the second lowest in Europe, after Finland. This will change too, especially if hospitals are overwhelmed, but we may well escape the worst that some other countries experienced.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4456736.1610485148!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"catherine corless there doesn t seem to be a lot in mother and baby report","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTuam mother and baby home survivor Carmel Larkin and historian Catherine Corless. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyDown a puddle-filled alleyway, tucked behind a children’s playground in Tuam, a small enclosed patch of grass covers the remains of infants who died in St Mary’s mother and baby home, lying in unmarked graves.Knitted children’s booties hang from the shrubbery that skirts the enclosure on the site of the former home, while a list of 796 names of infants and children is now tacked to a wall.Images of the patch of grass filled TV screens around the world on Tuesday following the publication of a long-awaited report that examined the “appalling” conditions that existed in Tuam, and elsewhere.Local historian Catherine Corless, who a decade ago published her findings in the Journal of the Old Tuam Society, said she felt “completely deflated” by the 3,000-page report.“So far there doesn’t seem to be a lot in it … with a whole team of them, and what is at the end of it?” she asks, adding that she has not yet had the chance to read the report in full.Though “exhausted”, Corless says the fight for the rights of survivors to get “care and recognition” continues: “I am speaking on behalf of the survivors we need an apology.”Saying she hopes for clear apologies, too, from the Bon Secours and the Archdiocese of Tuam, Corless says: “What upset me is Micheál Martin blaming us – society.”‘Is that it?’From her living room in Tuam, Carmel Larkin watches Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman present the key findings of the report to survivors of the homes: “Is that it?” she asks as the video on her iPad comes to an end.She was kept in St Mary’s for five years and had hoped the Government would accept fully that the Catholic Church and State were to blame. “This seems to be all talk and no action.“I don’t think an apology means anything … They are talking about redress but I think half of us will be dead before we get any redress,” she says.Larkin wants to track down information about her mother, though she believes she is now dead. She knows her name, but nothing more. Did she enjoy crocheting and knitting like her daughter does, she wonders.“I don’t even have a picture … I never got a cuddle from my mother,” she says, “I don’t even know if I have any brothers or sisters. I have no identity because I don’t know who I am.”Survivor PJ Haverty (69) is underwhelmed, too. The speech by Taoiseach Micheál Martin and the snippets he had gleaned so far from the report were a “kick in the teeth”, he says.“I am afraid to say too much, because I haven’t read the full report, but I really hope there is more to come. If there is more, then maybe people will say to me: ‘PJ, I am sorry about what happened to your mother.’ ”The ‘lucky ones’Sprinkled throughout his dialogue he repeats that he is “one of the lucky ones” who escaped further institutions and was fostered by a loving family. He feels lucky, too, because he tracked down his mother.“An apology might be all right for me, but then again I found my mother. What about the others? There are people who are still looking for their brothers and sisters,” he says.“To think of the suffering those women went through is beyond belief. I want this put into the history books to show what was done. The kids of the future need to look back and see what was done.”The next step in Tuam must be the exhumation of the infants from the mass grave, and a proper burial for them. “This should have been done long ago,” says Corless.However, such efforts will create new problems, says David Burke, editor of the Tuam Herald: “I think it is going to be very disturbing to some people living in the vicinity that some of their gardens would have to be dug up.”During his primary school days, Burke remembers that a row of desks were kept for the so-called “illegitimate” children, with others sent to join them as punishment for bad behaviour.“It is shocking when you think about it, but as a child you just accept it,” he says.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Donald Trump impeachment: Key Republicans support removing President from office - latest newsCovid-19 vaccine: Latest updates on Oxford, Moderna and Pfizer breakthroughs - and who will get it first?Coronavirus latest news: London leaders call for tougher Covid restrictionsWhat is the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution and can it be invoked to remove Donald Trump from office?US Capitol riots: Everything we know about what happened when Trump\u0026#39s supporters stormed Washington Inauguration Day 2021: When is Joe Biden sworn in as US president, and what time is the virtual parade?Comment: Taiwan must not become the next Hong KongTracking UK Covid vaccinations: Are we on target to end lockdown?Oxford Covid-19 vaccine Q\u0026ampA: How effective is it, and how is it different to the Pfizer vaccine?The priority list for the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines - and how they will be rolled outSchool closures in Covid lockdown: latest news on when they could reopenEngland\u0026#39s new lockdown rules - and the stricter measures being consideredSpeeding British drivers to evade fines in Europe after BrexitBritain should lobby US to keep troops in Afghanistan,  Lords’ sayComment: The Tories have betrayed Northern Ireland with their Brexit dealSir David Attenborough to become 5G hologram in project to show benefits of techSmacking young children just once linked to behaviour problems in teens, study findsStruggle to replace Angela Merkel as her party votes for a new leaderNigel Farage warns Democrats: If you \u0026#39martyr\u0026#39 Donald Trump what follows \u0026#39could be very sinister indeed\u0026#39The astonishing story of Orson Welles\u0026#39s \u0026#39Voodoo Macbeth\u0026#39Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"twitter proves dont actually like encountering people different","story":"There was a time when we thought if we could just all communicate with one another, across the world, person-to-person that the world would be immeasurably better – we’d lose our doubt and suspicion and gain a real understanding of our shared humanity and our shared value. Such was the idealism when communications technologies started to make this vision sound possible that it was enshrined in the mottos of the institutions of the new radio era: “Nation shall speak peace unto nation” remains the motto of the BBC to this day.Technology in the 21st century has delivered on the vision of a global conversation in a way that radio waves never could. We now have a platform that creates a common ground where everyone from world leaders, to the pope, to ambassadors, journalists and the man or woman in the street can share their ideas on virtually any topic.The problem is that platform is called Twitter – and few if any of us feel as if that particular social network is about to foster a new era of world peace.The reflexive reaction is to blame the technology companies themselves. There’s certainly a good case to make against them – they often seem almost painfully out of touch to the problems their networks cause, they moderate content too little and too late, and for years they provided a platform to Donald Trump to incite all sorts of actions against his political enemies saying they could take no action against a sitting President – until they could.On top of the many legitimate criticisms to be levelled against Twitter and other tech giants comes an idea that it is their algorithms and the way they display their posts that are polarising us: they are creating so-called “filter bubbles”, exposing us only to views that we agree with until our endless scrolling radicalises us into an extreme version of our offline selves.This is possible, though the theory is not backed up by any kind of strong evidence. But there’s a simpler alternative explanation which seems to better fit reality: Twitter and social media isn’t iding us because it pushes us further apart. It’s iding us because it brings us closer together.Before the internet, it was easy to imagine that whatever opinions we held were probably shared by most people – or at least would be if we could only have chance to persuade people of them. We rarely knew what our neighbours thought of the political issues of the day – we often wouldn’t know what our extended family actually thought about immigration, gay rights, abortion, or numerous other issues. On top of this, many of our usual rules of social etiquette meant we would rarely discuss those topics.Now, we can debate and share any issue with anyone in real time – and we’ve discovered lots of people disagree wildly with us and will not be persuaded by our most reasonable arguments. The result is we quickly get frustrated, then angry, then find we’ve lost 12 hours shouting at a stranger – or our problematic uncle – on the internet.We like to say that the internet is pushing us apart. Instead, it’s pulling us together – and that, in itself, might just be the problem. The internet has delivered on the dream it promised us: man can speak unto man. It’s out fault, not the technology’s, that this has turned out to be something of a nightmare.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"analysis southern africas covid cases rocket no vaccines roll","story":"Is this just a Christmas hangover of cases spreading due to more mixing over the holidays? We can’t know for sure. But a small sample of tests in Zambia in late December found that most were the new South African variant.There are two policy responses to this in the UK and Ireland – hard lockdown and a rapid vaccine rollout. Sadly neither are easy options in southern Africa.Lockdowns generally don’t work in low-income countries, as nations from Peru to India to South Africa discovered last year. For most people in low income countries, the choice is not between working from home or from the office – it’s whether you can work and feed your family, or not.Even if lockdowns don’t eradicate the virus, they can still be helpful in slowing the virus spread until vaccines are rolled out. On January 2, Zimbabwe banned inter-city travel and ordered non-essential businesses to close. On Monday, the South African government shut its land borders.The choice facing southern African governments is terrible. Do they send the economy back into deep recession, trying to enact a lockdown that they know won’t work, and build up debt levels that will be hard to afford? Or do they let the virus spread and accept a big rise in deaths?If there is one small mercy, it is that the proportion of the elderly in southern Africa is so much smaller than in Europe. While roughly 14 per cent of the UK population is over 70, the number of elderly for South Africa is three per cent, Zimbabwe two per cent and in Zambia just one per cent. It would take just a quarter of a million vaccinations to protect all over 70s in Zambia – Israel vaccinates this many people every 36 hours.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bitcoin owner has two guesses left unlock 220m cryptocurrency","story":"A Bitcoin owner has revealed he only has two guesses left to unlock more than $220m in cryptocurrency after eight failed attempts to access his fortune.Stefan Thomas, a German-born computer programmer based in San Francisco, was given 7,002 Bitcoins more than ten years ago as a reward for recording a video explaining how the cryptocurrency works.At the time, the Bitcoins were worth between $2 to $6 each.With the price of Bitcoin rising rapidly during the coronavirus pandemic, those Bitcoins are now worth around $34,000 each, putting the value of the total fortune at more than $220 million.Unfortunately for Mr Thomas, he kept the password to accessing the digital wallet holding the Bitcoin on a piece of paper - which he lost years ago.The password is needed to unlock a small hard drive, known as an IronKey, which contains the private keys to a digital wallet that holds Mr Thomas\u0027 Bitcoin fortune.The IronKey allows users 10 guesses before it encrypts its contents forever.Mr Thomas said he has already tried eight passwords he uses without success.“I would just lay in bed and think about it,” Mr Thomas told the New York Times. “Then I would go to the computer with some new strategy, and it wouldn’t work, and I would be desperate again.”Mr Thomas\u0027 unlucky tale has thrown light on one of the pitfalls that come with dealing in cryptocurrencies, which, unlike traditional banks, do not have a function to retrieve lost or forgotten passwords.According to the cryptocurrency data company Chainalysis, around 20 per cent of the existing 18.5 million Bitcoin appears to be stuck in lost or otherwise inaccessible digital wallets.Many locked out owners have been forced to watch on, unable to cash in on their digital wealth, as the value of Bitcoin rapidly increased during the pandemic.  Wallet Recovery Services, a business that helps find lost digital keys, said it has gotten 70 requests a day from people who want help recovering their riches, three times the number of a month ago.After the coverage of Mr Thomas’ plight, some experts have suggested the computer programmer invest his money into ways to hack his IronKey and unlock the funds.Alex Stamos, an internet security expert at Stanford Internet Observatory, said he believed he could crack the password within six months - in exchange for a 10 per cent cut of the digital fortune.But for now Mr Thomas says he has put his IronKey out of sight and out of mind.  “I got to a point where I said to myself, ‘Let it be in the past, just for your own mental health,’” he told the New York Times.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"could anything wearyingly predictable another lefty charge oxbridge","story":"Oxford has just released its offers to next year’s students with Cambridge due to follow shortly. For even the brightest boffins, boasting CVs stuffed with teacher-approved A stars, waiting for news is stressful. Every year, the vagaries of the admissions system see those who may seem shoo-ins on paper turned down, while Hail Mary candidates are graciously accepted. Nothing is a given.That’s true for students, anyway. When it comes to college principals, such surprises are rare indeed. While the powers that be have done everything to disrupt the old-fashioned “prep school, public school, Oxbridge” conveyor belt for students, the new elite of modern Britain continue to trudge dutifully from roles in the Labour Party, as luvvie human rights lawyers, charity bosses or Left-wing media panjandrums, into college top jobs. Oxford and Cambridge have become a sort of Blairite donkey sanctuary where members of the soft-Left can be put out to grass.Take the inevitable case of Dorothy Byrne, who has been “editor-at-large” of Channel 4 since stepping down as its head of news and current affairs last March. From September, she will be the president of Murray Edwards College in Cambridge, taking over from Dame Barbara Stocking, the former chief executive of Oxfam.She will, no doubt, have plenty to talk about at high table. It is easy to picture her fellow college heads Anthony Grabiner, Chris Smith and Sally Morgan, all ennobled by Labour, chuckling as Byrne recounts the time she called Boris Johnson a “known liar”. No doubt she can’t wait either to catch up with the three Cambridge college heads who’ve worked for the BBC. (It’s the neo-Prohibitionist and Master of Trinity College Dame Sally Davies I feel sorry for. How painful it must be for the former “nanny-in-chief” to watch people who ought to know better loosening their belts as they chuck down claret and beef Wellington.)Away from the Fens, Oxford colleges boast two Labour peers, a former Lib Dem peer, a BBC bigwig and Dame Helen Ghosh, whose time as director-general of the National Trust marked the start of the woke row at the institution. At least Alan Rusbridger, once editor of the  and now principal of Lady Margaret Hall, is shortly to follow his fellow Lefty hack Will Hutton, late of Hertford College, on to pastures new. Among the “projects” Rusbridger has to fall back on is a place on Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook “supreme court”. It seems he may be about to become the first person to leave academia in order to spend more time pointlessly pontificating while being ignored by a young man in a hoody.The idiosyncrasies of Oxbridge admissions are one of its great strengths. At interview, world-leading experts – the type of people who should be in charge, and at many institutions thankfully still are – pose teasers designed not to trick applicants but to assess the rigour of the brain behind the grades. The intention is to look beyond the superficial in search of talent and aptitude.  Shouldn\u0027t the same approach be taken for college heads? Could there be more scientists? Is it about time somebody to the Right of Chris Patten, a Tory so wet he makes the Atlantic look like the Sahara, got a job? Would more business leaders help secure funding and facilitate the ties between university and industry that have proved so fruitful in the hunt for Covid vaccines?In the meantime, I’ll settle for anything that staves off the wearyingly predictable day that some once-great college opts for Professor Polly Toynbee as principal.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lateral flow tests not panacea pandemic","story":"In the UK, lateral flow testing for coronavirus is being rolled out to wide swathes of the population, sold as the panacea to the pandemic. The government is planning to expand community testing using lateral flow tests, giving key workers who can’t work from home lateral flow tests twice a week. On Sunday, it was reported that the government spent £75m flying in lateral flow tests  that missed half of Covid cases. The population covered by the tests includes asymptomatic school children, university students, hospital staff, various other workers, and the general public. How we use these tests will determine whether they increase or decrease the spread of coronavirus. It’s true that we do have a problem with undetected coronavirus. Test and Trace detects less than a quarter of people with coronavirus, when compared to numbers estimated by large surveillance studies. But the obvious solution to this problem is to improve Test and Trace, rather than introduce a completely separate testing system, with a much less accurate test.Why is this? The primary problem is that lateral flow testing is not wholly accurate. The Liverpool pilot of community mass testing found the Innova lateral flow test used in the UK misses more people with coronavirus than it detects three in five are missed by this test. Sure, it’s more effective in people with a high viral load, but misses a third of them too. This was compared to the slower PCR test used in Test and Trace, which detected the cases that the lateral flow test missed. Worst of all, community testing with lateral flow tests could also build entirely new chains of transmission: Most people with coronavirus who take  the lateral flow test will have been falsely reassured with an incorrect negative test result. That false reassurance may lead to those people taking more risks, for example deciding to visit friends or relatives, or to break lockdown restrictions when they otherwise wouldn’t have. That change in behaviour starts new chains of transmission to those they meet. Another way of accidentally starting new chains of transmission is if people with coronavirus symptoms decide to use the more convenient lateral flow tests, rather than the slower Test and Trace PCR tests. For every ten people with symptomatic coronavirus who decide to do this, four people will have their coronavirus missed due to the less accurate test, and will be falsely reassured and start new chains of transmission. If these new chains of transmission created by lateral flow tests outnumber the broken chains, then using lateral flow tests will increase the spread of coronavirusIt’s crucial to note that how lateral flow tests are used will determine whether they break more chains of transmission than they build. For example, workplace testing of NHS workers may be very beneficial overall - here the beneficial effects of early identification are likely to outweigh any negative effects of false reassurance. Contrast that with the more dangerous uses, the test-to enable situations, where people are allowed more risky behaviour on the basis of negative test results. For example easing entry restrictions into care homes on the basis of lateral flow negative results. These uses are bound to increase transmission overall, particularly for a test that misses half of people with coronavirus.Scientists voicing concerns about poor test performance have sometimes been criticised as mischief-making, for undermining government messaging - yet this overlooks the very nature of science and public service. We have to be truthful about the limitations of tests, so people can see for themselves why relying on a negative result from an Innova lateral flow test would be dangerous. Evangelistic, over-zealous rhetoric about screening tests has caused much damage in the past and it is sad to see it happening again. When Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng claims that lateral flow testing can give iniduals “complete confidence that their workplace is safe”, this will in truth build new chains of transmission, rather than breaking them.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"schools closed new lockdown when reopen uk areas covid","story":"All primary and secondary schools have closed, after England moved into a third national lockdown.The Prime Minister said schools will need to offer remote learning until at least mid-February and GCSE and A-level exams face cancellation for a second year.Only vulnerable children and children of key workers will be allowed to attend schools for face-to-face learning, and early years settings such as nurseries will remain accessible.Boris Johnson said the new measures were necessary: because we have to do everything we possibly can to stop the spread of the disease.However, Mr Johnson remains very cautious about the timetable, with restrictions being lifted as a gradual unravelling. Those entitled to free school meals will continue to receive them during closures, and more devices will be distributed to help remote learning, according to Mr Johnson.The Government had insisted schools would remain open only a day before the new measures were announced, reassuring parents it was safe to send their children back for the start of term on January 4.But the move prompted backlash from four national teaching unions, who called for the delay seen across London to apply to all schools in England amid concerns the new strain of Covid-19 poses a threat to teachers.Anne Longfield, the Children\u0027s Commissioner for England has called for teachers to be vaccinated as a priority.The  reported on January 9 that education experts warned that Britain needed to massively expand its army of tutors to stave off the long-term economic damage of Covid-19 from lost learning.The Department for Education (DfE) said children with at least one parent or carer who was a critical worker could attend class - even if parents were working from home.It came after concerns were raised about the risks of transmission of Covid-19 amid reports that more than half of pupils were onsite in some primary schools.Matt Hancock said on Jan 11 that Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, will be sending out 500,000 laptops to vulnerable children to ensure they can access remote lessons.The Prime Minister told MP\u0027s that 560,000 laptops were distributed in 2020, but this still falls short of the 1.5m pupils that Ofcom estimates are without digital devices in their homes, on which they can learn.A DfE spokesperson said: Schools are open for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers. We expect schools to work with families to ensure all critical worker children are given access to a place if this is required.If critical workers can work from home and look after their children at the same time then they should do so, but otherwise this provision is in place to enable them to provide vital services.The DfE also said that schools were expected to strongly encourage vulnerable children to attend class.Vulnerable children could include pupils who may have difficulty engaging with remote education at home due to a lack of devices or a quiet space to study, according to the advice.But Government guidance says parents who choose to keep children out of class will not be penalised.The new lockdown measures mean the entire country will be subject to the same tougher measures, including the closure of all schools. This means the tier system is not currently in place.Every school had been instructed to draw up plans to ensure children continue to receive an education even if they have to stay at home.Mr Johnson said on the announcement of closing schools: I want to stress that the problem is not that schools are unsafe to children.The problem is that schools may nonetheless act as vectors for transmission, causing the virus to spread between households.Read more on the previous tier system: All schools will remain closed until mid-February, with the possibility that these measures could be extended further.This means most secondary school pupils will stay at home until at least the February half-term. Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, announced on January 6 that GCSE, A-Level and AS exams will not take place this summer. Exams will be replaced by teacher assessments, with Mr Williamson saying that the government will put our trust in teachers, rather than algorithms. The Education Secretary has also stated that the Department for Education and Ofqual had already worked up a range of options. Details are currently being finetuned, but it will be a form of teacher-assessed grades, with training and support provided to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently across the country.When schools reopened in September the Government published 25,000 words of guidance explaining how school children and staff should be kept safe.Older children will be encouraged to avoid close contact with one another. Teachers are not restricted to a single bubble, but are urged to stay at the front of any classroom to reduce contact. In class, pupils must sit spaced out side-by-side and facing forward.The use of the staff room by teachers is also meant to be “minimised”. Schools must contact local health protection teams immediately so those in close contact with the child can be traced. Currently, pupils in a bubble, year groups and (very rarely) the entire school could be asked to self-isolate. A mobile testing unit could also be sent to a campus. Schools will be offered serial testing of close contacts of staff and pupils who test positive to negate the need for entire year groups to self-isolate at home.Teachers who help a child with symptoms do not have to self-isolate unless they develop symptoms themselves. However, they should thoroughly wash their hands and wear PPE while with the child. The area where someone suspected of having Covid-19 has been must then be intensively cleaned.If a parent insists a child with symptoms should attend school, the headteacher can refuse to take the pupil if they believe there is a threat to others.Staff will also supply and promote the use of tissues as part of the “catch it, bin it, kill it” technique to control germs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sir david attenborough become 5g hologram project show benefits","story":"Sir David Attenborough will be projected through an app so users can see him describing the hidden life of plants in high-definition on their smartphones.The nonagenarian naturalist is to become a 5G hologram as part of a government-backed project to show off the benefits of mobile technology.The app is due to be launched alongside the release of Sir David’s BBC Green Planet series early next year.Under current plans, the app will allow users in designated 5G spots to project Sir David on their phone screens alongside life-like footage of the plants he is describing, which will be supplied by Kew Gardens.The project, run by production company Factory 42, has been funded by a £2.3million taxpayer grant from the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, as part of a £200 million fund to showcase the technological advances 5G will enable.As well as being much faster the 4G signal, 5G allow phones and devices to send far greater amounts of data enabling a host of new technologies such as high-definition live-stream filming as well as automated drones and vehicles.The funding comes after a year where the next generation of mobile phone signal has become the focus of conspiracy theories during the pandemic.Last year, over 60 5G phone masts were burned down due to social media theories claiming they spread the coronavirus.Other projects to receive Government funding include plans to have driverless taxis taking people around the stadium of League One football side MK Dons, as well as drone deliveries of goods to its hospitality areas. Another scheme is for 5G instant replays of sports events at London’s O2 arena, which will allow spectators to instantly re-watch key moments of the action on their phones.Other projects to secure funding are for 5G enabled drones on construction sites and high definition broadcasting from extreme locations such as inside caves and along cliff-tops for nature documentary makers.Speaking about the David Attenborough hologram app, Matt Warman, the Minister for Digital Infrastructure, said: “This cutting-edge app, fronted by broadcasting legend Sir David Attenborough, is set to be an inspiring example of how new technology can reconnect us with the natural world whilst demonstrating the power of 5G to a huge new audience.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"enough children living temporary housing","story":"NewsEnough children living in temporary housing to fill  primary schoolsThe Local Government Association is urging the Government to implement a six-point plan to boost the welfare system increase the number of homesmirrorShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  JAN NewsTens of thousands of kids are in temporary accommodation \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The average primary has about  pupils – meaning  schools would be needed to house all the youngsters with no home of their own. The LGA said the figures showed “the urgent need for the Government to ensure the building of more affordable homes to rent, which is central to our recovery from the pandemic”. Housing spokesman David Renard said: “Living in temporary accommodation is disruptive and challenging for children and their families in normal times.  “These pressures will be being compounded by going into another lockdown, and on top of that some are unable to attend school.”The LGA unveiled a six-point plan, including maintaining the £-a-week rise in Universal Credit beyond April, making it easier for councils to buy empty properties, and building , social homes for rent every year.Other measures include reviewing the impact of the benefits cap, “ensuring that councils have enough resources to support households at risk of homelessness” and speeding-up plans to scrap “no-fault” evictions. Mr Renard said implementing the recommendations “would give councils a better chance of being able to move homeless children into permanent accommodation and also minimise the risk of other households becoming homeless as a result of the pandemic”.He added: “This should include ensuring the welfare system is able to support families facing hardship and increasing the housing supply available to councils, as well as powers for councils to acquire empty properties and build much-needed social housing.” District Councils’ Network spokesman Giles Archibald said: “Many families were already struggling to keep a roof over their heads before the coronavirus struck. “This has now been made much worse by the pandemic, and councils have long warned that the impact of job losses and falls in income would force more families into hardship and homelessness. “Living in temporary accommodation is challenging for families, particularly whilst schools and many workplaces are having to remain closed during this lockdown – and my heart goes out to those who are trying to manage this dficult situation.” Housing charity Shelter said “emergency measures are vital, but they are short term solutions”. Chief executive Polly Neate said: “It’s horric to think so many children are having to cope with the added trauma of homelessness during this pandemic.

And providers were accused of cashing in on poverty by getting taxpayers’ money for the parcels but sending supplies worth as little as £.Campaigner Marcus Rashford branded the packages “not good enough”. Labour ’s Angela Rayner said: “Into whose pockets is the money for free school meals going ”For parents struggling to feed their children as ­lockdown goes on even longer, the meagre food ­packages dished out by private firms have added insult to injury. What is your view  Have your say in the comments section And there were furious claims a range of companies were cashing in on poor kids by getting taxpayers’ money to deliver the aid but handing over paltry supplies that cost much less. Footballer and anti-poverty campaigner Marcus Rashford joined the growing chorus of anger and ­families shared pictures showing their woeful packages – which contained food wrapped in plastic money bags. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: “Into whose pockets is the money for free school meals going  Who is ­profiteering from our hungry children ” One of the firms who sent out food apologised and another admitted the contents were not enough to feed kids. The scandal was revealed when one parent, calling herself ­Roadside Mum, posted a picture of her package, which she claimed contained only £ worth of food – instead of the £ worth she could have got under the ­Government’s voucher scheme. It contained two potatoes, a tin of beans, eight cheese sandwiches and some other household items which she claimed were due to last for  days.  The mum said: “Issued instead of £ vouchers. I could do more with £.” Children’s Commissioner for England Anne Longfield branded some of the packages “paltry, cheap and demeaning”. She said: “Whoever thinks it is OK to send out bits of vegetables and fruit like this is very wrong. Imagine thinking the saving to be made on half a carrot was worth it.”  Provider Chartwells, which is owned by Compass Group PLC, was hauled before ­ministers yesterday as No  branded some food parcels “completely unacceptable”. Speaking of the mum who complained about having just £ worth of food, it said: “For clarity this shows five days of free school lunchesand the charge for food, packing and­ distribution was actually £. and not £ as suggested. “However, in our efforts to provide thousands of food parcels a week at extremely short notice we are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance.”  The firm insisted it would “enhance” its parcels and also refund the cost of those that had not met its high standards. Another provider, ­Cater Link Ltd, sent mum Kerry Wilks a package containing a loaf of bread, three yoghurts, a tin of beans, tuna, two ­potatoes, fruit and cheese. The widow, from Redcar, Cleveland, claimed families were being treated “like dirt”. Mum-of-three Kerry, , added: “Even the teaching staff were quite ­embarrassed by giving them out.”  Cater Link managing director Neil Fuller said: “We have listened to ­feedback from parents and pupils, and in some cases it is clear our parcels have fallen short. We have reviewed our current food parcels, enhancing the contents.” Elaine Stacey, , from Reading, claimed her food parcel was “worth £” to feed her -year-old son for a week.  The carer said: “I almost thought I’d have to go and steal food.” Christa Lee, , from Bournemouth, said her daughter, , picked up a food package which included a third of an onion, tiny portions of cheese and soup powder in bank coin bags. She said: “This tells our children that they do not matter.”  Simon Young, of Cheltenham, Glos, received a food box worth just £ and containing little more than bread and ham to feed daughter Lola, , for a week, but said they will be luckyit lasts three days. Manchester United star Rashford said the supplies were “just not good enough”. Labour leader Keir Starmer asked: “Where is the money going ” Food parcels are distributed as No did not have time to set up a new voucher scheme before this lockdown. Schools have been told to use their own catering team or an outside provider for the packages. It is not known how much firms are being paid for parcels as contracts are awarded by heads and local ­authorities rather than centrally.

The current National Living Wage – the legal minimum – is just £. an hour, falling to £. for those aged between  and , and just £. for those aged  to . Citizens UK executive director Matthew Bolton said: “Whilst some employers are really struggling, supermarkets are experiencing bumper sales – yet not a single major supermarket pays all staff and contractors theLiving Wage.“It is unacceptable.” Fair pay campaigners pointed to the gulf in wages between ordinary workers and company bosses. They called on industry chiefs to sign-up to the Living Wage Foundation and pay employees its independently-calculated rate, which applies to all age groups. High Pay Centre executive director Luke Hildyard said: “Market forces might suggest that the going rate for CEOs runs into millions of pounds, while for supermarket workers it isnapost enough for them to live on, but when this seems so at odds with peopleaposs sense of fairness and the interests of society as a whole, we should questionit should be the only determinant of pay levels. Labour and the shop workersapos union Usdaw called for an hourly rate of “at least £ an hour”.Shadow Business Secretary Ed Miliband said: Every worker should be paid a fair wage they can live on.“Itaposs just wrong that so many of our key workers, including in sectors like supermarkets and care, are being asked to survive on low pay. Labour strongly supports a Real Living Wage of at least £ an hour. “As we rebuild our country and economy after coronavirus, we cannot just go back to business as usual. We owe the workers of our country an obligation to enable them to be paid a wage they can live and bring up their family on. Usdaw general secretary Paddy Lillis said: “Millions of low-paid workers have provided essential services to help ensure the country is fed, healthy and safe through the pandemic and will continue to do so.

With schools closed and the country in lockdown, the hot meal provision for children who qualy for free school meals is no longer available. But the budget to provide an alternative is. Depending on the local authority, that budget ranges from between £ - £ a week per child.Some local authorities have chosen to give parents supermarket vouchers, but a large number seem to have inexplicably plumped for half a loaf of bread, a couple of pieces of fruit, a single potato and a can of tuna instead.The Department for Education published its own guidelines for free school meals provisions back in . They recommended two kinds of carbs, with at least one being wholegrain. Three dferent kinds of veg. Three dferent kinds of fruit. A daily portion of meat or fish or beans or eggs. A daily portion of a dairy-based protein or alternative for children with dferent dietary needs. Meat or poultry at least three days a week. And some savoury crackers. What is your view  Have your say in the comments section For the companies involved to attempt to write this off as an isolated incident is an insult to the thousands of recipients of similarly shoddy packages. There seems to be a prevalent train of thought thatyou’re in poverty you should be ‘grateful’ for any help you get. And heartbreakingly, people are so broken by their circumstances and they value themselves so little that they are ‘grateful’. But it is conveniently forgotten that all of us are taxpayers, all of us are contributing to the coffers that are paying for these piteous parcels. I have spent the last seven years giving talks to ious organisations and political party conferences begging them to put dignity and active listening at the centre of everything they do. Ask people what their needs are and respond accordingly, rather than Marie Antoinette or Ebeneezer Scrooge all over it. People in dficult situations are no less deserving of a decent meal and adequate nutrition than anyone . The vouchers were a great idea. And despite what some people might be ly claiming, they were blocked from being spent on age restricted products, like alcohol, cigarettes, or even a paring kne to peel potatoes with.  But despite this restriction, mouthpieces on social media with their own austerity agendas claimed that they were widely abused. But the demonisation of the poor and working class in this country has been in plain sight for years now. Programmes like Benefits Street, Jeremy Kyle, ill fortune as gladiator style entertainment. It undermined a very large segment of our society, generally without the means, media access and mainstream s to speak up and tell their own stories about who they - we - really are.Questions are being asked now, about how these contracts came about, why they haven’t been overseen, whether this nutrient-deficient box of sadness was ill thought through or worse, very carefully planned to maximise profit margins at the expense of people who likely wouldn’t ever be able to raise their voices loud enough to complain about it. If that’s the case, the catering companies underestimated the inherent decency of our society, and the willingness amongst the majority of us to fight for the most vulnerable. Yes, we are exhausted. Yes, we are bewildered by this pandemic and all of the associated cronyism and mixed messaging and loneliness and desperation.But we are also, at our core, inherently just and good, and despite the ides that splinter through our once great nation, we have the power to unite and make a dference. Many schools have already decided, in the last  hours, to revert back to the voucher scheme. Now we need them all to follow suit. If school catering staff are being paid already to package up these paltry poverty picnics, why can’t they be paid to make the usual standard hot school lunches, portion them into tupperwares, and provide the original hot meal provision to be reheated at home  "},{"url":null,"title":"poorest families face another damaging","story":"NewsPoorest families face another damaging decade without urgent action, warns damning reportThe Joseph Rowntree foundation found families already in poverty were the worst affected by Covid- - as they were most likely to hold frontline jobsmirrorShareCommentsByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN NewsAlready struggling families have been hit hardest by the virus \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It said ministers must make tackling poverty an economic priority in  or they risk being defined by a record of worsening hardship.This includes keeping the £ weekly uplt to Universal Credit payments beyond the end of March and extending the uplt to those on legacy benefits.JRF Director Helen Barnard said: “It is a damning indictment of our society that those with the least have suffered the most before the pandemic and are now being hit hardest once again by the pandemic.“The Government must now make the right decisions to avoid another damaging decade.“It’s unacceptable that certain groups are bearing the brunt of the economic impact of Covid- and are now reeling from the latest blow of this third lockdown.”"},{"url":null,"title":"uk troops should stay afghanistan","story":"NewsUK troops should stay in Afghanistan while peace talks take place, say peersBritish Forces have not been in a combat role in the country for six years but a House of Lords committee says their presence boosts the Afghan government during negotiations with the TalibanmirrorShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  JAN NewsPeers say UK troops should remain until peace talks are complete \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

NATO troopsapos presence is “essential to the Afghan government’s military strength and negotiating position”, a House of Lords Committee says. The Government is also urged to shape its own policy on the war-torn nation rather than simply following America. The committee calls on ministers to “urgently” engage with US President-elect Joe Bidenaposs incoming White House administration. A total of  British servicemen and women were killed in Afghanistan from the start of the conflict to oust the Taliban in . UK troops withdrew from a combat role in December .  But about a thousand British troops remain in advisory, monitoring and training roles with NATO – and peers want them to stay until peace talks in Doha between the Afghan government and the Taliban have concluded. The House of Lords International Relations and Defence Committee says in a report published today: “The ongoing presence of US and NATO troops in Afghanistan is essential to the Afghan government’s military strength and negotiating position at the talks in Doha.“The report emphasises the urgency of UK engagement with the incoming Biden Administration on Afghanistan. “The UK must make clear to the US and NATO allies the crucial role they play in maintaining the Afghan government’s leverage in the peace talks and must play in Afghanistan until a peace deal is reached.” The committee claims the “UK has shown little inclination to exert an independent voice on policy on Afghanistan and has followed the lead of the US”. Peers say there were “few traces of a coherent UK policy approach to Afghanistan” and urge “the UK to call for a multi-national approach to Afghanistan within NATO, focusing on the UK’s objectives of regional stability, counter-terrorism and countering narcotics production and trafficking”. Committee chairwoman and Tory peer Baroness Joyce Anelay said: “This is a critical time for Afghanistan, with peace talks in Qatar having resumed over the weekend and an unacceptably high level of violence continuing to afflict an already poor and unstable country.  “The Government must engage urgently with the incoming Biden administration on the strategy for Afghanistan, and emphasise to the US and to NATO allies the importance of their ongoing presence in Afghanistan until a peace deal is reached. “The Government should be front and centre in calling for a multinational approach to Afghanistan within NATO, addressing regional stability, counter-terrorism and countering narcotics production and trafficking.” Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey said: “After all our Forces have sacriced in Afghanistan, the UK and NATO must see the job through.

It’s crass, offensive and he should apologise.” But a spokeswoman for British Gas owners Centrica said Mr Bateman’s remarks were “taken out of context” and criticism of them was “utter nonsense”. She said: “This is a desperate attempt by the GMB to distract from the fact  per cent of our company have signed up to our new terms and want to move forward.” A GMB spokesman also compared Mr Bateman to David Brent, the Ricky Gervais character in The Office, for spouting management gibberish.  On getting into a fight with the GMB, Mr Bateman said: “We might feel better by fighting but we don’t net net win.

I want to see my mother again, she’s , she could be dead next month, she told WalesOnline. Have you been fined for breaching lockdown  Let us know in the comments section  Mrs Richards said she was mortied and caught off guard when police stopped them during their journey home from the Picton Court Care Home, Porthcawl.I feel like I’m living in some sort of dystopian novel after what happened.  According to guidelines on the Welsh Government website, outdoor visits to care homes are allowed under alert level  restrictions for compassionate reasons. Such visits cannot take placethere is an outbreak of Covid- at the home.Compassionate reasons for visiting someone include checking-in on someone because they are suffering physically or mentally, or from bereavement or due to concerns with their general wellbeing or welfare.Indoor visits are allowed during exceptional circumstances, for example end of le visits. The care provider can ultimately decide whether visits are allowed to a care home and they must ensure risk assessments, social distancing and safety measures are in place. Mrs Richards claimed the police officer who issued the fine was pedantic and inflexible when she explained she had been visiting her mother, Decima Minhinnick, who suffers from vascular dementia and other health issues. A police lady flagged us down and I thought aposOh right, they’re policing the area, that’s fineapos. So I explained to her that we were going home, we’d been to Picton Court visiting my mother but she said this was a non-essential visit. She said ‘We’d all like to knock on our mother’s window to see them but you can’t do that,’ and I was totally gobsmacked. I was angry. She just would not listen to any protestations and so she said aposYou’re going to be issued with a £ fixed penalty fineapos.  Mrs Richards said the couple had arranged the visit to Picton Court Care Home in advance with the permission of staff and spoke to her mother, Decima, through the window of her room, on the ground floor of the home. We were outside in the car park. We don’t see anyone, basically, my husband has asthma. She went on: I do not want to pay this fine, said Mrs Richards. It’s not about the  quid, it’s about the principle and I want to go on seeing my mother. Now I feel asI’m breaking the law by driving down there to see her.

And those under  made up . per cent of deaths in the spring, whereas this winter they account for only . per cent of deaths.Have you been affected by coronavirus directly  Let us know in the comments belowMore good news is the survival chances of hospital patients with Covid- are thought to be higher now than at the beginning of the pandemic thanks to treatments such as the steroid dexamethasone. Test and Trace has also changed its definition of ‘close contact’, which was previously defined as anyone who has been within two metres of someone for a single period of at least  minutes. Now it is anyone who has been within two metres of someone for more than  minutes, whether in a single period or cumulatively over the course of one day.  When it comes to public compliance, data from transport app Citymapper shows people living in London, Manchester and Birmingham are planning more journeys by public transport now than in the first lockdown. Journeys during the first lockdown fell to less than  per cent of pre-pandemic levels compared to just under  per cent of pre-pandemic levels in the third lockdown.Dr David Strain, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter, told the Sun of potential hypotheses as to why the trend is shting. Speaking of a change in the virus, he told the Mirror: If we imagine everyone has a certain threshold of viral tolerance. If the amount of virus they come into contact with is above that threshold the exposure turns into the disease. Now the virus is more virulent, you need much lower amount to cause the infection, therefore people who previously were unlikely to catch the disease beforeare suddenly vulnerable.  On Tuesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UKaposs Covid- pandemic is at its worst point and hospitals wonapost get quieter until February. Hancock told the Downing Street press conference: Weaposre at the worst point of this pandemic.

The -year-old says the three-bed house was a “real do-er upper” with a kitchen covered in damp and mould, with uneven floors. The décor wasn’t to Amberley’s taste either, with s-style powder blue anaglypta wallpaper and salmon pink curtains in one room. Having bought the property in December  for £,, Amberley has lived there for three years while slowly chipping away at the makeover. When the UK went into lockdown in March last year, Amberley, an office manager, was furloughed and finally had enough time to focus on the house. The glow-up of the home included merging the kitchen and dining room into an open-plan space and redecorating the bedrooms, lounge and bathroom, as well as working on the garden.The kitchen was completely ripped out and replaced with fresh white units – bought second-hand on eBay for £ – with wooden floor replacing the old black and white patterned floor tiles.The living room fireplace is perhaps the most impressive transformation, going from a dated black grate with a mahogany mantelpiece and cream patterned tiles to a stunning cream mantel with a black coal fireplace at the base. The bedrooms are also unrecognisable after Amberley completely redecorated two of them with on-trend wooden furnishings, with the third box room converted into a work space.Meanwhile, the garden was transformed using fresh paving slabs and pebbles leading to a seating area – right in the middle of a summertime sun-trap. Even the garage got the golden treatment, going from a standard storage space to a stylish laundry room. Amberley estimates the renovations would have taken two years’ worth of weekend work had it not been for her being furloughed. Thanks to her efforts, the property value has increased by £,. “I was drawn to nothing but the fact the house was so light and bright with good-sized windows,” Amberley told Jam Press. “Everything  was atrocious and, being a first-time buyer, I had no idea what lay ahead to improve it.  “I lived in the house for three years just trying my best to bear it by painting walls ‘for now’, but after saving some money I was able to start renovations – starting with the kitchen wall knock-through, which was done by a professional weeks before lockdown. “After lockdown happened, I was stuck with all the time in the world and knew I had to sort my act out, and got planning the rest of the renovations. “It really kept me busy to say the least. “My family are based in Devon and abroad so I didn’t see them at all but I used to call them for DIY tips and used YouTube a lot for decorating advice.”The structural work was the most expensive part, setting Amberley back £, to have a steel bar fitted for the kitchen diner knock-through, but she was otherwise able to cut corners. She said: “I knew the kitchen would take up a lot of my budget and didn’t want to spend a fortune on units via a high street brand which I’d be paying off each month. “I researched my options, which took forever, but in the end found a second-hand kitchen on eBay which belonged to a local family in Wirral who were upgrading their own kitchen. “I made the purchase for  units for £, which was a really risky move and meant having it fitted was challenging and the hardest part of the renovations – but so worth it in the end, and it means I’m not in kitchen debt.”  Although she had to battle damp walls, cavity problems, faulty electrics and uneven flooring, Amberley described working on her home during lockdown as a “huge blessing in disguise” that kept her mind preoccupied. She said: “Pre-lockdown, my le was all about work and seeing loved ones – then suddenly it became all about buying Polyfilla and drills. “Until  I didn’t know I would ever be capable of any form of DIY or decorating, it’s really been a matter of sink or swim.  “The very fact I didn’t do it before lockdown shows how little time I had and how much of my le was taken up by other things. “It’s now become a hobby as I refine the finishing touches.” Amberley now plans to take a well-deserved break from renovating. She added: “There’s always something to do and the list keeps growing, but for the most part it’s all done.

There is ato more misery in the North West, where places such as Liverpool and Knowsley, which were major Covid hotspots in the first wave, see their week-on-week case rates more than double in todayaposs Public Health England figures. In Tuesdayaposs update of the latest Covid- case rates for every local authority area in England, the rate is expressed as the number of new cases per , people. Of the  local areas in England, have seen a rise in case rates, have seen a fall and one is unchanged, in the figures for the seven days to January . Scroll through the full list below to see where your are ranks in the latest figures Six authorities in the Liverpool City Region are in the top  local areas with the biggest surges in coronavirus rates. According to Knowsley Council, current rates of Covid- in the borough stand at , per , population and are continuing to rise - one of the highest rates in the whole of the UK. The  areas with the biggest week-on-week rise in rates  Knowsley Halton Liverpool Sefton St Helens Tendring Wirral Worcester Isle of Wight Bournemouth Christchurch  PooleBarking  Dagenham in London continues to have the highest rate in England, with , new cases recorded in the seven days to January  - the equivalent of ,. cases per , people.  This is up slightly from ,. in the seven days to January . Newham, also in London, has the second highest rate, up from ,. to ,., with , new cases. What is your view  Have your say in the comments section Knowsley in Merseyside has the third highest rate, up sharply from . to ,., with , new cases. Dr Sarah McNulty, Knowsleyaposs Director of Public Health, said while many people are doing everything they can to prevent the transmission of the virus in the area, it is clear that others need to treat the situation much more seriously. This comes after staff in one workplace, who were found to be socialising outside of the office and arranged a festive singalong, had an outbreak of the virus which saw  people become infected. In a y statement, Dr Sarah McNulty said: We are currently seeing alarmingly high rates of infection here in Knowsley and this is a huge concern.  Covid- is a potentially lethal illness which has already killed more than  people in the Liverpool City Region of which  were from Knowsley. While many people are doing everything they can to prevent the transmission of the virus, it is clear that others need to treat the situation much more seriously. We currently think the R number in Knowsley could be as high as .. That means that COVID- is widespread in our community. She warned residents to stay at home but said sadly it seems the case rates make it appear people were not following the rules.  Every time a resident leaves the house, they are increasing their chances of catching the virus or indeed passing it on,she said. People should be staying at home as much as possible and following the rules rigidly. Sadly, from looking at our rates, this clearly can’t be happening across the board. We are seeing examples of people blatantly breaking the rules. In one workplace we came across, staff had been socialising outside of the office and even arranged a festive singalong. Sure enough, there was an outbreak in that workplace and almost  people became infected in a very short space of time. Undoubtedly, those people then passed the virus on to their own families and friends, perhaps including vulnerable people. Was the ‘fun’ all really worth it   Whilst I am not suggesting that such behaviour us completely commonplace, it is a very clear indicator that not everyone is taking this situation as seriously as they should. Todayaposs figures, for the seven days to January , are based on tests carried out in laboratoriesand in the wider community . The rate is expressed as the number of new cases per , people. Data for the most recent four dayshas been excluded as it is incomplete and does not reflect the true number of cases. The list has been calculated based on Public Health England data published on January  on the Governmentaposs coronavirus dashboard.

The images reveal parents who rely on free school meals have been sent food worth just a few pounds to feed their children for several days. One distraught mum says she must now not pay a bill in order to buy food as the parcel is nowhere near enough to feed her autistic son. The scandal has sparked a national outrage, with Labour leader Keir Starmer branding the packages a disgrace, while footballer and child poverty campaigner Marcus Rashford said suppliers must do better. One firm responsible for distributing food parcels this evening apologised after an image of a paltry food parcel went viral. Chartwells admitted the quantity had fallen short in this instance. The company is one of a number of businesses that deliver food packages - although a large proportion of parents saying they would prefer to be given food vouchers. It said in a statement to The Mirror that we are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance. Have you received a similar food parcel  Let us know by emailing pictures to webnews@trinitymirror Here is a selection of the examples of food packages that Mirror readers have sent us Mum Lisa Siska, from the Isle of Wight, told The Mirror that the package will not be sufficient to feed her autistic son, who is  - meaning she will have to not pay a bill in order to buy more food. She said: This is disgusting itaposs not even worth £. I canapost feed my son on this he has autism and adhd and has texture issues with food. And she added: I will have to not pay a bill so I can buy more food. She said that she has previously received food vouchers, but was not given this option again.Shireen Chambers, from Hastings, shared a picture of a food box she had received, writing: This is what my nine-year-oldaposs school gave us for two weeks worth of meals. I canapost make a lot with it plus itaposs cost £ on a bus to go and collect it.  Lucy Geary, from Dorset, told The Mirror: I am a key worker, my children and I are in isolation now because they have been in contact with someone who has covid, so we will receive nothing until theyto school!

We had received vouchers in the past but that all seems to have stopped.  I didnapost take any pictures as I didnapost want to initially speak up but seeing others dealing with the same I feel now that itaposs not just us. It is only enough for a few days of food for the children as to the £ voucher was enough for at least a week to feed him. Itaposs simply not fair. I am a full time carer for my disabled partner and a full time dad to my two young children and I am only able to work part time and we are on the Universal Credit system. It simply isnapost right.  Zoe Mackay, from East Sussex, wrote: I would have requested the vouchers as before as this suits my child needs and choices more. What I received was so basic and half of what little was there my  year old will not eat! This has not helped me at all being a single mother on a very tight budget! Mum Rhea Cartlidge told the Mirror: This in no way replaces what we were receiving, which was £ per week, per child. Somebody must be profiting from this scheme, this time around and it certainly doesn’t make a weekaposs worth of lunches for my children. I’m wondering what is going on.  And another child was left wonderingher school had put her on a diet when she still felt hungry after eating from a school food parcel. Describing the contents of what she had received to keep her kid going for five days, the girlaposs mum tweeted: Iaposve decided to take this as a challenge bearing in mind that my children have the cooked school lunch. Day . I cooked her small portion of pasta. Chopped  blended the  toms  heated up, added  slices of chopped ham, tossed in the cooked pasta and cucumber strips on the side. For dessert she had the banana. For drink  bottle of the water. She was still hungry and asked why the school had put her on a diet.

Libby, , vanished in the early hours of February , , after enjoying a night out with friends. Despite weeks of painstaking attempts to find her, Libbyaposs body was discovered in the Humber Estuary by a fishing boat at Spurn Point on March , . The court heard how she had been wearing a gold necklace with an aposLapos on it when she was found, Hull Daily Mail reports. In October , Relowicz was charged with her rape and murder. Prosecution lawyer Richard Wright told the court that Libby and some of her housemates had begun the evening of Thursday, January , , at their shared home in north Hull. They moved to the home of another student nearby at around .pm to continue drinking before the night out.  All of those who saw her and interacted with her that evening thought that she was in good spirits and was enjoying her night, Mr Wright said. By around pm, the group walked to The Welly, a popular student nightclub, the court heard. Mr Wright said some of the group noticed how the cold January air had heightened Libbyaposs drunkenness, but that she was generally a happy drunk. Despite this, she was refused entry to The Welly nightclub, though the court heard she did not appear to be particularly annoyed by that and said she would walk home. But with a fair distance to get home and with snow on the ground, her friends instead put her into a taxi and told the driver to take her home, paying her fare in advance. Libby left her friends at just before .pm.  She was dropped off able to walk, albeit in an unsteady manner, Mr Wright said. But instead of heading to her front door, Libby instead began walking towards a group of young men waiting for their own taxi, falling to the ground as she did so. They helped her up, but she continued walking away from her house. The court heard how another group of students heard a woman crying outside their house and invited Libby inside. She was drunk and upset, but uninjured, the court heard. Though no one knew it yet, she had dropped her house keys, attached to a pink fluffy key ring, in the front garden of that house, Mr Wright said. A number of members of the public saw Libby and were concerned about her condition, the court heard. In front of a former nunnery, one woman saw her drunk and sobbing. When she asked Libbyshe was okay, she said she wanted tohome, but was actually walking in the wrong direction.  Two men on their way home from a darts match also saw Libby and stopped their car and tried to help her, Mr Wright said. Unfortunately they were unable to tell what she was saying, the court heard, and in her drunken state she became verbally aggressive, so the men decided to give up and drove away. Just before midnight, another woman also saw Libby sitting on the floor near a bus stop, crying and saying she wanted to go home.

They are very private about their relationship, but the Queen has made several loving comments about her husband over the years, once famously describing him as her constant strength and guide. Only know closest to them know what they are like as a couple behind closed doors, and they are always extremely professional towards each other at events and engagements - a sheer contrast to the younger royals like Meghan Markle, Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge who are often seen holding hands while out and about. But occasionally a member of the family or another insider gives us a tiny insight into what the couple are like, and itaposs very sweet. Designer Ian Thomas once recalled a moment the Queen flushed scarlet when her husband made a sweet comment about her as he walked past her dressing room. Speaking on Channel aposs Secrets of Royal Dressmakers, royal expert Ingrid Seward shared the sweet story. Mr Thomas was the Queenaposs dress designer for more than  years, and was adjusting the hem of his latest creation when the Duke walked past the room. Ingrid says: When he was doing the hem, Prince Philip walked through the Queen’s dressing room and said ‘hmh, nice dress’.  The Queen flushed scarlett. I always remember him telling me that story. She was just so thrilled to get the compliment from her husband. Mr Thomas opened his own couture business in Lowndes Street, Belgravia, in  and made many of the Queenaposs outfits under his own label. He also made pieces for other royal women, and in  he was awarded a Royal Warrant as dressmaker. The Queen is always perfectly dressed and her use of block colours and pretty pattern has worked for decades.  But not all the royals are quite as successful when it comes to fashion. During the programme the experts discuss Sarah Ferguson, with one person describing her as the worst dresser of all time. Ingrid said: “The worst dresser of all time was definitely Fergie. She looked great in her own clothes, in jeans and t-shirts but she was just a disaster in the fashion of the s because it was just too much for her.

Shocking pictures of hampers delivered to English families have sparked a wave of criticism, with parents expected to feed their children on just over £ of food. By contrast, parents in Wales have branded equivalent packages as outstanding, voicing their shock over what is happening across the border, Wales Online reports. An investigation has been launched in England after images shared online showed woefully inadequate free school meal parcels sent to families. One mum of three described how the food parcels she received from Caerphilly council have regularly contained fresh fruit and vegetables throughout the pandemic. Have you received a similar food parcel in England or Wales  Let us know by emailing pictures to webnews@trinitymirror She said: The food hamper we have had delivered in Wales since the beginning of the pandemic had been outstanding. I was quite shocked to see what England are receiving. It started with five micro meals, five fruit plus salad, yoghurt and desserts for each child. In December, we had waffles, chips, meat, fruit, vegetables, the usual five meals with salad and fruit per child plus a cracker and a selection box. Currently we are receiving  day hampers which include frozen veg, fresh veg, fresh salad, fresh potatoes, five frozen meals, frozen chips, chicken nuggets, block of cheese, five frozen desserts, fresh fruit, fish fingers and rice. A huge dference.  In England, one mum criticised the free school meals scheme after she claimed she was sent just a few pounds worth of food to feed her children for  days. It was claimed the image of a £ parcel contained just over £ worth of food. Posting the image on Twitter, user Roadside Mum said:  days jacket potato with beans,  single cheese sandwiches,  days carrots,  days apples,  days soreen,  days frubes. Spare pasta  tomato. Will need mayo for pasta salad. Issued instead of £ vouchers. I could do more with £ to be honest. Footballer and campaigner Marcus Rashford tweeted another picture and wrote:  days of food for  family... Just not good enough.  Then imagine we expect the children to engage in learning from home. Not to mention the parents who, at times, have to teach them who probably havenapost eaten at all so their children can... We MUST do better. England childrenaposs Minister Vicky Ford said she would be urgently look into the matter. The Department for Education wrote on Twitter: We have clear guidelines and standards for food parcels, which we expect to be followed. Parcels should be nutritious and contain a ied range of food. Chartwells, the company which the mum in England said provided the parcel, said it will investigate.  It said: Thank you for bringing this to our attention. This does not reflect the specication of one of our hampers. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the situation as a disgrace. He tweeted: The images appearing online of woefully inadequate free school meal parcels are a disgrace. Where is the money going  This needs sorting immediately so families donapost go hungry through lockdown. Free school meals have been provided in Wales including after the closure of schools in March and through the summer holidays. There has been some praise for the food hampers that are being handed out through schemes in some parts of Wales. Mum Aimee Stott, from Bridgend, has two sons aged six and eight. They receive a box every week and it even includes a recipe guide. She said: It also comes with a great handy recipe guide to tell you how to make the best of what you have got. I was horried to see alternatives in other parts of the UK, and feel exceptionally grateful right now we are under the Welsh Government. Parents of children who would normally qualy for free school meals have been given the option of food parcels or vouchers as schools close for remote learning. In some areas of Wales, such as Rhondda Cynon Taf, those eligible for free school meals receive a BACS payment from their local council rather than a packed lunch or hamper.

All adding up to a very British scandal. An apology, an official investigation and a Downing Street condemnation are the least we are entitled to expect – but the unanswered question is: how could this be allowed to happen in the first place  England and Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford again proves his incredible value as an anti-poverty campaigner by highlighting the delivery of meagre food parcels. All of us, not just the families feeling cheated, must be angrily inspired to stop this happening and build a fairer, better, decent Britain. To replace neglect with respect. Every child matters and deserves to be fed properly. Taxpayers also matter and our money must be spent efficiently and effectively, not wasted by private companies profiting from a pandemic at the price of social justice. Cynical stance Home Secretary Priti Patel exposes a lethal contradiction in the Government’s mishandling of the Covid emergency. It emerges from her inability to explain why this lockdown is lighter than the first, even though the second wave’s rapidly spreading mutant iant is killing more people and filling more hospital beds. Repeatedly focusing on the minority flouting laws obeyed by the majority is shaping into a cynical strategy by Boris Johnson and his Tories to sht blame for unacceptably high death rates on to the public.

An unnamed Perth player was unavailable after testing positive for Covid-.United selected the same team that finished the goalless draw at Aberdeen on January . That meant young Lewis Neilson retained his place at the back, while Dillon Powers stayed in midfield after replacing the crocked Peter Pawlett at Pittodrie, There was a spot on the bench for frontman Marc McNulty as he came back from injury.The McDiarmid men were first to threaten the opposition goal on seven minutes when Chris Kane’s cross to the back post was aimed at Murray Davidson, who got his boot to the ball couldn’t trouble keeper Benjamin Siegrist.The Tangerines soon settled, though, and took the lead with a wonderfully-worked opener just two minutes later.Nicky Clark was the supplier after the defence sat off and the Tangerines’ forward created room on the right side of the penalty area. He then cut back perfectly for Appere, whose sidefooted strike took a deflection on its way into the net.The visitors were on the front foot quickly, however, and Melamed tried but failed to beat Siegrist with a lob.The leveller was just delayed slightly, though, with St Johnstone’s Israeli striker getting off the mark for the McDiarmid men to make it - on  minutes. His header was a powerful one off David Wotherspoon’s corner that seemed to slip through Siegrist’s legs and nestle in the back of the net.Melamed was in the mood and had another effort saved by Siegrist before a poor clearance from Saints at the other end fell to United’s Shankland, who just found the angle for his strike to be too tight.Shankland was threatening again on the half-hour when he seemed to have a clear path to goal before Ali McCann, playing at right-back, did superbly to nick the ball off his feet before he could test goalie Clark.Unlike the other games between the sides this season, this match was a open affair and Saints scored again on  minutes.Kane was the man on target this time as the hosts failed to deal with another ball into the box. Melamed worked some magic out on the left before finding Wotherspoon, who twisted and turned before sending a brilliant delivery into the box that was nodded into the United net by Kane.That was all just a taster, however, for Shankland’s stunner.With the clock striking  minutes, there seemed to be little danger as United’s Appere made an interception near the halfway line. He quickly played the ball to his right to Shankland, who instead of racing up the line as expected looked up then embarrassed Clark with a fabulous chip.With the contest tied at -, the home side brought on Luke Bolton for Neilson and, a bit later, McNulty for Appere.If the Perth men were shocked by that incredible equaliser they didnt show it and kept looking for the winner, as did United.Wotherspoon, who was having a fine match for St Johnstone, went for goal with a freekick on the left edge of the penalty box and Siegrist had to punch the ball away.Stevie May and Scott Tanser came on for St Johnstone, replacing Kane and Callum Booth.The two subs nearly teamed up for a goal, with May driving into the United half before releasing Tanser, who drilled his shot low and inches wide of the far post. Tannadice then saluted Jim McLean for a second time, with another round of applause held on  minutes to mark the year of United#s Premier League title win under the great man#s leadership.Both teams kept plugging away until the end but just couldn#t be separated from each other.Dundee United: Siegrist, L.

They just had to go on and download their assignments and complete and submit them.“This time around they want to run a normal timetable online and they can log in and the teacher will be there during that time to teach them.“That is impossible here because it glitches and stutters the whole time. It’s completely unsustainable to continue to try and work this way.”Ruth said she is particularly concerned her son who is in S will not be able to interact with his teachers.EvenMicrosoft Teams was working perfectly across the country, we would still be struggling here.#“The school are very understanding and have reassured us he will not be badly affected as a result, as assignments can be downloaded and completed separately,” she said.“But it may well be that kids living in Kirriemuir will get to have whole periods interacting with their teacher but that’s just not something that’s available to us.”Ruth also said balancing home-learning with working from home as an estate administrator for the Glenprosen Estate was made impossible by the Teams outage.Home schooling update to be given in Scottish Parliament tomorrow\" title\"#Home schooling update to be given in Scottish Parliament tomorrow# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp home-schooling-update-to-be-given-in-scottish-parliament-tomorrow embed # secretoxCWhVeKh\" data-secret\"oxCWhVeKh\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"She added: “Yesterday’s fiasco was also hugely frustrating because I’m trying to work from home as well.“My son who is in S couldn’t download any of his assignments so yesterday was a completely wasted day in terms of school work.“My eldest managed to download a couple of assignments before it all went pear-shaped.“He worked on those and completed them within a few hours.

Each school will have its own approach to supporting children and young people in these circumstances.”At her daily briefing on Tuesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Microsoft issues were not specic to Glow and there were . million log-ins to the Education Scotland  on Monday.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: “Although all legal and regulatory responsibility for ensuring access to digital infrastructure is the responsibility of UK Ministers, the Scottish Government is committed to tackling gaps in broadband coverage in Scotland, to increasing digital participation and ensuring that all of Scotland is able to enjoy the social, cultural and economic benefits of the internet.“Building on the success of the Digital Scotland Superfast Broadband roll-out, our Reaching % programmewill ensure that everyone can access superfast broadband.

The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.”"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures a look back at 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In the years which followed, that death toll rose by thousands as people succumbed to radiation sickness.Among those who died was Sadako Sasaki, a pupil at Hiroshima’s Noboricho Elementary School, who developed acute leukaemia  years after being exposed to the radiation.While she was in hospital, she was inspired by the Japanese tradition that suggestssomeone makes a thousand origami cranes, their wish will come true. Sadako’s final days were spent folding paper cranes # hoping she would recover.After her death, her friends swore to build a monument in her honour, and their efforts led to the Children’s Peace Monument. Today, children around the world send more than  tonnes of paper cranes to the monument – more than the combined weight of Little Boy and Fat Man .The paper cranes are recycled by Peace Minds Hiroshima and sent to children around the world with Sadako’s story, raising awareness of the need for peace and nuclear abolition.Blessing the crane sculpture, Fr Ronald quoted from Pope Francis# World Day of Peace statement: #How many resources are spent on weaponry, especially nuclear weapons, that could be used for more signicant priorities such as ensuring the safety of iniduals, the promotion of peace and integral human development, the fight against poverty, and the provision of health care.#Global problems like the present Covid- pandemic and climate change have only made these challenges all the more evident. What a courageous decision it would be to establish a #Global Fund# with the money spent on weapons and other military expenditures, in order to permanently eliminate hunger and contribute to the development of the poorest countries.#Fr Ronald added: #On January , the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons will enter into force. This is a milestone on the road to peace.#The crane was gted to St Margaret’s peace garden by Pax Christi Scotland chairwoman Marian Pallister and crafted by Lochgilphead blacksmith Jack Campbell to remind us to continue to strive for peace, and as Pope Francis reminds us, #…to esteem the value and dignity of every person, to act together in solidarity for the common good, and to bring relief to those suffering from poverty, disease, slavery, armed conflicts, and discrimination#.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a creative blast from scotlands past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Low impact is maybe not as good as high impact but itrsquos better than no impact.ldquoSo anything that we might think can make a contribution to this massive effort to keep the virus under control, we will consider.Tougher restrictions on exerciseOne other possible area being looked at is the levels of interaction during exercise outdoors.During the first lockdown, people in Scotland were limited to one portion of outdoor daily activity.Speaking during the Scottish Governmentscoronavirusbriefing, Ms Sturgeon said: \"When we mean go out for essential exercise, thats what we mean ndash to get exercise, to get some fresh air.\"Weve not put limits on that like we did in the first lockdown.\"What we dont mean by essential exercise is going for a day trip with other people to the beach or to a park.\"I know that sounds harsh but it is really important right now that all of us stay at home as much as we possibly can.And Scotlandrsquos Chief Medical Officer said people should not be meeting outside to have coffees on park benches.He said: \"Go outside to take exercise.\"Its important that were still participating in physical activities.

to comply with the law.This new move could spark a similar response in Scotland and comes as four people were arrested after protesters clashed with police at an anti-lockdown demonstration.A small

Clearly, we will stay closely involved and be seeking the best possible outcome as we have done in the past.’TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOSpy camera scheme takes a step forwardThe group planning to set up a town centre security system in Campbeltown is considering applying to the government for funding.The Scottish Office has just made £ million available to pay for , new closed circuit television cameras to help fight crime in Scottish towns.The driving force behind Campbeltown’s proposed system, Kintyre Crime Prevention Panel, recently received an estimate for the cost of installing a system from a leading security firm. Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But it was a scary time for all of us.When this #Thought for the Week# was in the planning stage, we imagined that in our corner of Scotland, in Kintyre, we would be well rid of strict lockdowns, have a low position on the tier system and le would be getting back to some sort of normality. We are not there yet.When parents are bringing up children, they teach them by repetition – clean your teeth tidy your bedroom I love you, you are special.God, as our Father, does exactly the same. In the Bible, more than  times He says: #Do not be afraid# or phrases that mean this. Let us take this truth into the New Year with us.Let us all pray that soon we can say we are not afraid and what a dferent year  is.#Away, then all fears.

Here we spotlight some of the deserving stars that Prime Minister Boris Johnson applauds as “an inspiration to us all”.Last year brought to the fore a new breed of community champions# including those working in the NHS to treat coronavirus patients, scientists developing effective vaccines and key workers keeping essential services operating.These “ordinary people” who continue to go above and beyond have been recognised for sterling work delivered in extraordinary circumstances.The  New Years Honours has recognised champions of sport as well as stars of stage and screen but this year, more than ever, it is ordinary people who have been recognised alongside them. Among the deserving recipients are leading lights who have battled to save lives and keep the NHS afloat and those who have kept the country smiling by spreading kindness.The list includes medical experts as well as volunteers working with youngsters, the elderly and those with disabilities. Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.”Jacquie Winning’s award “recognises the achievements of everyone” at Forth Valley Sensory Centre following “an exceptionally challenging year”.The  year-old from Falkirk was recognised for going the extra mile to manage “wraparound” services to people with sensory loss during the pandemic “COVID- has been challenging for everyone, but more so for people with sensory loss. Those with hearing loss face challenges due to face masks and social distancing interfering with their ability to lip read.“Those with sight loss face signicant challenges managing to maintain physical distancing while undertaking essential trips out,” explained the MBE recipient.Jacquie’s support included providing Braille copies of virus information, establishing telephone, text and email befriending lelines to address isolation and producing podcasts providing vital updates.“The impact is that some of the most vulnerable people in society have been incredibly well supported during the most challenging of times. Thanks go to the dedication, enthusiasm and willingness to adapt by our team, volunteers and partners, and tremendous support of our board of directors.”Cabinet Office confirmation of Dr Tamas Szakmany’s award made him “astonished, touched and humbled”. The  year-old from Newport explained: “I thought I was doing my job like everybody . I didn’t think for one minute it would result in this. I’m really surprised. Once I was allowed to talk about it, the first thing I said was how fortunate I was to work with this team. “ was dficult professionally. Personally, I had many successes. It was a double-edged sword. The MBE is recognition for the enormous effort everyone has made to get us through the first wave. I hope we have similar success again.”The Royal Gwent Hospital critical care consultant, recognised for exceptional service to the NHS, spearheaded Welsh Critical Care Network response during the pandemic, rapidly disseminating information on lessons learnt via traditional and social media s. Filming his personal and professional le, he helped produce an emotional deeply personal documentary “Critical: Inside Intensive Care Coronavirus” episode, broadcasted by BBC Wales and included among American Society of Chest Physicians and Society of Critical Care Medicine teaching materials.A Belfast community worker is celebrating “the surprise of his le” after being honoured. Michael Briggs’ MBE was rewarded for services beyond the call of duty in the voluntary sector and community.“Even though we’ve hardly moved out of the office, it’s all been pretty busy,” explained the EastBelfast Community Development Agency Executive Director.“We’ve been managing our COVID programme, buying bulk food to get out to groups we support. We developed a network of groups delivering small packages to people who are vulnerable, shielding or in financial need.” The  year-old continued: “There are so many stories from older people who say ‘it’s just good to know people are thinking about us.”Thinking the honour email was promotional, Michael initially “didn’t actually take it seriously”.He revealed: “I nearly didn’t open it. Then I saw it was from the Cabinet Office. “For me, it’s about the efforts of other people as well.“So many people have been very supportive over the years. I’m the one who ends up getting the award, but other people have been involved in the success of my work.”A British Red Cross refugee support staff emergency responder initially thought his honour announcement email was spam! Golam Chowdhury was then “humbled” when his British Empire Medal was confirmed. “I had no idea I had even been nominated,” said the -year-old from Portsmouth.“It’s been challenging, both personally and professionally, but I am always amazed by human resilience and community spirit. Watching how people come together to support each other has been incredible.”Involved in active frontline response to COVID- in Hampshire as a Refugee Support staff member, Crisis Response South East tactical cell weekend coordinator and local Emergency Response, City of Sanctuary and Cycling UK volunteer, Golam received his accolade for outstanding achievements in healthcare during the virus pandemic.“I don’t do my job – or my volunteering – for praise,” said the father-of-two. “I do it because,the tables were turned and I was the one that needed help, then I would hope that there was someone out there to support me. “I’d like to dedicate my award to everyone in all communities who are helping others.”For more information on Honours recipients, go to gov.uk honours"},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 8 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

More than £ million of this we have been grateful to receive at Sightsavers.Money raised by players has been indispensable in helping Sightsavers to fund, in  alone, eye services for more than , people and more than  sight-saving cataract surgeries.In , funding also helped us to support the Covid- response. Children with disabilities kept learning throughout the pandemic, thanks to distance learning equipment and teacher training, PPE and hygiene kits.Children like Marie in Sierra Leone, who is blind and was in danger of being left behind when schools closed, until she was given a typewriter, a radio and assistance so that she could keep studying.So, once again, a big thank you to all the players in Scotland for your generosity.To find out about some of the lives being turned around by players# support, please head on over to www.sightsavers.org ppl or give Sightsavers a call on   .Dr Caroline Harper CBE, Sightsavers CEO.Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns on whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But, although customers’ usage of data more than doubled during the period, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m proud also of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.While BT Group continues to invest billions in these networks, we know that we can’t do this alone. We’ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland director.The  Covid crisis has prompted a greater sense of social cohesion and solidarity but it also exposed and exacerbated some of the barriers that blind and partially sighted people still face.Access to online shopping slots, a lack of essential health information in formats such as audio and braille, and confusion over whether social distancing allowed for blind and partially sighted people to still be guided added to the distress many felt.The first lockdown came out of the blue when we had little real-le experience of managing a national emergency, but it is now more essential than ever that we learn the lessons and ensure no one falls through the safety-net. Another period of enforced confinement during the winter months could hit some particularly hard.During the first lockdown, RNIB Scotland and other charities worked extremely hard to ensure the needs of the most vulnerable were met # at a time when even the most able in society were thrown by the suddenness and uncertainty the crisis had created.We negotiated set online shopping slots for people with sight loss, worked with public bodies to ensure the often vital information they put out was available in formats accessible to everyone, and claried the rules on guiding people with a visual impairment.These gains must be reinforced  we are ing to another nationwide lockdown.Currently, around , people are living in Scotland with signicant sight loss. Although most are over the age of , around , children and young people also have a visual impairment.The RNIB Helpline remains available on    and information continues to be broadcast on RNIB#s Connect Radio station. The RNIB Talking Book library posts and downloads thousands of titles in audio and other formats.Find out more at www.rnib.org.uk scotlandJames Adams, director, RNIB Scotland.As always in such matters, the UK-EU Brexit deal will iniably throw up more than a few surprises aside from the usual headlines heralding a British #victory# in negotiations.The fact that, for example, seed potatoes are not to be included in the deal will be deeply damaging to our rural economy. Scottish seed potato farmers are one of the biggest exporters of potatoes, used in the production of chips and crisps, in the world.The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, Edinburgh."},{"url":null,"title":"meet kintyres heroic davids","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Following enforced shut-down in March , CPH was able to re-open from September to December, one of very few cinemas in the UK to do so.At CGS, Mr Fyfe had to consider the iety of needs of the school#s children and their parents, his own needs and those of his family as he supported the entire network of staff, which includes several more Davids # music teacher David Cosgrove and maths teachers David Hamilton and David MacDonald.The heroic work of all the school#s staff through lockdown ranges from supervising vulnerable and key workers# children in the HUB and the challenges of online learning, to packing and distributing food parcels and delivering hot lunches in the community.As leboat coxswain, Mr Cox leads a crew which includes several heroic Davids # David Mullen, David Ward, David Campbell, David Colville and David Reid.Despite still having to attend all call-outs, in full kit and PPE, the team#s training came to a halt soon into the first lockdown, but they were eventually able toto training on a two-week rotation, one week on land, the other offshore.Having to physically distance proved incredibly hard for the crew, with multiple people required to safely carry out some tasks.Even small rescues using the Y-Boat # the vessel on top of the Severn-class leboat, not to be confused with the inshore rescue boat which is towed on a trailer # presented challenges given the amount of space on the boat.Masks were, and continue to be, worn inside the wheelhouse at all times and when working closely together outside on the deck.These Davids # and, of course, so many other people in the community # helped navigate the community through unprecedented and challenging circumstances in many dferent ways.If you know of a heroic David who deserves a shout-out, please let us know by emailing editor@campbeltowncourier or telephoning  .CAPTIONS:David Cox.

The Glasgow-born artist, who has ancestral links to Kintyre, died at the age of  in .In , with the help of pupils from the art department at Campbeltown Grammar School, he created the Ro-Ro sculpture of a birlinn-style boat which sits atop a stone plinth near the town#s New Quay to mark the restoration of the short-lived ferry service between Kintyre and County Antrim.It was unveiled in October  by Campbeltown Grammar School pupils Collette Sloey and Alan Downie at a ceremony attended by fellow pupils, members of the public, Argyll and Bute councillors and members of Campbeltown Community Council, as well as Mr Wyllie himself.In addition to tracking artworks which exist in the public domain and in public collections, the Mapping Memories project aims to include the locations and details of the artist’s major temporary installations, such as the Straw Locomotiveand the Paper Boatwhich now exist only in memory and archive material.Throughout the year leading up to what would have been Mr Wyllie’s th birthday on Hogmanay , the George Wyllie Estate will welcome public contributions to the project and will publish previously unseen material from the artist’s own archive.By visiting www.georgewyllie anyone can add audio or video recordings, text, photographs and film as well as the geographical location of the work about which they are posting.A second blog on the website called Just For Fun asks people to share the ways in which Mr Wyllie inspired them to get creative.Announcing the digital launch of the trail, the artist#s eldest daughter, Louise Wyllie, said it would form a permanent marker of her father#s #out and about# approach to art, which took him across the UK and beyond.She said: #My father used to say that his definition of public art was art the public couldn#t avoid and there are hundreds of sculptures, installations and artworks out there some of which we know about, like the Running Clock in Glasgow, and others which were temporary, such as his most famous artworks, the Straw Locomotive and the Paper Boat.#There are works of my father’s out there – in pubs, houses and gardens – that we don’t know a lot about and it’s important to us that we find out more about them.#We’d like to collate as much information as possible to create the art trail map. The project will act as a window into the past, allowing people to discover my dad’s temporary installations, which were often his most ambitious and influential works.#So we#re asking the public # communities, artists, curators, critics, welders, shipbuilders, school pupils# anyone who worked with my father, who remembers his temporary installations, or knows the whereabouts of public sculpture, to contribute to this project by sharing their stories.#"},{"url":null,"title":"applications open for flexible food fund","story":"By Andrew Galloway, Local Democracy Reporter Updated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There is minimal change to the existing ward boundaries in Helensburgh, while reducing councillor numbers there from seven to six.Ronnie Hinds, commission chairman, said: #Since the consultation began on November , we have received a number of responses offering helpful suggestions.#I#d encourage members of the public, community groups and other bodies to look at the proposals and submit their views, whether they support or oppose our proposals, before the deadline.#The commission is seeking views before final recommendations are submitted to Scottish Ministers.For more information email lgbcs@scottishboundaries.gov.uk or visit the www.lgbc-scotland.gov.uk website."},{"url":null,"title":"coppersmith-george-cairns-releases-cairns-scotch-whisky-liqueur","story":"George Cairns, of East Loan, worked with food technologists at Queen Margaret University in Musselburgh to create Cairns Scotch Whisky Liqueur, which combines blended malt whisky, elderberries and Highland heather honey.George began his career as a coppersmith in  as an apprentice with McMillan, the copper pot still specialist in Prestonpans, making stills and whisky distillery equipment.He progressed to a career in education on the subject, teaching his trade at the University of Edinburgh before working to develop his own drink.He said: ldquoIrsquove always had an interest in whisky all my le, from working in the distilleries, being a consumer, and Irsquove always been involved in some way or another.ldquoIt was an idea that came to me some years ago I spent some years working with the food technologists at Queen Margaret University to develop the method and get the formula just right.His whisky liqueur was ready to sell in February but launch plans were forced to a halt by the coronavirus lockdown.George said: ldquoThe Covid- pandemic impacted on the proposed launch of the product but a soft local launch on social media resulted in steady sales and excellent consumer feedback.George commissioned chocolatier-patissier Sebastian Kobelt to create a limited-edition cranachan truffle to complement the Christmas sales of the whisky liqueur.With hopes it will be on sale in shops early next year, Cairns Scotch Whisky Liqueur can be bought online from www.cairnsscotchwhiskyliqueur"},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-foodbank-boosted-donation-charity-elcap","story":"The money, which would have been used to pay for catering at ELCAPrsquos annual general meeting in October, was made available by the Prestonpans-based social care organisationrsquos Covid-enforced decision to move its AGM online.Paul White, ELCAP chief executive, said: ldquoIn a normal year, wersquod welcome delegates to our AGM with coffees, teas and a bite to eat.ldquoWhile we really missed seeing everyone, we thought wersquod donate the money we saved to a good cause in East Lothian.ldquoRecent research from the Trussell Trust forecast a  per cent rise in demand for food parcels between October and December this year.ldquoWith that in mind, we thought it right to support our local foodbank with a small donation.Candace Higgins, East Lothian Foodbank director, said: ldquoAt East Lothian Foodbank, we do our utmost to provide the best possible food to people restricted by poverty.

But as it got dark the moon came out and Peter saw strange shapes on the hillside. They were moving slightly and he couldnrsquot decide what they were. It seemed they were crawling towards him. It wasnrsquot a wolf but he became very scared.So he blew the horn as hard as he could. He heard the sound of shouting and running feet as his father and other villagers came running up the hill.ldquoWherersquos the wolf  asked Peterrsquos father.ldquoI donrsquot think they are wolves but therersquos something scary over there, he replied.

Irsquom angry and disappointed in you. Do not do that again.He left with the villagers and reminded Peter: ldquoBlow that horn only when there is a wolf.Peter felt angry and disappointed with himself. But now he understood that it was just the outline of the trees and bushes in the moonlight, so he wasnrsquot scared of the shapes anymore.He sat by the fire eating his supper. It was a warm, cosy fire and it made him miss home and his family. His father had always told him that the warmth of a fire was for sharing, but he had no one to share his with. His head began to fill with stories and riddles, but there was no one to share these with either.He wasnrsquot scared anymore but Peter began to feel lonely. He had the sheep but they couldnrsquot solve riddles or listen to stories like his younger siblings, or sit with him by the fire and share its warmth. The fireside was always a place where his father told stories and his mother sang. Now he was alone and sadness overcame him. Hersquod never felt lonely like this.So he picked up the horn and blew it as loud as he could. Once again, the sound of shouting and running feet was heard as Peterrsquos father and his neighbours came running up the hill.ldquoWherersquos the wolf  asked his father.Peter looked down at the ground: ldquoWell, therersquos is no wolf, father, itrsquos just I was so lonely by the fire all by myself and...But he didnrsquot get the chance to explain. ldquoThere is no wolf  said his father angrily. ldquoI can hardly believe you have called us up here once again for nothing!Peter looked down at the ground and apologised, and promised he wouldnrsquot call them for nothing again. His father and the neighbours ed to the village in an unhappy mood.Peter settled down by the fire once again but this time he heard growling and when he looked up there really was a wolf. So he blew the horn as hard as he could. But there was no sound of shouting and running feet. So he blew again. Still nothing.So he shouted ldquowolf, wolf! in between blowing the horn, but his cry of wolf was ignored, because his father and the villagers didnrsquot believe him.The wolf seemed to understand the opportunity and so ate or killed all the sheep.rsquoSo the story ended.

painting scenes from his home town and from Gullane, Dirleton and the Bass Rock, ranging from the castle ruins of the mighty to the humble cottages of the poor.Since he also liked Dunbar, not less than  of his postcards are from this East Lothian coastal town, which was popular among the tourists in Edwardian times.Some of his cards depict standard sights like the Castle Ruins and the Town Hall one has a quaint little cottage at Cleikum Toll and another the Loverrsquos Walk, a rump of which still exists.One of his most interesting cards , from a historical point of view, depicts the ancient Abbey Ruins at Friarscroft: they were quite a rural scene in Edwardian times, with sheep grazing and some old cottages in the background.This Trinitarian abbey was founded by the Countess of Dunbar in , as one of eight known houses to have been located in Scotland.The abbey still stood in  but it fell into a gradual decline the remaining friars moved away, and most of the stoneware of the church was taken away for local building projects.A  map shows that by this time, only the tower stood, being used as a dovecot.In , a group of archaeologists and antiquaries made excavations near the dovecot tower, finding the original tiled floor of the church, but no trace of an original dwelling-house for the friars anywhere nearby.Since the old friars had built their tower sturdy and strong, it still stands today , looking virtually unchanged since Phillimorersquos time.The only sheep to be found anywhere in the vicinity are the lamb chops for sale at the Co-op supermarket, although the cottages in the background remain more or less unchanged.Friarrsquos Walk, also known as the Monkrsquos Walk of Dunbar, is a more mysterious matter.This structure is still largely in existence, consisting of two parallel ancient sandstone rubble walls stretching southwards from West Port.It has been presumed that Friarrsquos Walk must have some connection with the Trinitarian abbey, and that the part connecting it with West Port is a later addition.The northern part of Friars WalkAlready in Victorian times, Friarrsquos Walk was used to dump rubbish and garden refuse from the gardens of the houses on High Street, but the entirewas passable within living memory.When examined by the archaeologists in , it was largely filled with earth and quite overgrown when I explored it in , things had not improved in the slightest.What might have been, through the deployment of a sergeant-major and  unemployed youngsters armed with shovels and saws, one of the leading tourist attractions of Dunbar has been left to fight a losing battle against decay.There does not appear to be any other instances of ancient double walls with a narrow walkway between them, and the Dunbar local historians have speculated what use had been made of Friarrsquos Walk in olden times.One rather adventurous hypothesis is that the Trinitarian monks used the walls as a walkway from their abbey to another building, perhaps their dwelling-house.When ended at its southern extremityby the construction of a Georgian or early Victorian building, Friarrsquos Walk is heading straight for what is today the grounds of the Priory, my own house in Dunbar.No ancient ruins ever existed in these parts, as far as can be discerned: a postcard from Edwardian times, stamped and posted before work on the Priory was begun in , merely shows farmland and market gardens.Maybe the friars had their garden here, growing fruit and medicinal plants Another speculation is that one of the walls of Friarrsquos Walk represents a substantial fragment of the post-medieval western town wall.Since at least the western wall of Friarrsquos Walk has several blocked doorways, a rationalist would instead suspect that it was intended as a rear lane to the houses on High Street, used for the removal of rubbish and garden waste.The mystery of Friarrsquos Walk is a profound one, and unlikely ever to be

discuss the pandemic \"and its impact on the national game at all levels\".A statement on the governing bodys website said: ldquoFollowing a meeting between the Scottish FA and the Minister for Public Health Sport and Wellbeing, both parties have agreed to impose a temporary suspension of all football beneath the Scottish Professional Football League Championship, encompassing all predominantly part-time tiers of the Scottish professional pyramid, from midnight tonight.ldquoThe impacted leagues are: SPFL League One, SPFL League Two, Scottish Womenrsquos Football Premier Leagues   , Highland League, Lowland League, East, West  South of Scotland Leagues, Scottish Junior FA Leagues and the North Caledonian League.Tranent Juniors were the only East Lothian team in action over the weekend as their Scottish Cup adventure came to an end at East Fe.The Belters, who sit top of the EOSFL Premier Division, were due to face Dundonald Bluebell this weekend but no games will now take place until February  at the earliest.Fellow Premier Division sides Musselburgh Athletic and Dunbar United were due to face Sauchie and Crossgates respectively this weekend, while Ormiston were due to welcome Kirkcaldy and Dysart, and Haddington Athletic were facing St Andrews in the First Division Conference A.Preston Athletic were not scheduled to have a game this weekend.However, those games will all now need to be rescheduled.Rod Petrie, Scottish FA president, said: ldquoThe Scottish FA is well aware of the efforts all clubs take to comply with the exacting protocols that were conditional on elite football being given an exemption to continue amid the pandemic.ldquoNonetheless, the continuation of football at all levels has weighed increasingly heavy on me as president, my colleagues on the board and the joint response group as we have watched the new strain of the virus spread rapidly.ldquoWhile national sport has been afforded the privilege of elite sporting exemption, the risk of mass transportation of untested, largely part-time players is something that cannot be sustained as the cases continue to rise and available hospital beds become increasingly scarce.ldquoAfter discussions with the SPFL, the Premiership and Championship will continue on the proviso that both adhere to the existing testing regime.ldquoThe vast majority of teams in those isions are full-time professional clubs and so the risk of transmission remains manageably low.ldquoThe cost implications to lower-ision clubs was one factor but so too the realisation that many ndash with some notable exceptions ndash consist of part-time players who are either prevented from working due to the virus or have to work.ldquoIn either case, the risk is currently too great amid the developing nationwide

new move could spark a similar response in Scotland and comes as four people were arrested after protesters clashed with police at an anti-lockdown demonstration.A small crowd gathered at Holyrood at around pm on Monday to take part in the Scotland Against Lockdown event.Community liaison officers warned those who were in attendance that they would face a finethey stay at the location, however

study had shown that up to  houses could be occupied before any work was needed to improve the major access routes.Concern about the impact of the new town, which will be accessed off the Bankton interchange on the A, has been raised repeatedly by concerned members of the local community as the project progresses.But at a virtual meeting of the councilrsquos planning committee this week, the change to the condition was approved, after elected members ruled that the need to see houses on the ground at the settlement took priority.Despite some misgivings about the study, which insisted the traffic created by the first  homes being occupied would have a minimal impact on current movement, councillors backed the move.Councillor Kenny McLeod told the committee: ldquoNow is the time to get the foot down on this [project] and get it moving.The first residents of Blindwells, which will eventually see an initial population of ,, are expected to move in this September.East Lothian planners initially approved the building of the first phase of houses with a condition which required upgrades to the Bankton interchange, including traffic control signals at the roundabouts and additional upgrades to the slip roads.However, the amendment will now allow  homes to be occupied before any of the upgrade work is carried out.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader, told the planning committee that Blindwells was ldquoone of the most important developments in our local plan.He said: ldquoIt is important this site moves forward, it has been so long in the waiting.ldquoIt is also important not to impose conditions on applicants that are onerous and can prevent it going forward.Some elected members voiced disappointment that no representative of Hargreaves took part in the

WARNING: This picture must only be used to accompany PA Feature GARDENING Advice Photo.World renowned garden photographer Richard Bloom , one of the competition judges, offers the following tips on how to get the best out of the outdoor world on camera. After all, nature photography is one of the more socially distant and safe pastimes in the current climate...Find the lightThe best light for garden photography is early morning or evening on a sunny day, ideally within the first hour of sunrise or last before sunset, when the sun is low and the light is soft and golden.Aim from the sideCompose the scene with the light coming into it from the side or backlit rather than straight on. This will help to create mood, contrast and depth to the image.Shoot for diagonalsIncluding diagonals creates both depth and drama. If a garden has a path or stream running through it, find an angle where these elements are arranged diagonally so the eye travels through the image from foreground to background.Consider unusual perspectivesPhotograph from low down or from high up. Plant portraits and close ups are often best from a low angle, depending on the plant.Capture coloursThe best conditions for recording colour in the garden is when its cloudy or early or late in the day, as colours appear more saturated when the light is dfused.Take inspiration from previous winnersLast years Overall Young Winner Elliot Connor, scooped first prize with his dramatic snapshot of a perching bush cricket in Australias Garigal National Park.Offering words of wisdom for this years entrants, Connor says: \"Entering a photography competition of this calibre can seem like a leap of faith, but its well worth the effort. The best pictures, I feel, are those that change our perspective.\"Look for new angles, get creative with shadows or silhouettes, be choosy about your backgrounds and bold in the execution. I hope that this years competition goes even further in lightening Covids load, as a celebration of the great outdoors.\"Photographers of all levels are invited to submit their work across  distinct categories, including Indoor Gardening, Welcoming Wildle and Plants.For ambitious photographers, the unique Portfolio category requires a collection of at least six images united by a common theme or style, with the opportunity to be awarded a prestigious RHS Medal.Entry to the RHS Photographic Competition is free and open to everyone, and images can be taken on any photographic device. Entries should be submitted online at rhs.org.uk photocomp by am on Monday, February , .

Within The Ark there are Levels, rising to Level Four for the truly blessed and descending five miles down into the ldquoLowers. Citizens sleep in pods which steer and control their dreams. All light is articial.Of course The Ark is a glittering lie. The Levels are split into Zones and in the lowest is the Poor Quarter, whose denizens undertake menial jobs and whose hardscrabble lives are plagued by crime and the authoritarian brutality of the Ersquolul Corporation.Our protagonist is Markriss Denny, or Mark, or Mars or Riss, depending on which of several alternative version of his le wersquore wading through at the time. We first meet him as a child living in the Outer City, mourning the death of his brother and hanging out with his friend, Nesta. He moves to The Ark and becomes a journalist, at least for the first  pages. In the second of the three acts, Markriss, Nesta and Markrissrsquos we Chileshe are now members of The Outsiders, a group of political activists plotting to take on the Ersquolul Corporation.Markriss is subject to visions. At times he leaves his body and moves into an astral plane where he communes with the spirit of Professor Harman Wallace, inventor of the pods. There is much talk of ethereal bodies and of chakras. At one point Markriss lies with ldquoevery hair rising to attention, the subtle atoms formerly at rest above his mortal body awakened, chakras spinning, primed to make a superfluity of connections. So is act one a hallucinatory vision  Does act two take place in an alternate reality, with an alternate Markriss  Is Wallace trickster or guide Act three, the most coherent, takes us to modern-day London where Markriss is writing about his own day-to-day le, real-le events such as the  General Election and also making notes for a long-standing project about The Ark. It ties things together up to a point, though it isnrsquot long before wersquore flipped back into the world of Geb and a coda whichus to the le of Markriss .Class, race, dferent iterations of self, the power of the imagination, Afrofuturism, politics, spirituality, physics and philosophy ndash itrsquos all here in a high-concept novel blending sci-fi and speculative fiction with the self-critique of memoir, though unravelling it confidently on a single read-through of the -plus pages is quite an undertaking."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12207168.jpg?type=article-full","title":"five-arts-venues-cant-wait-revisit-lockdown","story":"The absence of live entertainment has hit hard.

Her horns hidden in a tumult of hair, she walks along Constitution Street towards a city that is dark and unheimlich a city populated by beggars, glowering gargoyles and men of the cloth who swoop down the High Street like crows. The year is , but it is an Edinburgh Kidnappedrsquos David Balfour would instantly recognise: a place of hubbub, and of tenements, both multi-storeyed and multi-storied, ldquostanding sentinel around the Tron.In recent years, Edinburgh has plied a trade as a backdrop for the crime novels of Ian Rankin and others. But Fagan plays up the cityrsquos Gothic traits to produce an instant classic. Suffused with dread, Luckenbooth is a perverse love song to its castle and its catacombs its plague victims and its Presbyterianism its hedonism and its haar.The ghost of Robert Louis Stevenson stalks its narrative wynds. Deacon Brodie ndash respectable cabinet maker by day housebreaker by night ndash is the inspiration for Luckenboothrsquos villain Mr Udnam just as he was for Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Fagan acknowledges the debt. She has Flora ndash a trans woman at a sex party ndash remind us that Stevensonrsquos most famous novel was written during a six-day cocaine binge. And Luckenbooth possesses that same frenetic energy the same fever-dream quality found in her debut, The Panoptican, about a teenage girl in care. It is asall the images in Faganrsquos head are engaged in a breathless, deathless race on to the page. References to Hitler, druids, pagans and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse snap at each otherrsquos heels. Witches and assassins, madams and mediums jostle for their place in a universe which, while anchored in a familiar geographical literary landscape, moves to its own wild beat.The Luckenbooth of the title ndash No  Luckenbooth to be precise ndash is a nine-storey building in the heart of the Old Town. It is named after the lockable booths for traders ndash luckenbuiths ndash which stood nearby, but a luckenbooth is also a silver brooch sometimes worn to ward off witches. This is ironic because the tenement is cursed. Jessie has been sold as a surrogate mother to wealthy landlord Mr Udnamrsquos baby. The atrocity that follows works its way into the fabric of the building, rising like damp through its floors, infecting its eccentric residents over the course of almost  years.Faganrsquos conjuring of the tenement is an incredible feat. She creates a literary Windows in the West, providing fleeting glimpses of self-contained worlds: a man at his piano a parrot flying round a room. But more than that, she captures the ebb and flow of humanity, the way we weave in and out of each othersrsquo lives, barely touching.There are the daily routines: ldquoA kettle whistle goes on a stove on the fourth floor each day at am, am, pm and then again at pm, Levi, a black American, who works in the Royal Dick veterinary building, writes to his brother in . But there is also a fluidity, an overlapping of existence the living moving in tandem with the dead. Leitmots create connections. Jessie has a cage around her heart made of ldquobone, bone, bone, Levi sorts animal bones ldquonumerically by size and species, and the tenement has access to the vaults where body-snatchers Burke and Hare once wheeled their victimsrsquo bodies.Like all great Gothic works, Luckenbooth deals in duality: good evil, light dark. The more sins Mr Udman commits, the more philanthropic he becomes. Jessie has her fatherrsquos horns, but stands up against the landlord. Flora has changed from male to female, but is still caught in a biological trap. Copious mind-altering drugs are consumed and sex is had in an impressive range of numerical gender combinations.This duality extends to the setting. Fagan builds on the idea of there being two Edinburghs, ldquoone above ground and one below, one in the centre and one on the outskirts. This duality can be thrilling. ldquoSometimes the sky races in such a way it seems there are two skies from two dferent worlds entirely ndash rushing at each other in opposite directions, layers of cloud and dark moodiness, Levi writes.The lust extends to the setting, too. Fagan comes at Edinburgh like a voracious lover, eager to explore both its conspicuous beauty and its secret places. She runs the gamut of its sinister hotspots: Greyfriars Kirkyard, the execution site on the Grassmarket, the notorious Pubic Triangle. But that is not enough. She wants us to see the city from every angle, in every light, so she sends Flora up the Salisbury Crags. At sunset ldquothey look like they are on fire, Flora says. ldquoThe entire thing turns rose gold.From the top she can see the ldquowhole city skyline sparkle before her. Just as in The Sunlight Pilgrims ndash which features a frozen dystopian near-future in the Highlands ndash Faganrsquos writing sparkles most when she is describing landscape. But she also crams Luckenbooth full of legends. She tells of Robert the Brucersquos heart, cut out so it could be taken to the Holy Land, and of Baska Murmanska, the polar bear mascot of a First World War Polish battalion, led through Leith by war-weary soldiers. Now and then, she tries too hard, and the stories begin to stack up like supermarket BOGOFs but mostly her vivid descriptions keep everything fresh.Luckenbooth is a horror story, originally and beautully told. But it is also a paean to the city Hugh MacDiarmid described as a ldquomad Godrsquos dream. This quote is the bookrsquos epigraph, and Fagan serves it well. Indeed, so fully has she fleshed out MacDiarmidrsquos vision, she may have ruined Edinburgh as a location for Gothic novelists for many years to come."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12207447.jpg?type=article-full","title":"gavin-francis-gp-coronavirus","story":"To be a GP at the start of the st century was not so very dferent from being a GP in the s or s. ldquoThere was a kind of timeless feeling about the nature of the work, he tells me.And then this time last year everything began to change.Sunday morning. January . It is the day before the latest lockdown is announced and Francis is thinking about our lives under the shadow of the coronavirus about how his le and work has changed in the last  months and how everyone rsquos has too.Francis who is both a GP and an author has written Intensive Care, a book about what it was like to be a doctor in the first few months of a pandemic.In the past he has written about his love of islands , his time spent in Antarcticaand about medicine and human change inthe award-winning Shapeshters. ldquoI make sense of the world through writing about it, he explains.In Intensive Care he charts his experiences in , in both an inner-city GPrsquos practice in Edinburgh and his short time spent as a doctor up on Orkney.The result, as he writes in the introduction, is an attempt at ldquoan eyewitness account of the most intense months I have known in my -year career.Define intense, Gavin  ldquoI was trying to keep my clinic going because Irsquom a GP partner with key colleagues in an inner-city practice. I was trying to manage the home-schooling of my children. I was managing a huge amount of uncertainty and stress among my patients, among my staff and my colleagues.ldquoAnd then, when I actually was seeing covid patients, the kind of measures we had to take were extraordinarily dficult to get used to the layers, the barriers, theof time it took to get all the PPE on and getall off again safely.ldquoIt just put huge pressure on the simple business of medicine, which is to see people in distress and attempt to ease their suffering. It was phenomenally complicated by the measures that we had to take. I suppose thatrsquos what I mean by intense, because everything was just laden with this stress and with this drama brought by the virus.Clearly, things are not getting better. We are entering this new year with coronavirus cases surging. Francis, like he has been for the last  months, is on the front line.ldquoItrsquos very, very dficult. Where Irsquom working in Edinburgh the hospitals arenrsquot full yet, like the scenes we are seeing in the south-east of England, but they are filling up.ldquoTherersquos a winter beds crisis every year, but this year is so much worse because wersquove got this terrible new respiratory virus to deal with on top of everything .There are a few small upsides, he says. There has been a lot less flu around this winter than normal as a result of all our social distancing. Still, last week he got an email from NHS Lothian asking him and his colleague to do everything within their power to try and prevent admitting patients to hospital.Read More: Grief in a time of pandemicThatrsquos an annual request, he says. However, he adds, ldquoWersquore having to contemplate shutting down routine care yet again. Wersquore becoming a national covid service at the moment.To think back to last January and February now is to recall another world. We lived in a pre-pandemic world and it took us all a while to realise how much was changing. As a GP, Francis and his colleagues had to completely rethink how to deliver care, how to organise their daily practice of medicine. It was a tricky transition.ldquoWe were forced into trying to manage things on the phone because we had no option. Ordinarily my training would tell me you should always see people face to face.Francis had a front-seat view of the spread of the virus. In the book he points out that that last February and March he was very quickly aware of how rapidly the virus was spreading, more rapidly than the government, health boards and the chief medical officer seemed to be acknowledging at the time.ldquoI would hear stories that made me conscious of just how widespread the virus was in the city, Francis recalls. ldquoI was working up in Orkney in February before it had really hit and then, by the time we were into March, it was definitely spreading quite quickly when I was back in my usual practice.ldquoThe government knew that, but I think this was such an unprecedented, explosive situation in terms of controlling the infection that at every stage it feels like the government couldnrsquot quite believe that they were going to have to go to these extremes.ldquoThey couldnrsquot quite believe that they were going to have to close down all the hotels, that they were going to have to shut down flights in and out of the city. At every stage, when it proved we had to do these things, there was an understandable and justiable reluctance to go that extra step, which subsequently proved necessary.ldquoAnd thatrsquos why I think every single Western country has struggled with this virus. The ones that have done pretty well with it in the Far East have got populations that are willing to tolerate a far greater level of state intrusion into their lives.ldquoCountries like the UK are not used to accepting that the state can just lock us up in our own houses for  days.ldquoWersquore not used to having to hand over our personal details every time we visit a pub or a restaurant. Wersquore just not used to that level of state intrusion.Intensive Care is a cool, thoughtful book, and not one, it should be said, particularly interested in blame. ldquoNo, not at all. Itrsquos very easy to look back retrospectively. At every stage I was quite incredulous too. lsquoAre they are really going to have to close all the schools  Are they really going to have to ban flights rsquoWhat he hopes is,this happens again, we will be quicker to close borders and quicker to ramp up mass testing.ldquoGoing forward from this pandemic I think government will be a lot better at keeping pandemic stocks of PPE up to date. Ours had all started to go out of date because they had been stockpiled for the swine flu of .ldquoWe did have access to masks, aprons and so on. We didnrsquot have gowns and the WHO were advising people to wear full gowns.One of the most striking revelations in Intensive Care is how quickly Francis and his colleagues were dealing with a surge in mental health problems as lockdown began. ldquoOne day,  March, almost everything I dealt with related to mental health, he writes.Thatrsquos just two days after Boris Johnson announced a lockdown, I say.ldquoIt was happening so fast, partly because I am in in the city centre of Edinburgh and so much of the economy of that part of Scotland is devoted to tourism. Therersquos a lot of guesthouses there, a lot of people who depend on tourists. And suddenly that was all blown away.ldquoSo, I was seeing the effects of people not just coming to terms with a very dangerous, le-threatening pandemic infection, but also the collapse of their businesses, especially at that time when it wasnrsquot clear what the economic support measures would be. There was a real sense of terror among people who were furloughed or even under threat of redundancy. The uncertainty of that, combined with being ordered to stay home on the pain of essentially risking your le.The impact on our mental health led Francis to join a number of doctors and nurses in writing a letter to education secretary John Swinney to try to get children back into schools.ldquoYou could see the government was doing everything it could to avoid a measurable harm, which was covid deaths among adults because that is a statistic that would be on the front of every newspaper. A terrying statistic. But there were innumerable, less measurable harms still being perpetrated.ldquoI donrsquot envy the politicians making these choices, but, essentially, because the deaths were measurable, everything was done to mitigate that. But there were enormous harms being done by keeping the kids off school, by enforcing everybody to stay home, by the shutdown of massive sectors of the economy. Thatrsquos before we get on to the enormous harm done to the elderly people told to shield and to be away from anybody, to not see their grandchildren for month after month after month. And Irsquom seeing real outcomes of that now, after almost a year of this.ldquoPeople in their late eighties and nineties are saying, lsquoYou know, I might not have many years left and to avoid seeing the people who make my le most worthwhile for so long has been truly terrible, truly dficult.rsquoThe impact on our mental health can also be seen in the rise this last  months of cases of self-harm, panic attacks, and psychosis ndash all, Francis says, on the rise in his own practice.Itrsquos a reminder, I suggest, that being human is about contact and without it we are damaged.ldquoAbsolutely and one of the cruellest aspects of this virus is it spreads through touch and through voice. Singing was one of the worst ways of spreading the virus. Wersquore told to mask up to not touch each other. Itrsquos kind of like an attack on the most basic elements of our humanity.Wersquore being urged to resume clapping for our ldquoheroes again. Francis quite enjoyed the clapping that accompanied the early weeks of the lockdown. Not all of his colleagues felt the same, though.ldquoSome of them hated it. I didnrsquot so much like the clapping, but I really liked the opportunity to chat with my neighbours. If I happened to be home on a Thursday evening and all the neighbours were out on the street, it was quite nice to see each other, four metres apart.ldquoAnd itrsquos interesting how much that amazing upwelling of good feeling towards key workers at that time has kind of dissolved now.Well, indeed. He talks about the scenes of covid-deniers gathering outside hospitals in England with utter incomprehension.ldquoWhat can we do to assure people it is absolutely not a hoax  People are dying of this and the ones that arenrsquot dying of it are very ill, sometimes for a long time. Irsquom not sure how  you can convince people. Itrsquos quite extraordinary to me that people can even deny it exists.Does that make you angry  ldquoNot so much angry. Irsquom absolutely mystied.What the pandemic has reminded us, Francis suggests, is that we are vulnerable. But also, of human ingenuity. ldquoThe ability to create several al vaccines within a few months of this emerging is tremendous, he says.ldquoOn the other hand, itrsquos quite startling to think we havenrsquot progressed in terms of how we best manage and control this kind of viral outbreak. I found that depressing in many ways. In some ways we havenrsquot moved on, for all our sophistication.And so here we are in January , somewhere between hope and fear. Francis leans towards the former. ldquoYeah, Irsquom really hopeful. Irsquom optimistic because we have two vaccines approved for use. Irsquove already had my first vaccination. Irsquom getting my booster later this week. Wersquore vaccinating care homes just now. Wersquore going to vaccinate the over-s very shortly.ldquoThat is the only way wersquore going to get out of this. Wersquore going to get herd immunity through vaccination rather than herd immunity through people having caught and recovered from it.ldquoOf course, it could have been better. Of course, I could point to things that have gone wrong over the last year. Now what wersquove got to do is stick with the measures and vaccinate, vaccinate, to get out of it.Gavin Francis is a GP.

It is claimed that the cost of Erasmus was too high and that more students from lower socio-economic backgrounds will now study at the worldrsquos leading universities. Any proper cost-benefit-analysis, however, must include the huge income to businesses in university areas, and to the wider economy, that is generated by students and visiting friends and family.Students in Scotland account for  per cent of UK outbound mobility. Londonrsquos disregard for Scotlandrsquos situation may do further damage to the Union, particularly as students in Northern Ireland will continue to benefit from Erasmus.Misconceptions must be challenged. Erasmus is not restricted to the wealthy. More than  per cent of law undergraduates at Glasgow University, and half of those from under-represented socio-economic groups, participate. Nor is it a holiday the grades achieved abroad are counted towards their final degree. Erasmus is a long-established exchange programme involving fee-waiver and financial support for students. It funds incoming students to Scotland and outgoing students . Reciprocity requires funding in both directions, as Switzerland recognised when itwithdrew from Erasmus. Without reciprocity there is no exchange and without exchange study abroad is a radically dferent, more expensive, and more exclusive proposition.European students can study in English in most member states. If not funded to study in Britain, they will go where, particularly given the post-Brexit pound charge Britain will now impose for a visa and healthcare. Only those who can afford to will come to Britain. This will decrease social mobility as the opportunity for British students seeking to study in more affordable destinations in central Europe will be lost because few,any, students will come the other way.While Turing presumes that non-European institutions will agree mutual fee-waivers, the tradition of mobility exchange is not replicated outside Europe. Glasgow law school is ranked th globally, but non-European agreements have lapsed as partners found exchange reciprocity impossible. Most UK universities will find it costly and near-impossible to negotiate fee-waivers, particularly as Turing will be out-classed by a competing Erasmus scheme now itself global.The \"truly global\" promise also misleads, for Government prioritisation will determine destinations and students will be sent to countries targeted for strengthened economic and social relationships. Student mobility is now an aspect of strategic policy-delivery rather than education.The new programme was met with despair. Decades of increasing internationalisation in learning and \"spin-off\"benefits in research and postgraduate recruitment are threatened. Longstanding subject-area links supporting student confidence in undertaking mobility will be abandoned. An important education, cultural and personal experience will be denied thousands of students from all backgrounds.

Sadly, they have been a particular feature of my experience in politics. Usually, they come from a position of ignorance from those who have never spoken with me and wish to distort something Irsquove said by taking it wholly out of context. I am afraid Mr Smithrsquos column yesterday was typical.It is clear that Mr Smith had not read properly or,he did, had not understood the original article written by me from which he selectively quoted. First, I explained that the ideal method for Scotland to become independent would be after a referendum based on an agreement between the British and Scottish governments as set out previously in the Edinburgh Agreement. Secondly, in the context of exploring whether there might be other legal and constitutional options, amongst other points I identied that there is historical precedent for a country exiting its union with England by a process of treaty negotiation after a majority of pro-independence MPs win an election. That is what happened when Ireland and England entered into the Anglo-Irish treaty in . As might be expected given the subject matter, I went out of my way to stress that no one would want to replicate the violence which intervened and that my reference was to the legal and constitutional precedent.It is of note that the , a newspaper which one might expect to be well acquainted with the matter, reported what I said accurately and without hyperbole or hysteria. I would respectfully suggest that Mr Smith might do well to aspire to their standard of journalism and commentary.If we canrsquot have broader intellectual discussion of political ideas without this sort of ill-informed backlash itrsquos not a good thing for Scottish public debate nor indeed for freedom of speech, of which I know your newspaper is a proud proponent.I set out in further depth some of the legal and constitutional options open to Scotland in my recent keynote address to the Cardf Centre for Governance which can be viewed in full at https:www.youtube watch vxzCGxLPQwU.There is much that is wrong with Mr Smithrsquos column in fact and tone, but my main objection is that in saying that there is a necessity to talk about me he has not taken the slightest trouble ever to speak with me or to properly acquaint himself with my background.Had he done so he would know that I am an Irish as well as a British citizen and as such well acquainted with my countryrsquos history. As the daughter of an Irish woman and of a historian, I was brought up to know and understand the history of Ireland, Scotland and indeed Britain. Accordingly, I donrsquot need an Irish history lesson from Mr Smith nor indeed a lecture on what parallels might or might not be drawn with Scotland.Mr Smith sought to accuse me of ignorance and distortion but that is in fact a charge that is more fairly laid against him for failing to inform himself of the subject about which he chose to write.I donrsquot expect an apology, but Irsquom pleased to put my position on the record.Joanna Cherry QC MP.A DEMOCRATIC AND PEACEFUL ROUTEMARK Smithrsquos article included Irish independence and is a topic well beyond the scope of single articles or letters and writers thereof have no choice other than to be selective. Mr Smith does this by discussing the violence which preceded the years running up to the  Irish election but not the causes of the violence and calls Joanna Cherry irresponsible for citing the Irish election of  as a route for Scottish independence, a sort of Plan B.Whilst acknowledging the violence, Ms Cherry was unwise to use Ireland as a comparator, and caution has to be exercised when discussing Irelandrsquos complex political history. Anyone with the most elementary knowledge of the background to Irelandrsquos independence cannot disassociate the accompanying violence. I do believe Ms Cherry was attempting to illustrate there is precedent for an alternative democratic method other than a referendum for voters to make their wishes known on Scottish independence. Absolutely no one can castigate the SNP leadership for seeking other than a democratic and peaceful route to Scottish independence.Irish unrest went back centuries but a major catalyst, among others at dferent periods of time, was the Famine or Irish Potato Famine starting in resulting in mass starvation with more than one million people dying and many emigrating and the population of Ireland falling by more than % in the period. Good crops continued to be exported across the Irish Sea and the plight caused in Ireland by the famine was largely ignored by Westminster despite many entreaties, until such time as the number of deaths meant it could be neglected no longer. The solutions to Irish problems continued to be ignored by Westminster and played no small part in the early th century history of Ireland.What then are the ways to Scottish independencethere is a clear democratic and sustained majority vote by the people toto being a sovereign country once again Alan M Morris, Blanefield.WE NEED A VELVET DIVORCEldquoA NATIONALIST view of history writes Mark Smith, but it is his nationalist perspective that seems blind. Irish home rule bills were repeatedly vetoed by what Lord Roseberry called ldquothe majority vote of English MPs. This denial of peaceful change, led, eventually, to the collapse of the parliamentary nationalist home rule parties in Ireland to be replaced by Irish Republican Sinn Fein seeking independence. There was violence, many people died in fighting between British forces against Irish, and Irish against Irish. You could argue the Irish civil war only ended with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in .Mr Smith argues Joanna Cherry is wrong to argue against another route for Scottish independence other than a -style referendum. Independence without a referendum worked for Czechoslovakia it looks highly unlikely that any referendum bill for Scotland could get through the Westminster Parliament, never mind any subsequent independence bill, and a Velvet Divorce would avoid much the unpleasantness that is already evident in the metropolitan commentariat.If unionists had expended as much energy finding a solution to Irelands desire for home rule, independence might never have happened. You could argue exactly the same in Scotland since Keir Hardie argued for dominion status for Scotland, but England seems to want us gone, as much as we want to go.GR Weir, Ochiltree.WHY NOT ACCEPT  RESULT I HAD to smile just a little at the irony of Kevin Orrs letterregarding Jill Stephensons letter of January  on Mays elections. He said: \"Ms Stevenson is living in a country that still has a democratic process and she will therefore have to accept the result of that election\". As Mr Orr is clearly of the SNP independence position, did he and his fellow travellers accept the result of the  election  Of course they didnt, despite the overwhelming result ndash  per cent to % ndash against independence.I know that Ms Sturgeon has been presenting herself very well on TV day after day as a more concise leader of her country during this Covid pandemic . However, as a country with the embarrassing record of being sixth-worst for deaths in the world, an education system on the point of collapse, a health service which cannot cope, local government desperate for some of the millions of pounds which the Scottish Government has kept from it, failed policies such as the Named Person and football bigotry policies, why would anyone want to praise Ms Sturgeons Government  And thats before we even consider the road that independence would take us down. Have we not learned from that other nationalist action ndash Brexit, and the damage that it has done to all the UK Councillor Eileen McCartin , Paisley.THE DEMOCRATIC DEFICITMAY I improve on Mrs Freddie Dales statisticsby adding a couple more  Seventy-five per cent of Scottish voters did not vote Tory and yet we have a Tory Government in the UK, and % of Scottish voters voted Remain and yet Scotland is out of the EU.This is known as the democratic deficit and to continue to support it, as Mrs Dale seems to, is fundamentally anti-democratic. I hope that she will eventually come round to a better understanding of democracy.John Jamieson, Ayr.Read more: Independence: Joanna Cherry: A nationalist view of history that raises a worrying vision of the future"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-nicola-sturgeon-likely-extend-lockdown","story":"The First Minister discussed potential additional measures with her Cabinet on Tuesday morning over ldquowhether there are any areas ndash takeaway, click and collect services being two examples ndash where we think there is a need to further tighten restrictions to reduce the occasions and reasons for people to be out of their homes.Ms Sturgeon said that discussions will continue and any changes will be announcedwhen she addresses Holyrood tomorrow.She added: ldquoIt may not be about saying you cannot have takeaway at all, but do we need to tighten up how that operates just to limit the potential for people coming together inside.Click and collect may not be stopped ldquoaltogether, she said, but it was being consideredit should remain for non-essential services.:Covid Scotland: Coronavirus deaths rise by Hospital admissions continue to be at a very high level with , people in hospital in the latest daily figures.The First Minister said: ldquoThat compares to a peak of just over , in the first wave back in April - so again we can see the very acute pressure that Covid is currently putting on our hospitals across the country.Ms Sturgeon pointed to the test positivity not rising to around  per cent in Scotland, as it has done in parts of England ndash and is instead around the  per cent mark, amid suggestion things may be stabilising, albeit at a very high level.She added: ldquoI donrsquot want anybody getting complacent around that because itrsquos too early to be definitive.\"If it is the case that the restrictions might be starting to stabilise things, itrsquos only because wersquove got the restrictions and we need to keep at them to keep it like that and avoid it running amok again.ldquoBecause wersquove still got that high level, wersquore going to see continued and growing pressure on the NHS for some time to come, which is why it is so important to keep it under control.:Councils call for extra pound.bn and no cap on council taxNext week, ministers will review the current lockdown restrictions and decide whether it will be extended into next monthndash with all of mainland Scotland under lsquostay at homersquo orders and islands under level  measures, while schools are closed across the entire country until at least February .The First Minister warned that it is unlikely the rules will be eased signicantly,at all, following the review.She said: ldquoI wouldnrsquot want to raise expectations that we will lt all of these restrictions at the end of January ndash I think that is very unlikely that we will have a wholesale lting of these restrictions.ldquoThere may not even be any of these restrictions as soon as the end of January.

One of the biggest political issues of this decade will be how to reform the internet without destroying freedom of speech. How to turn the digital enfant terrible into what internet evangelists envisaged at the birth of web: a means of bringing people together by promoting universal knowledge and understanding.So how did that dream fail so disastrously  Instead of enlightenment we have rampant conspiracy and abuse in place of tolerance we have isive identity politics instead of a civilised public square, hyper-partisan mobs parading their self-righteousness and seeking heresies to condemn. It canrsquot go on.Section rsquos words seemed innocuous: ldquoNo provider or user of an interactive computer service, it ruled ldquoshall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider. Those words destroyed the carefully curated and regulated media universe occupied by newspapers, broadcasting and the publishing industry.

And it was President Bill Clintonrsquos law that signed their death warrant.:Neil Mackay: Wersquore all weak, fallible humans. That is why I oppose the death penaltySection  gave Facebook, Google and Twitter licence that no newspaper enjoys. If The Herald incited violence, or allowed people to incite violence on its pages, it would be held liable. This is because the publisher of content is regarded as equally responsible for what is published. And a great burden it is too. This article, and every comment posted under it, has to be moderated and subjected to rigorous standards of accuracy before it can be published. Itrsquos an expensive and time-consuming business. It is called editing.There are no editors on Twitter, or the other internet sites. They moderate only after the event,at all. Thus Facebook, Google and Twitter, in reality the biggest publishers on the planet, are not regarded as publishers at all. This even though they are disseminating massive volumes of content ndash much of it plagiarised from the conventional media ndash and earning countless billions in advertising revenues.The fiction that was perpetrated by Section  ndash at the behest of the tech entrepreneurs ndash was that Twitter and Facebook are not publications but ldquoneutral s. Their owners said they should be treated like telecoms companies. You wouldnrsquot expect BT to be responsible for what people say on the telephone, they snorted. Yet private phone conversations are not broadcast to millions, nor can thousands of angry keyboard warriors pile in and abuse you in mid-sentence.This bogus equivalence is patently ridiculous now that Twitter is effectively editing the President of the United States by banning him. Yet the truth is that these companies have from the start been curating and editing their content, only they do it mostly with pernicious algorithms. Twitter, Facebook and YouTube preselect your feed by recommendation software that offers up more of what it thinks you want to read. Over time you are exposed to more and more extreme versions of your own views while alternative views are filtered out.:Independence: Time for the left in Scotland to get organisedThis filter bubble is the basis of the social media business model. They discovered early on that the way to promote traffic, and money, is to promote ision, confrontation and abuse, to foster anger and hatred. That is why Twitter allows people to post anonymously ndash a blatant invitation to abuse. Inevitably, anyone with a public profile ndash like Meghan Markle or JK Rowling ndash becomes a target for anonymous bedroom sociopaths who derive excitement from abusing women.As anyone who posts regularly on Twitter soon discovers, the only way to prevent being bullied by legions of angry keyboard warriors is to cultivate your own team. Itrsquos a defence mechanism. But to keep your team onside, you have to keep reinforcing their narrow political line and you rapidly become a captive. I watched in amazement during Brexit as normally balanced journalists and academics became raging bulls of Brexit or Remain.Only around three per cent of the population regularly tweet, so this is an entirely self-selecting and unrepresentative sample of voters. Yet politicians and many journalists have become obsessed by Twitter. Our politics has increasingly taken on its contrarian style: cancel culture, misrepresentation, guilt by association ... and when that doesnrsquot work, defamation and death threats. Politicians must stop regarding Twitter as a guide to public attitudes. At best it is an echo chamber.Many journalists, myself included, were caught up in filter bubbles through promoting our work. We may think that having , followers, as I acquired, is something to be proud of, a validation. In fact it is a cage from which it is very dficult to escape. As soon as you start being objective, saying things that deviate from their political line, these followers turn in an instant into a raging mob.As the German President Angela Merkel has warned, a handful of tech billionaires are now being allowed to determine who should be heard on these s, a role for which they are manestly unfit. Big Tech should be broken up to create ersity and allow for democratic regulation.

Tech barons must be held accountable for perverting public discourse.Having created a monster in Donald Trump the internet behemoths are belatedly trying to slam the stable door.

He claried that his basic message to students remains that they should notto their term-time accommodation until in-person teaching resumes, as advised by their institution.Mr Lochhead said: “These changes reflect the current status of the virus, the reality of the new strain, and the rise in cases in recent weeks.“Theof students to campus, including ing to term-time accommodation, involves the mass movement of thousands of people across the country. The mixing of people on that scale, including the potential movement of tens of thousands of students to university halls and private-rented flats, simply isn’t safe right now. It would fuel the virus, and that is something no one wants.“Our immediate priority right now is to say to students, other than in specic special circumstances, they must notto their campus or term-time accommodation before they are specically told to do so by their institution.“For the overwhelming majority of university students, this means all learning will be online-only at least for January and February, and students should not expect toto campus or student accommodation before the end of February.“We will review plans in light of the state of the pandemic nearer the time, but right now even the very limited number of s that were previously planned for phase two of the restart dates, cannot happen until at least the middle of next month for the majority of students, supported by rapid-result testing on arrival.“We would like to thank everyone for their patience and fortitude in dealing with the pandemic over past months, and we understand this is more dficult news – but we want to give students and staff as much certainty as we can so they can plan effectively. That’s why we are setting this plan out now.“As we have all seen, this virus moves fast and changes quickly but even in light of that reality, hopefully by setting out a clear plan that gives certainly for at least the next two months, everyone can now plan with a greater degree of confidence.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Among the deserving recipients are leading lights who have battled to save lives and keep the NHS afloat and those who have kept the country smiling by spreading kindness.The list includes medical experts as well as volunteers working with youngsters, the elderly and those with disabilities. Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.” vw, px\"  Jacquie Winning’s award “recognises the achievements of everyone” at Forth Valley Sensory Centre following “an exceptionally challenging year”.The  year-old from Falkirk was recognised for going the extra mile to manage “wraparound” services to people with sensory loss during the pandemic “COVID- has been challenging for everyone, but more so for people with sensory loss. Those with hearing loss face challenges due to face masks and social distancing interfering with their ability to lip read.“Those with sight loss face signicant challenges managing to maintain physical distancing while undertaking essential trips out,” explained the MBE recipient.Jacquie’s support included providing Braille copies of virus information, establishing telephone, text and email befriending lelines to address isolation and producing podcasts providing vital updates.“The impact is that some of the most vulnerable people in society have been incredibly well supported during the most challenging of times.

Once I was allowed to talk about it, the first thing I said was how fortunate I was to work with this team. “ was dficult professionally. Personally, I had many successes.

Then I saw it was from the Cabinet Office. “For me, it’s about the efforts of other people as well.“So many people have been very supportive over the years.

They said current plans would leave London and other major cities ldquowith fewer vaccines per head of population compared to less densely populated regions. vw,vw,px, px\"London Councils chair Georgia Gould has teamed with London Mayor Sadiq Khan to call for a review of the formula for the national rollout of the coronavirus vaccine, among other urgent demands ldquoCurrently each Primary Care Networkin England is receiving an equal distribution of vaccines, despite the huge iations in the size of the populations PCNs serve. We call on you to review this formula and urgently scale up vaccine distribution in London, the letter says.While conceding immunising the first four cohorts on the Governmentrsquos vaccination priority list ldquoshould bring down the mortality rate over the next few weeks and months, Mr Khan and Ms Gould expressed frustration that it was currently not possible to roll out the vaccine to the next five, mostly younger, cohorts.ldquoIt is these younger groups, the  to  year olds, that are presenting at hospitals in large numbers, the two leaders said. vw,vw,px, px\"Covid- patients in hospital in England.

As ordinary folk, none of these three ‘coves’ come with the egotism associatedwith this level of stardom. Their down-to-earth attitude, gentle humility and self-confessed naivety of the wider music industry is part of their unique charm and connects them to their fans across the generations who reward them with unwavering loyalty.“The Barrowlands was booked but that sold out just as quickly. Suddenly all the venues sold out, including gigs in London and Manchester. It was unbelievable.”“We are not the type of band that can sit down and invent new materials,” said Innes.“Everything comes out of Boydie’s head and, until it’s ready to be released, it’s not coming. You don’t ask him to do anything. He has a heart of gold and means well to everyone but,you ask him to do something, and he’s not ready for, it will not get done. We are waiting to see what happens with live gigs next year.”Innes confesses to feeling nervous about the uncertainty of the future of live performances. He said: “Over the summer, a lot of people believed the situation with the pandemic would be better but I realised things were getting worse for live music. I really wondered whether Peat  Diesel would ever play live again.“I am, however, a positive person who always sees good things in bad situations. Watching pre-Covid TV programmes where people are sitting closely together does put fear through us though. Until maybe everyone takes this vaccine and Covid goes away, I think live music is really going to struggle.“When we are playing, the crowd sucks up the atmosphere we have created.“If that atmosphere is not there, I don’t think people will enjoy it. For the  tour, I am not sure whether people will be ready to gather or whether they would rather wait that extra while to attend a gig. We will have to wait and see how it goes.”The  tour has been rescheduled for next year, with a gig booked for Skye in the autumn.Innes says he is looking forward to coming back to Skye: “We have played on Skye before and were not sure how they would get us. It was an amazing experience for us, though, as people sang along to the words and really enjoyed the performance.“Despite the sea between us, Skye people are very like us and understand our music.“We decided the tour had to include a venue on Skye as we feel they are our friends and family and a place where we feel at home to be ourselves and enjoy our time there.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/XMAS-HAMPERS-PORTREE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"skye community response well","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSCR chair Ross Cowie said the group — which was set up in March last year in response to the first lockdown — was ready to go and in a stronger position this time around.“We’re back to where we were in the first lockdown but we are better prepared having had that experience and we are ready to help with whatever is required in supporting the community — whether that#s picking up prescriptions, delivering food, fuel, any practical support or just advice.Commenting on the group#s work following the initial lockdown, he added: #We put contingencies in place because we were aware that a second phase was likely, so we have a huge store of personal Protective Equipment for the health care sector or anyone  who requires it.“This time it has been a lot easier than the first time, we were reacting to the situation then and learning as we went along, but now we are well prepared.“We are here, we have the phone line, it#s open five days a week but we can scale it up to seven days a weekneeded.”He added: “We have a great bunch of people on board and we connect with all the other operations throughout the island.”A number of food share and emergency food provision initiatives are in operation throughout the island and are advertised locally —you need further advice you can call the helpline.Prior to Christmas Skye Community Response volunteers provided  festive hampers and  presents to members of the community mainly around the Portree and Braes area but also island-wide for Women’s Aid.“Nobody should hesitate in getting touch, the food shares are there to be used, and we are here to help.“We have a robust set-up, and we can also direct people to the relevant support in their area.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/LOCKDOWN-LITTERPICK-3.jpg","title":"litter pickers aiming to make a clean sweep across","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSkye Lockdown Litterpick was set up to encourage people to clean up their local area during the tier  lockdown from Christmas into the New Year, and to date more than  people have become members of the Facebook group.With the conditions of lockdown now tightened until at least the end of January, Dunvegan resident Jennie Chapman, who set up the group, believes that the virtual community of litter pickers is empowering people on Skye to do their bit inidually for a collective cause.: “The Facebook group provides a virtual community where anyone living on Skye can get involved in picking up litter in their local area during this — now extended — lockdown period.“We will then collate all the information about quantities collected and map the areas covered so that we can see an ever growing picture of community involvement in making the island cleaner.“You will see, on the page announcements, a map that is updated every couple of days at least.” Commenting on the response to the group, she said: “At the time of writing there are  members of the group.“Many of these are people who I am sure have been concerned about this issue for some time and may well have already been regularly picking up litter on walks.“However, it can feel like a bit of an uphill battle when you do it on your own so this virtual community is so encouraging when you begin to see how many others care and are also wanting to do their part.”Highlighting the scope of the problem, she added: “We are certainly finding that across the island some of the worst spots for littering include along road verges, especially on the larger roads, around parking areas and lay bys and in popular walking spots.“The range of things that we are collecting includes absolutely huge numbers of drinks bottles, cans, coffee cups and snack wrappers — especially those thrown from car windows along verges — and random items such as huge builders bags, car exhaust pipes and even dirty nappies and used condoms.”Addressing the tightened restrictions now in place, Jennie said: “Everyone taking part is doing so either on their own or in accordance with all now further tightened legal requirements for meeting outside — so from now that will be only with one other person at most and remaining at full social distance.“We have found that two people working to collect from either side of a road verge works well.“All collections are then reported into the group on Facebook for mapping.“At the time of writing we have so far logged  large bin bags full of rubbish being removed from  dferent locations around the island as well as at least  large objects – and we have at least all of January to go!“You will see from the map that the project has now spread to all four corners of the island.”While Jennie acknowledges that the group itself is not a stand-alone solution to the issue, she does hope that it might have a positive effect and persuade people to think twice about littering.She said: “Although this is a short-term project the longer-term issue is unlikely to go away anytime soon so we hope that at least the project raises awareness of the issue.“And maybe it will encourage some people to take their rubbish home rather than littering the countryside and encourages everyone who takes part in trying to keep their local area clean.“There are lots of us out there and we are all part of a bigger picture.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1610110925376.jpg--uk_approval_for_moderna_vaccine.jpg?1610110925000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210108newsuk

Despite our best efforts and signicant investment in extra resource, some customers may experience slightly longer delivery timescales than our usual service standards. “This is due to the exceptionally high volumes we are seeing, exacerbated by the coronavirus-related measures we have put in place in local mail centres and delivery offices to keep our people and customers safe. “In such cases, we always work hard to get back to providing our usual level of service as quickly as we can.”On its website, Royal Mail advises people in the regions who have been left a “Something for you” card from the service to check its website to learn revised opening hours for when they can collect the item. “If we#ve not left a #Something for you card#, and you do not have alternative arrangements in place, we#re sorry that your mail will not be available for collection,” the advice says. The Daily Mail has reported the CWU has called for the Government to prioritise postal workers on the list of people in line to receive Covid vaccinations, and that BT has also called for its engineers to be added to help with its call-out capabilities.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusFoster defends festive easing of restrictions after Covid- cases riseFirst Minister Arlene Foster has defended the Executive#s decision to relax restrictions over Christmas after hospitals struggled under intense pressure over the weekend.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Foster hits out at #selfish# business owners forcing staff to come into work as further  deaths reportedGran wedding for Ards man after pandemic upsets plansRevealed: The NI town among Royal Mail#s Covid delivery #blackspots#Netflix#s Bloody Sunday apology is good enough for me, says sister of victimRaided for listening to Radio   Belfast hairdresser Shankey stunned by PSNI Covid visitLatest CoronavirusNI shoppers wearing masks but clear #stay at home# message still falling on deaf earsNI health service will have enough capacity for critically ill patients, says chief scientic adviser amid surge in Covid casesFoster hits out at #selfish spirit# of employers forcing staff into work place instead of working from homeMore than , Covid fines issues to people in Northern Ireland since start of pandemicSainsbury#s to enforce mask-wearing in storesLatest from Belfast Survivors want public inquiry into NI facilitiesPay your share to compensate victims, Martin urges ChurchNI universities urged to follow GB and protect student gradesGwyneth Paltrow: I am uncomfortable with fameMI appears ignorant of the rule of law, court told,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

You can give her a proper push and let her enjoy it the way that other kids do.Children#s charity Children Today provided the full amount of £. for the adapted swing, which holds Abby in so she is secure and comfortable.The youngster has Rett syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects brain development, resulting in severe mental and physical disability, which impacts her le in a number of ways including frequent seizures, and an inability to walk, use her hands and communicate verbally.But the adapted swing has brought lots of joy, reassurance and ease to the family as Kelly explained how simple, everyday things can prove to be dficult.Kelly added: Being able to use the swing at home is great. Abby loves the feeling of going back and forth and feeling the wind on her face, she particularly enjoys being pushed by her big brother. She#s out there at every opportunity!Emma Prescott, Charity Director of Children Today Charitable Trust, said they were over the moon to hear how Abby#s adapted swing has benefited her and her family throughout lockdown.She added: As a small charity, which is entirely on voluntary donations, we always welcome contributions. No matter how big or small, each donation makes a big dference to the lives of children and young people, like Abby, living with disabilities across the UK.If you would like to support Children Today or are interested in applying for a grant please visitwww.childrentoday.org.ukor call  .Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Foster hits out at #selfish# business owners forcing staff into work as further  deaths reportedGran wedding for Ards man after pandemic upsets plansRevealed: The NI town among Royal Mail#s Covid delivery #blackspots#Netflix#s Bloody Sunday apology is good enough for me, says sister of victimRaided for listening to Radio   Belfast hairdresser Shankey stunned by PSNI Covid visitLatest Northern IrelandJim Allister#s fury at Department for Communities# Northern Ireland centenary #snub#Belfast fth worst city in UK for traffic congestionNadia Kalinowska#s#s injuries were appalling, court is toldAQE says tranfer test still on and #further clarity# promisedLatest from Belfast Jim Allister#s fury at Department for Communities# Northern Ireland centenary #snub#Belfast fth worst city in UK for traffic congestionUS carries out first execution of female inmate since Nadia Kalinowska#s#s injuries were appalling, court is toldFootball rumours from the media,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Newtownards man Tom Cahoon had spent months planning his dream wedding to Megan Kennedy on March , .But then, with just two weeks to go before the big day, Covid- struck.Tomand Megan , who live in London, met on the Match dating website in the summer of  and got engaged in late . The pandemic forced the couple to make the dficult decision to postpone their wedding to October  last year. As the new date drew closer and more coronavirus restrictions came their way, they feared their nuptials would have to be put on hold a second time. Determined to say I do, they decided on a small ceremony at their local church, St Stephen#s in Dulwich, followed by a reception at the Corinthia Hotel in Whitehall with  guests, in line with the guidelines at that point. Two weeks before the big day, new rules meant the guest list had to be cut again to . It was all so incredibly stressful as we were so disappointed when we couldn#t get married in March. With the rules changing so quickly we really didn#t believe the wedding was going to happen until the actual day, Megan told the Belfast . We couldn#t even let ourselves get excited until the very last minute as we knew there was always a risk it would all get cancelled again. In order to accommodate close family only in their , Megan#s original bridal party of , including seven bridesmaids, had to be rearranged. Instead, she turned to the strongest and bravest women she knows - her two grans, Mary Kennedyand Gillian Holloway , who gladly stepped in. I#m very close to my two grandmothers. They were always going to be my VIP guests on the day so that was a big factor in our decision to go ahead in October just to make sure they could be there with us, she added.

They thought it was ridiculous at first and that we should give their places to others, as our numbers were so limited, she said. When I explained how important it was to me to have them there by my side on the most important day of my le, they both agreed and then got so excited. Tom said: I thought it was a great idea, and what Megan should have done from the very beginning, as I felt her bridal party of  seemed a bit excessive!The couple are hoping to have a bigger wedding celebration this September, using as many of their original plans as possible.Two of the original bridesmaids, Megan#s sister and her cousin, were able to be in the church last October, and happily stood aside in favour of Mary and Gillian, while some others turned up outside afterwards as a surprise. They were totally understanding about the fact that we had to make some cutthroat decisions, Megan added. They thought it was a really nice idea to ask my grandmothers instead. All being well they#ll still get to step into the roles and wear their bridesmaid dresses as planned this September. Tom explained that many of his family and friends had also been due to fly over to join the celebrations. In the end it was just my parents Jill and Ernie, who travelled over from Ards along with my brother John from Belfast, while my sister Naomi came from Dublin. My other two sisters, Sarah and Hannah, live in London, but my brother Nathan, who is in Edinburgh, missed the wedding as he developed Covid symptoms and had to self-isolate, he said. Thankfully, he tested negative in the end, but my best friend had to step in and act as best man instead.Hopefully, Nathan will be able to make it in September along with a lot of my dad#s side of the family from Cookstown.Megan added: There#s still a lot of uncertainty over whether our venue and vendors will all still be in business by then, butthe reception goes ahead without any restrictions it#ll be a very much-needed reunion and party for everyone after all this time.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusFoster defends festive easing of restrictions after Covid- cases riseFirst Minister Arlene Foster has defended the Executive#s decision to relax restrictions over Christmas after hospitals struggled under intense pressure over the weekend.Coronavirus PremiumICU nurse warns of coronavirus pressures on traumatised staff as they take sick leave or quit altogetherAn ICU nurse has described in harrowing detail the devastating pressures being experienced by staff caring for some of the sickest people here.VideoCoronavirus PremiumBallynahinch woman Mona Carlisle receives Covid- vaccine just weeks before th birthdayIt#s the birthday present of the century - a precious Covid- vaccine for Mona Carlisle.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Foster hits out at #selfish# business owners forcing staff into work as further  deaths reportedGran wedding for Ards man after pandemic upsets plansRevealed: The NI town among Royal Mail#s Covid delivery #blackspots#Netflix#s Bloody Sunday apology is good enough for me, says sister of victimRaided for listening to Radio   Belfast hairdresser Shankey stunned by PSNI Covid visitLatest Northern Ireland#A great ambassador for NI# tributes to Norman HoustonPeople could miss vaccine letters over mail delivery problems: MLAThe Big Ask: #I think of myself as being east Belfast born, bred, buttered and battered,# says DUP#s Gavin RobinsonTV drama planned on arrests of Loughinisland journalistsBig smiles: Carrick girl Abby Paton#s flying high with her new swing Latest from Belfast #A great ambassador for NI# tributes to Norman HoustonPeople could miss vaccine letters over mail delivery problems: MLAThe Big Ask: #I think of myself as being east Belfast born, bred, buttered and battered,# says DUP#s Gavin RobinsonVaccine arrival doesn#t mean it#s #party time# Daily headlinesTV drama planned on arrests of Loughinisland journalists,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They were speaking after the chair of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee in the Republic said vaccination of people who have already had Covid- may be delayed there. NIAC chair Professor Karina Butler said: There is a suggestion coming out thatyou have had Covid, you might be fairly well protected for six months and in that case, we might find the advice will change and it will say, #If you have had Covid, wait the six months and then get it [the vaccine]. Prof Butler said it may be a way of increasing the number of people immune to the virus by only vaccinating those who need the jab. However, the Department of Health here last night said: The Covid- vaccination programme is being implemented in line with the recommendations from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . JCVI constantly review all the available medical and scientic evidence and provide updated advice as necessary. We are not aware of any plans to change the current advice in relation to the Covid- vaccination programme. At present vaccination is recommended for the vast majority of iniduals, regardless of whether or not they previously had Covid-. It comes as a number of GP surgeries claimed they are still in the dark over the roll-out of the Covid- vaccine to their patients. Belfast solicitor Claire McKeegan, from Phoenix Law, said she has been instructed by a GP practice which has more than , patients but has so far only received  doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. She said her client has asked health bosses when further doses of the vaccine will be delivered but no information has been provided. However, the Department of Health last night released its ambitious schedule for the largest mass vaccination programme ever undertaken by the NHS. According to the document, health bosses in Northern Ireland expect phase one of the programme, which started in December, to be completed by the end of this month. Phase one includes , care home residents and , care home staff who are receiving two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. It also includes , health and social care staff, who are also getting the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, and , people aged  and over, who are to be vaccinated with Oxford AstraZeneca jab by GPs and district nurses. Phase two of the programme is due to begin next month in five-year tranches, beginning with patients aged  and over, before moving on to those people who are  and over, then the over-s - a total of more than , people. The programme will then move on to the clinically vulnerable under  years and the , people who have been shielding, and , people considered moderately vulnerable. The third phase is due to begin in the spring and will include patients in tranches from  to -year-olds who have not already been vaccinated. An exact start date has not been provided as it is dependent on vaccine availability.Belfast Related ContentVideoNews Analysis PremiumNI shoppers wearing masks but clear #stay at home# message still falling on deaf earsEmpty shelves... what empty shelves  There were very few of them in Belfast’s biggest supermarkets yesterday, despite warnings of food shortages caused by the new year double whammy of Covid- and Brexit-era teething problems.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Foster hits out at #selfish# business owners forcing staff into work as further  deaths reportedGran wedding for Ards man after pandemic upsets plansRevealed: The NI town among Royal Mail#s Covid delivery #blackspots#Netflix#s Bloody Sunday apology is good enough for me, says sister of victimRaided for listening to Radio   Belfast hairdresser Shankey stunned by PSNI Covid visitLatest Northern IrelandBelfast fth worst city in UK for traffic congestionNadia Kalinowska#s#s injuries were appalling, court is toldAQE says tranfer test still on and #further clarity# promisedChristine Lampard cannot wait for her second child to arriveJust do right thing to keep us safe, says PSNI chiefLatest from Belfast Jim Allister#s fury at Department for Communities# Northern Ireland centenary #snub#Belfast fth worst city in UK for traffic congestionNadia Kalinowska#s#s injuries were appalling, court is toldFootball rumours from the mediaAQE says tranfer test still on and #further clarity# promised,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I love the part I played in that, he added.He had been furloughed for months before the decision was made.When the news came in that it was all over, I#d already seen the way things were going, so I wasn#t surprised by it, he said.I#ll always say that from the moment ITV took over a few years ago both myself and Gillian were treated like royalty as the continuity announcers.They treated us like part of the family. They were very, very good to us. I#ve no complaints at all.ITV said: We#d like to apologise for the continuity error last night before View From Stormont.This was human error and we have reviewed procedures to ensure that this won#t happen again.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Foster hits out at #selfish# business owners forcing staff into work as further  deaths reportedGran wedding for Ards man after pandemic upsets plansRevealed: The NI town among Royal Mail#s Covid delivery #blackspots#Netflix#s Bloody Sunday apology is good enough for me, says sister of victimRaided for listening to Radio   Belfast hairdresser Shankey stunned by PSNI Covid visitLatest Northern IrelandNadia Kalinowska#s#s injuries were appalling, court is toldAQE says tranfer test still on and #further clarity# promisedChristine Lampard cannot wait for her second child to arriveJust do right thing to keep us safe, says PSNI chiefCovid vaccine jab ‘doesn’t mean it’s party time in Northern Ireland,# warns chief medic Michael McBrideLatest from Belfast Nadia Kalinowska#s#s injuries were appalling, court is toldFootball rumours from the mediaAQE says tranfer test still on and #further clarity# promisedChristine Lampard cannot wait for her second child to arriveDeclan BogueOpinionTough task, but All-Stars fallout is a certainty,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The couple are in a support bubble and given the devastating impact the pandemic has had on his business he said said he would be a stickler for following the rules. However, his world got turned upside down, when a knock came at the door. Cops just raided my home, he posted on Facebook on Saturday evening.Just me and her, listening to tunes. They were phoned to say I was having fun and was having a party. This is real.Speaking to the Belfast , the salon owner said he was so stunned at the visit he allowed the PPE-clad officers, in to see for themselves. I had nothing to hide, so of course let them in, he said.I presume a neighbour saw my girlfriend#s car and thought to report it. There was no loud music or anything.It really felt like my house was violated. I just could not understand it.Mr Shankey said he called the police on Sunday and was informed a report had been made of a suspected breach of the coronavirus rules at his address, however nothing was found. I was angry, he added, who does this The police were courteous and polite, but for all you hear of what is going on did they need to be at my door on a Saturday night Mr Shankey said he and his girlfriend had both suffered a bout of the flu and he was so ill he could not take himself to a Covid testing centre. Saturday night was the first time they had seen each other in a while. He stressed they not only followed the rules, but had been isolating separately. He added: It was so annoying to hear. I wear masks, I follow the rules. My business has been closed down for the government. My staff are out of work, I am out of work, I just want to see the end of this. We all need to follow the rules.Justice Minister Naomi Long was tagged in Jason#s social media post. She responded to say he should write to the chief constable andnot satisfied should contact the Police Ombudsman.Police said they received a report of anti-social behaviour at a house in the Sydenham area on Saturday evening.Officers attended and no offences were detected at the time, a spokesman added.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Foster hits out at #selfish# business owners forcing staff into work as further  deaths reportedGran wedding for Ards man after pandemic upsets plansRevealed: The NI town among Royal Mail#s Covid delivery #blackspots#Netflix#s Bloody Sunday apology is good enough for me, says sister of victimRaided for listening to Radio   Belfast hairdresser Shankey stunned by PSNI Covid visitLatest Northern IrelandThe Big Ask: #I think of myself as being east Belfast born, bred, buttered and battered,# says DUP#s Gavin RobinsonTV drama planned on arrests of Loughinisland journalistsBig smiles: Carrick girl Abby Paton#s flying high with her new swing Jim Allister#s fury at Department for Communities# Northern Ireland centenary #snub#Belfast fth worst city in UK for traffic congestionLatest from Belfast The Big Ask: #I think of myself as being east Belfast born, bred, buttered and battered,# says DUP#s Gavin RobinsonVaccine arrival doesn#t mean it#s #party time# Daily headlinesTV drama planned on arrests of Loughinisland journalistsBig smiles: Carrick girl Abby Paton#s flying high with her new swing Jim Allister#s fury at Department for Communities# Northern Ireland centenary #snub#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Olympic pentathlon gold medallist, Lady Mary Peters, and former Ireland and Lions rugby international Nigel Carr have confirmed that they are winding up their Ulster Sports Museum charity.Despite many pledges and promises of support, and offers of historic sporting exhibits, they say their efforts floundered due to a lack of real commitment to financial support from government.Both said they felt the museum would have paid for itself, as a tourist attraction and an inspiration to future generations. Over  leading sporting figures had already agreed to become patrons of the museum.Lady Mary#s  Munich Olympic gold medal is currently on loan display at the Ulster Museum but she would dearly love to see it on permanent display in a sports museum here, having won it for Northern Ireland.The major stumbling block for the project is money and sustainability through a guaranteed long term funding stream.Mr McCausland, who served as Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure between  and , has expressed his disappointment that the museum bid has halted due to lack of funding. He said: Northern Ireland has a rich sporting tradition and that is reflected in the success of our current sporting heroes such as Jonathan Rea, Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell.Countries around the world celebrate their sporting heritage and it is regrettable that Northern Ireland is still without a sports museum.The former DUP MLA for North Belfast added: Those who have championed this vision down through the years deserve credit for their endeavour and it is something that the Executive should now be embedding in its future plan.A sports museum would not be just about looking back and celebrating success, it would also support the vision of a shared future by reminding us of some of the things we shared in the past. When Mary Peters achieved her Olympic success, people from every community in Northern Ireland celebrated with her. Such shared experiences help to build a shared future.It would also inspire our up and coming sports men and women and encourage participation in sport - which is one of the best ways of tackling the problem of obesity.With all the benefits that could flow from a Northern Ireland Sports Museum it is a project that should not be allowed to wither away.Gary McAllister, from the Amalgamation of Official Northern Ireland Supporters Clubs, added: I#m sure, like me, many people will be disappointed to hear this news.Northern Ireland has such a rich history of sporting achievement, something which has shone a positive light on our country during many dficult times.Hopefully this is something that could be revisited in the future, because I believe there is a lot of potential to attract large numbers to a location which could incorporate football and all of our sporting history, Mr McAllister added.

On Sunday, we had  trucks parked up in a port that has a normal traffic of .m freight vehicles through it.But one industry source said drivers are being held up for hours or even days at a time in Dublin over customs formalities, a situation that is being compounded by Covid restrictions.And Logistics UK, which represents UK drivers, retailers and manufacturers, says consignments of dferent goods that are grouped together in the same container are facing particular problems crossing the Irish Sea.The head of the Irish Road Haulage Association, Eugene Drennan, said most of the delays are down to cumbersome IT systems and new rules that were not tried and tested in time.The biggest flaw in it all is that the Irish system does not talk to the English system, Mr Drennan said. There might be no problem now because there are no goods. But it#s on the way.One driver turned up for health and safety clearance on Saturday with no paperwork, and had to wait  hours until a customs agent was available to provide it.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Foster hits out at #selfish# business owners forcing staff into work as further  deaths reportedGran wedding for Ards man after pandemic upsets plansRevealed: The NI town among Royal Mail#s Covid delivery #blackspots#Netflix#s Bloody Sunday apology is good enough for me, says sister of victimRaided for listening to Radio   Belfast hairdresser Shankey stunned by PSNI Covid visitLatest Republic of IrelandPay your share to compensate victims, Martin urges ChurchTaoiseach to deliver apology for Ireland’s mother and baby homesAll passengers into Ireland will have to provide negative Covid testCatholic archbishop apologises to survivors of homesLatest from Belfast Businesses pessimistic over Brexit and lockdownsCovid vaccine jab ‘doesn’t mean it’s party time in Northern Ireland,# warns chief medic Michael McBrideNI shoppers wearing masks but clear #stay at home# message still falling on deaf earsAlban MaginnessOpinionStormont#s marriage of convenience fails another big examResidents cry foul after suffering stench from landfill site for months,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Although only detailed family history research will confirm the actual Irish origins of your ancestors, surname histories can provide clues and insight into family origins. The  Foyle Community Directory lists , unique surnames in Derry city. Each of these surnames bears a distinctive history and taken as a whole they are a record of population movements into the Derry area over the past  years. Derry’s dynamic history can be seen in the richness and iety of her surnames. googletag.cmd.push The three commonest names have Donegal origins with Doherty heading the way with  entries, followed by McLaughlin on  and Gallagher with  entries. By way of contrast,  surnames occur only once.  Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan and sept names. From the th century each family began to adopt its own distinctive family name generally derived from the first name of an ancestor who lived in or about the th century. The surname was formed by prefixing either ‘Mac’or ‘O’to the ancestor’s name. googletag.cmd.push Surnames in Ireland, therefore, tended to identy membership of a ‘sept’. A sept can be identied as ‘a group of persons who, or whose immediate and known ancestors, bore a common surname and inhabited the same locality’. As a consequence, Gaelic-Irish surnames are still very dominant and numerous in the very districts where their names originated. By tradition, many of the prominent surnames of Gaelic origin in Counties Derry, Donegal and Tyrone today trace their descent from either Eoghan or Conal Gulban, two of the sons of Niall of the Nine Hostages, King of Tara who was slain in  AD.     Those tracing descent from Eoghan include: Brolly, Carlin, Devlin, Donnelly, Duddy, Duffy, Farren, Gormley, Hegarty, McCloskey, McLaughlin, Mellon, Mullen, O’Hagan, O’Kane, O’Neill, Quinn and Toner. From Conall Gulban: Doherty, Friel, Gallagher, McCafferty, McDaid, McDevitt and O’Donnell. By tradition, Eoghan and Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland about  AD, and in the process captured the great hill-top fortication of Grianaacuten of Aileach in Inishowen, County Donegal which overlooks the city of Derry and the surrounding countryside. Although Gaelic society was one of the first to adopt a system of hereditary surnames it was also one of the last to perpetuate fixed surnames. People in these societies, in the early th century, were often designated by their genealogies stretching back five or more generations. For example, Shane O’Neill of Shane’s Castle, County Antrim, styled himself on the family vault, which he built in , as ‘Shane McBrien McPhelim McShane McBrien McPhelim O’Neill Esq’. Here is family history in one name stretching back over  years. The last-named Phelim was Felim ‘The Lame’ who was Prince of Clanaboy from  to . The Genealogical Office manuscript collections in Office of the Chief Herald at National Library of Ireland, Dublin are the most important source for the genealogies of Gaelic families and of those families entitled to bear arms either by hereditary right or by grant. On th July , Dr Ramon Salvador O’Dogherty of San Fernando, near Cadiz, Spain was inaugurated as the th O’Dochartaigh, chief of Inishowen, County Donegal. The inauguration ceremony took place on the original ‘crowning stone’, known today as ‘St Columb’s Stone’, inside the walled garden in the grounds of the former Belmont House School, Racecourse Road, Derry, using the ancient ceremonial ritual of the clan: the claimant to the title of ‘The O’Doherty’ standing barefoot on the stone, holding a white wand of hazel wood. By tradition, the crowning stone, blessed by Saint Columba, was carried to Belmont from Grianan of Aileach. By tradition, Grianan is identied as being the great “royal fort” of Aileach, the citadel of the northern Ui Neill from the th to the th century. With the Genealogical Office manuscript collections a family chart can be constructed which, on the male line, records the ancestors of Ramon O’Dogherty, “Chief of the Name”, back through  generations to Niall of the Nine Hostages, th century High King of Ireland Ramon O’Dogherty is descended from Sean, brother of Sir Cahir O’Doherty , who fled from Inishowen to County Cavan and whose descendants settled in Spain, as nobility, in the th century. The founder of the Spanish branch of the O’Doghertys was John who, on the death of his father Eoghan in , came out with his brothers Henry and Clinton Dillon to pursue a career in the Spanish Navy, the most exclusive branch of the Spanish armed forces. Entry required them to show their genealogy, proving noble origin. In  the King of Arms in Dublin Castle confirmed the three brothers as being “descended in a direct line from Shane or Sir John O’Dogherty, Chief of Innish-Owen”. In the th century substantial numbers of English and Scottish families settled in the northern part of Ireland during the so-called Plantation of Ulster. These settlers came to Ulster, by and large, in three waves: with the granting of the initial leases in the period  to  after  and Cromwell’s crushing of the Irish rebellion and, finally, in the fteen years after  and the Glorious Revolution. Famine in Scotlandfrom -, together with landlords in Ulster actively seeking new tenants, resulted in a massive influx of Scottish settlers to Ulster in the s. Substantial numbers of Scottish families entered Ulster through Derry and settled in the Foyle Valley which includes much of the fertile lands of Counties Donegal, Londonderry and Tyrone. The lands along the Firth of Clyde in Ayrshire the Clyde Valley Wigtown, Kirkcudbright and Dumfries in Galloway and the Border Lands of Berwick, Peebles, Selkirk and Roxburgh were home to many of these Scottish settlers. Hence surnames such as Anderson, Arbuckle, Armstrong, Barr, Beattie, Bell, Buchanan, Burns, Campbell, Carruthers, Colhoun, Craig, Cunningham, Dunlop, Elliott, Ferguson, Finlay, Fleming, Frazer, Gillespie, Graham, Grant, Hamilton, Hanna, Haslett, Henderson, Holmes, Houston, Irvine, Irwin, Johnston, Kennedy, Kilgore, Lindsay, McAllister, McCartney, McClean, McClelland, McClintock, McCorkell, McCormick, McDonald, Miller, Mitchell, Montgomery, Moore, Olphert, Orr, Parkhill, Patterson, Patton, Rankin, Robb, Rosborough, Ross, Scott, Starrett, Stewart, Thompson, Wallace, Wilson and Young have been established in northwest Ireland for well over three centuries. More recent arrivals from outside the British Isles have also contributed a small but interesting collection of surnames in the Derry area. An Italian community with surnames such as Battisti, Caffola, Cassoni, Centra, Corrieri, Del Pinto, Fiorentini, Forte, Macari, Vaccaro and Yannarelli settled in Derry in the s. A Jewish community with names such as Schenkel, Szilagyi, Spain and Watchman settled in Derry and worshipped in a synagogue in Kennedy Place, and a thriving Indian Community, represented by surnames such as Chada, Singh, Vig and Vij, has been established in the city since the s, most of whom originate from the Punjab in northern India. The family histories associated with surname histories in Derry will, in many instances, be recorded in the database of Derry Genealogy at www.derry.rootsireland.ie.  The database of Derry Genealogy contains the bulk of pre- civil birth and marriage registers for the city and county of Derry, the early baptismal and marriage registers of  churches , gravestone inscriptions from  graveyards, and census substitutes and census s dating from  to . Starting in Mondays Derry News, we look in depth at the history of our local surnames. First up are the four most common - Doherty, McLaughlin, Gallagher and Kelly.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Within days, the pressure that the system was under was evident through the images shown across media outlets of multiple ambulances queuing outside Emergency Departments. We also highlighted that there was a very real risk that hospitals could be overwhelmed in the event of a further COVID- spike in January. googletag.cmd.push “Although dferent parts of the country are in dferent stages of the third COVID- surge, and inidual hospitals are reflecting this, the situation is very serious with modelling projections indicating that in the third week in January we will be trying to contend with double the number of COVID positive patients compared to the current position today, when several hospitals already have record numbers of patients. “This is not a simple matter of putting up more beds. We need the staff to care for the increased number of patients. Pre-existing staffing pressures and staff absence because of COVID, and other reasons, mean that those staff simply aren’t there. googletag.cmd.push “Already several Trusts are having to stand down all but the most urgent elective surgery, including some red-flag cancer surgery, to redeploy staff to meet the urgent and immediate needs of extremely ill patients, especially both COVID and non-COVID patients needing ICU care. “These postponed operations will be rescheduled as soon as possible. We have established a regional approach to ensure that any available theatre capacity across Northern Ireland is allocated for those patients most in need of surgery, both during surge and as we come out of this surge. “This may mean that patients will need to travel further for their surgery. Cancer services are seeking to maintain chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other non-surgical treatments and alternative treatments will be provided in the absence of surgical options.     “We know that we speak for all health and social care staff in assuring the public that we will do everything that we possibly can to deal with the situation that is unfolding. Our staff, although exhausted, will once more go above and beyond to do the best they can for as many people as possible, and we thank them for it. “It will definitely not be easy and the care that we are able to provide will at times fall short of the high standards we normally deliver but we will do our very best. Desperately ill patients whether COVID or non-COVID will always be the ones being prioritised. “No-one should be attending an Emergency Department at any time unless they need emergency care. It is likely that those who do attend will wait longer to be seen and for admission to hospitalthat is what they require. “Patients arriving by ambulance will also wait at times, sometimes for many hours before space is available in an already over-stretched ED. This has a direct impact on the ability of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service to respond, in a timely manner, to le threatening emergencies in the community. “Patients also need to leave hospital as soon as they are medically fit to leave. We will work tirelessly to ensure that this happens. That might mean accepting a placement where it is available and it might also mean families having to go the extra mile to provide temporary support for relatives. But we will need every bed that we have for those that are most in need. “Pressure in one part of the health and social care system inevitably impacts on the other parts. For example, we might once again need families to be willing to fill unavoidable gaps in domiciliary care. “Never has the phrase ‘all in it together’ been so pertinent and just so important. The COVID- vaccines provide the long-term hope and the current lockdown offers the opportunity to shorten the duration of the current surge. The public can play their part too by staying at home, practising social distancing and good hand hygiene and wearing face coverings. “We thank you in advance for your assistance.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

When this equipment is damaged maliciously, the vandals can be contributing towards someone losing their le where it would otherwise be saved, and are putting at risk the lives of people from the local community who use lough and riverside walks. googletag.cmd.push “This type of behaviour is extremely irresponsible and could have serious consequences, so we would ask thatmembers of the public do notice or witness any damage to these devices anywhere along the walk that they report it to the police or the council immediately, to allow us to replace the equipment before any one is put in danger.” The throwlines are essential, potentially lesaving equipment that can make a dference to someone in trouble in the water where they are unable to assist themselves or until rescue services can reach the scene Members of the public can report instances of tampering with le preserving equipment at any Council owned site by phoning the PSNI on , contacting the Council’s Parks and Outdoor Recreation service on    or through the council’s social media channels on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The sooner we get it up and going the better, because it was a great event,” he said. “I enjoyed it best out of any event the council held – not just the free grub and glass of wine – but the place was always packed.” Limavady councillor Brenda Chivers spoke against the plans, calling for any available money to be spread equally across the Borough.     “Causeway Coast and Glens is a lot more than Portrush,” she said. “Portrush had the golf, they benefited from the Milk Cup and the North West , what about other parts  “If you go into Limavady, they say everything is in Portrush or Portstewart, and then you have Arlene Foster giving off about people flocking there at the weekend. They benefit a lot more than the rest of the councils areas so I think we should spread the money around.” The motion was proposed by Cllr Aaron Callan of Limavady. Cllr Orla Beattie also raised concerns around the linking of the event with the Queens Platinum Jubilee, and felt the event could be more inclusive. “We have serious reservations with it being linked to the Queens Platinum Jubilee. It doesnt make it more signicant to me or necessarily the people I represent. “To make the air show a key regional event, rather than an event for our Borough, we need it to be inclusive. “By associating it with the Queen, were automatically excluding people who might have otherwise attended.” An amendment from Sinn Feacutein councillor Oliver McMullan asking that the proposal be held until proper discussion could be held how tourism funding is allocated fell by  votes to . After the council had passed the original motion by  votes to , Cllr McMullan askedan equality impact assessment would be carried out on the councils distribution of funds towards tourism. “And agree with the equality impact assessment on the play park named after a terrorist ” replied Cllr Callan. Mayor Fielding informed them that the motion was now done and dusted. A project board involving no more than six elected members, appointed by the DHondt system, will now be set up to develop the event further. In a statement released after the meeting, Bann councillor, Helena Dallat ODriscoll, said the council needs to be mindful of their carbon footprint. “This motion does not sit well for a number of reasons, not least of all because it flies in the face of our own environmental policies,” she said. “Aviation has a huge impact on the atmosphere. The stark reality of climate change is with us and tackling carbon footprint is a challenge we must face. “As elected representatives, we must be seen to take action to address the impact of rising temperatures caused by human generated emissions. “This is no niche political hobby horse - it’s an emergency and it demands immediate action at local level, as well as national and international level. “This proposal far from demonstrates a commitment to reducing the impact on the environment and making a global dference.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

While Irecognisethat Covid-has led to reduced staff numbers andonline shoppinghasadded signicant pressure to Royal Mail, residents in BT and BT should receive their mail in a timely manner. “While I acknowledge the hard work and long hours of local post workers, this situation is far from acceptable.I will be contacting Royal Mail to see what plans they can put in place to relieve thelocal pressure and provide some urgent clarity for residents.” googletag.cmd.push Mr McGlone said the situation would be distressing at anytime, but is particularly worrying when many elderlyresidentsare waiting on a letter informing them about the Covidvaccine.

In this, the first of a series of articles on the most common  local surnames, he explores the background of the names Doherty, McLaughlin, Gallagher and Kelly.  - DOHERTY The surname Doherty, which is by far the most popular name in the city of Derry and the Inishowen peninsula, County Donegal, illustrates the very close links between these two areas. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Inishowen. googletag.cmd.push The Doherty sept trace their lineage to Conall Gulban, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Conall and his brother Eogan conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech which commanded the entrance to Inishowen between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. googletag.cmd.push The Dohertys take their name from Dochartach, twelfth in lineal descent from Conall Gulban and were thus in Gaelic O Dochartaigh. The word dochartach means ‘hurtful’. The original seat of the Doherty clan was at Ardmire or Ard Miodhair, a district to the west of Ballybofey near Lough Finn, County Donegal. In  Donnell Carragh O’Doherty was styled ‘Royal Chieftain of Ardmire’. As the original homeland of the Cenel Eoghainin Inishowen became more and more a northern outpost, as they expanded south and east, the O’Dohertys, a powerful branch of the Cenel Conaill , forced their way into Inishowen.     When Conor O’Doherty died in  he was styled ‘Chief of Ardmire, and Lord of Inishowen’. The Dohertys remained the chief family of Inishowen until their influence was broken after the rebellion of Sir Cahir O’Doherty in , which included the ransacking of the city of Derry. The defeat and execution of Sir Cahir O’Doherty marked the end of Doherty power and paved the way for the th century Plantation of Ulster with English and Scottish settlers. In the centuries that followed the name was anglicised with many iant spellings and in nearly all cases the O prefix was dropped. By  only  per cent were still using it. However, in the th century, many resumed it and by  half of the Dohertys in Ireland had become O’Doherty again.In the th and th centuries many descendants of the old Gaelic order in Ireland emigrated, as the so-called Wild Geese, to Europe, and, in particular, to Spain and France. Dr Ramon Salvador O’Dogherty of San Fernando, near Cadiz, Spain was inaugurated in July  as the th O’Dochartaigh, chief of Inishowen. Ramon O’Dogherty is descended from Sir Cahir’s brother John who fled from Inishowen to County Cavan and whose descendants settled in Spain, as nobility, in the th century. The inauguration ceremony took place on the original ‘crowning stone’, which tradition states was carried from Grianan, in the grounds of the former Belmont House School in Derry, using the ancient ceremonial ritual of the clan: The claimant to the title of ‘The O’Doherty’ standing barefoot on the stone, holding a white wand of hazel wood.   – MCLAUGHLIN  The surname McLaughlin, which is second to Doherty in both Derry city and Inishowen, County Donegal, illustrates the very close links between these two areas. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Inishowen. Today, % of Donegal McLaughlins are still concentrated in the Inishowen peninsula. The McLaughlin sept trace their lineage to Eogan, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Eogan and his brother Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech which commanded the entrance to the Inishowen peninsula between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Eogan, styled ‘King of Ailech’, established his own kingdom in the peninsula still called after him Inishowen . Eogan was converted to Christianity by St Patrick, when he travelled to Ailech, ca.  AD. His descendants, known as the Cenel Eoghain , became the principal branch of the Northern Ui Neill . The Cenel Eoghain in the next five centuries expanded to the east and south from their focal point in Inishowen. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. The McLaughlins take their name from Lochlainn, which in turn was derived from a Norse personal name, and were thus in Gaelic Mac Lochlainn, i.e. son of Lochlainn. The McLaughlins were initially the senior branch of the Northern Ui Neill and their territory was in Inishowen. In the th century the McLaughlins, ruling from their royal palace at Ailech in Inishowen, were High Kings of Ireland and patrons of the monastic settlement in Derry. Domhnall Mac Lochlainn, styled ‘King of Ireland’, died at Doire-Choluim-Chillein . After a decisive battle in  at Caimeirgethe O’Neills of Tyrone ousted the McLaughlins as the leading power in Ulster. Brian O’Neill was now ‘installed in the lordship of the Kinel-Owen’. In the th century the Dohertys ousted the McLaughlins as Lords of Inishowen. Some McLaughlins in Ulster, particularly Antrim, may derive from the Argyllshire clan known in Scotland as MacLachlan. The O’Melaghlins of north Leinster have also changed their name to McLaughlin.   - GALLAGHER  Gallagher is the third most common name in Ulster and two-thirds of the Ulster total are in the sept’s homeland of County Donegal where it is the most numerous name. Although it is only the thirteenth most common name in County Derry, it is the third most numerous in the city of Derry. This name illustrates the very close links between the city of Derry and County Donegal. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Donegal. The Gallagher sept trace their lineage to Conall Gulban, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Conall and his brother Eogan conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech in County Donegal which commanded the entrance to Inishowen between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Conall, styled ‘King of Tir Conaill’, established his own kingdom in County Donegal called after him Tyrconnel, i.e. the ‘Land of Conall’, which was the ancient name of Donegal. His descendants, known as the Cenel Conaill , formed one of the principal branches of the Northern Ui Neill . The septs of the Cenel Conaill firmly established themselves in County Donegal while those descended from Conal’s brother Eogan expanded to the east and south into Counties Derry and Tyrone. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. The Gallaghers take their name from Gallchobhair, and were thus in Gaelic O Gallchobhair, i.e. descendant of Gallagher. This name is derived from gallchobhar, meaning ‘foreign help’. The O’Gallaghers claim to be the senior and most loyal family of the Cenel Conaill. Their territory extended over a wide area in the baronies of Raphoe and Tirhugh in the east and south of County Donegal. The O’Gallaghers, from their bases at Ballybeit and Ballynaglack, were chief marshals and commanders of O’Donnell’s military forces from the th to the th centuries. The O’Gallaghers also provided many wives for the O’Donnell sept. As well as being a military family the Gallaghers have produced many churchmen. Six O’Gallaghers were bishops of Raphoe in the th and th centuries, and Redmond O Gallagher, the th century Bishop of Derry, befriended the survivors of the Spanish Armada. Today the name is found widely in Scotland where it often takes the form Gallacher. It also occurs in the English cities of Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds where it is pronounced ‘Gallocher’.   – KELLY  Kelly is the second commonest family name in Ireland, after Murphy, and part of the reason is that, at least seven and possibly as many as ten distinct septs of the same name arose in dferent parts of the country. Kelly is the sixth most common name in Ulster, and the third most numerous in Counties Derry and Tyrone. The Kelly sept of County Derry trace their lineage to Eogan, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Eogan and his brother Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech in County Donegal. Eogan, styled ‘King of Ailech’, established his own kingdom in the peninsula in County Donegal still called after him Inishowen . His descendants, known as the Cenel Eoghain , became the principal branch of the Northern Ui Neill . The Cenel Eoghain in the next five centuries expanded to the east and south from their focal point in Inishowen. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. Kelly is derived from Gaelic O Ceallaigh, the root word possibly being ceallach meaning stre. The O’Kellys were one of the leading septs of Clan Binnypossessing territory on the banks of the River Foyle near Lford in County Donegal. The first outward thrust of the Owen clan was that of Clan Binny in the th century AD who thrust southeast into County Tyrone, bypassing a hard core of resistance in County Derry of the Cianachta, as far as the river Blackwater on the borders of Tyrone and Armagh. Clan Binny eventually ousted the Oriella clans from the district lying west of the river Bann from Coleraine to beside Lough Neagh, and drove them across the river. In the course of time the O’Kellys moved eastwards into County Derry and were based in the barony of Loughinsholin in south Derry. The most powerful Kelly sept was that of Ui Maine, often called Hy Many, who ruled O’Kelly’s Country in Counties Galway and Roscommon. This sept claims descent from the th century Colla da Crioch, King of Ulster and first King of Oriel. Other O’Kelly septs originated in Counties Kilkenny, Leix, Meath, Sligo and Wicklow. Kelly was known as a surname in Scotland long before th century Irish immigration really established the name there. There was, for example, a Kelly sept attached to Clan Donald.

In this, the first of a series of articles on the most common  local surnames, he explores the background of the names Doherty, McLaughlin, Gallagher and Kelly.  - DOHERTY The surname Doherty, which is by far the most popular name in the city of Derry and the Inishowen peninsula, County Donegal, illustrates the very close links between these two areas. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Inishowen. googletag.cmd.push The Doherty sept trace their lineage to Conall Gulban, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Conall and his brother Eogan conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech which commanded the entrance to Inishowen between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. googletag.cmd.push The Dohertys take their name from Dochartach, twelfth in lineal descent from Conall Gulban and were thus in Gaelic O Dochartaigh. The word dochartach means ‘hurtful’. The original seat of the Doherty clan was at Ardmire or Ard Miodhair, a district to the west of Ballybofey near Lough Finn, County Donegal. In  Donnell Carragh O’Doherty was styled ‘Royal Chieftain of Ardmire’. As the original homeland of the Cenel Eoghainin Inishowen became more and more a northern outpost, as they expanded south and east, the O’Dohertys, a powerful branch of the Cenel Conaill , forced their way into Inishowen.     When Conor O’Doherty died in  he was styled ‘Chief of Ardmire, and Lord of Inishowen’. The Dohertys remained the chief family of Inishowen until their influence was broken after the rebellion of Sir Cahir O’Doherty in , which included the ransacking of the city of Derry. The defeat and execution of Sir Cahir O’Doherty marked the end of Doherty power and paved the way for the th century Plantation of Ulster with English and Scottish settlers. In the centuries that followed the name was anglicised with many iant spellings and in nearly all cases the O prefix was dropped. By  only  per cent were still using it. However, in the th century, many resumed it and by  half of the Dohertys in Ireland had become O’Doherty again.In the th and th centuries many descendants of the old Gaelic order in Ireland emigrated, as the so-called Wild Geese, to Europe, and, in particular, to Spain and France. Dr Ramon Salvador O’Dogherty of San Fernando, near Cadiz, Spain was inaugurated in July  as the th O’Dochartaigh, chief of Inishowen. Ramon O’Dogherty is descended from Sir Cahir’s brother John who fled from Inishowen to County Cavan and whose descendants settled in Spain, as nobility, in the th century. The inauguration ceremony took place on the original ‘crowning stone’, which tradition states was carried from Grianan, in the grounds of the former Belmont House School in Derry, using the ancient ceremonial ritual of the clan: The claimant to the title of ‘The O’Doherty’ standing barefoot on the stone, holding a white wand of hazel wood.   – MCLAUGHLIN  The surname McLaughlin, which is second to Doherty in both Derry city and Inishowen, County Donegal, illustrates the very close links between these two areas. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Inishowen. Today, % of Donegal McLaughlins are still concentrated in the Inishowen peninsula. The McLaughlin sept trace their lineage to Eogan, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Eogan and his brother Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech which commanded the entrance to the Inishowen peninsula between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Eogan, styled ‘King of Ailech’, established his own kingdom in the peninsula still called after him Inishowen . Eogan was converted to Christianity by St Patrick, when he travelled to Ailech, ca.  AD. His descendants, known as the Cenel Eoghain , became the principal branch of the Northern Ui Neill . The Cenel Eoghain in the next five centuries expanded to the east and south from their focal point in Inishowen. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. The McLaughlins take their name from Lochlainn, which in turn was derived from a Norse personal name, and were thus in Gaelic Mac Lochlainn, i.e. son of Lochlainn. The McLaughlins were initially the senior branch of the Northern Ui Neill and their territory was in Inishowen. In the th century the McLaughlins, ruling from their royal palace at Ailech in Inishowen, were High Kings of Ireland and patrons of the monastic settlement in Derry. Domhnall Mac Lochlainn, styled ‘King of Ireland’, died at Doire-Choluim-Chillein . After a decisive battle in  at Caimeirgethe O’Neills of Tyrone ousted the McLaughlins as the leading power in Ulster. Brian O’Neill was now ‘installed in the lordship of the Kinel-Owen’. In the th century the Dohertys ousted the McLaughlins as Lords of Inishowen. Some McLaughlins in Ulster, particularly Antrim, may derive from the Argyllshire clan known in Scotland as MacLachlan. The O’Melaghlins of north Leinster have also changed their name to McLaughlin.   - GALLAGHER  Gallagher is the third most common name in Ulster and two-thirds of the Ulster total are in the sept’s homeland of County Donegal where it is the most numerous name. Although it is only the thirteenth most common name in County Derry, it is the third most numerous in the city of Derry. This name illustrates the very close links between the city of Derry and County Donegal. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Donegal. The Gallagher sept trace their lineage to Conall Gulban, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Conall and his brother Eogan conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech in County Donegal which commanded the entrance to Inishowen between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Conall, styled ‘King of Tir Conaill’, established his own kingdom in County Donegal called after him Tyrconnel, i.e. the ‘Land of Conall’, which was the ancient name of Donegal. His descendants, known as the Cenel Conaill , formed one of the principal branches of the Northern Ui Neill . The septs of the Cenel Conaill firmly established themselves in County Donegal while those descended from Conal’s brother Eogan expanded to the east and south into Counties Derry and Tyrone. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. The Gallaghers take their name from Gallchobhair, and were thus in Gaelic O Gallchobhair, i.e. descendant of Gallagher. This name is derived from gallchobhar, meaning ‘foreign help’. The O’Gallaghers claim to be the senior and most loyal family of the Cenel Conaill. Their territory extended over a wide area in the baronies of Raphoe and Tirhugh in the east and south of County Donegal. The O’Gallaghers, from their bases at Ballybeit and Ballynaglack, were chief marshals and commanders of O’Donnell’s military forces from the th to the th centuries. The O’Gallaghers also provided many wives for the O’Donnell sept. As well as being a military family the Gallaghers have produced many churchmen. Six O’Gallaghers were bishops of Raphoe in the th and th centuries, and Redmond O Gallagher, the th century Bishop of Derry, befriended the survivors of the Spanish Armada. Today the name is found widely in Scotland where it often takes the form Gallacher. It also occurs in the English cities of Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds where it is pronounced ‘Gallocher’.   – KELLY  Kelly is the second commonest family name in Ireland, after Murphy, and part of the reason is that, at least seven and possibly as many as ten distinct septs of the same name arose in dferent parts of the country. Kelly is the sixth most common name in Ulster, and the third most numerous in Counties Derry and Tyrone. The Kelly sept of County Derry trace their lineage to Eogan, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Eogan and his brother Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech in County Donegal. Eogan, styled ‘King of Ailech’, established his own kingdom in the peninsula in County Donegal still called after him Inishowen . His descendants, known as the Cenel Eoghain , became the principal branch of the Northern Ui Neill . The Cenel Eoghain in the next five centuries expanded to the east and south from their focal point in Inishowen. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. Kelly is derived from Gaelic O Ceallaigh, the root word possibly being ceallach meaning stre. The O’Kellys were one of the leading septs of Clan Binnypossessing territory on the banks of the River Foyle near Lford in County Donegal. The first outward thrust of the Owen clan was that of Clan Binny in the th century AD who thrust southeast into County Tyrone, bypassing a hard core of resistance in County Derry of the Cianachta, as far as the river Blackwater on the borders of Tyrone and Armagh. Clan Binny eventually ousted the Oriella clans from the district lying west of the river Bann from Coleraine to beside Lough Neagh, and drove them across the river. In the course of time the O’Kellys moved eastwards into County Derry and were based in the barony of Loughinsholin in south Derry. The most powerful Kelly sept was that of Ui Maine, often called Hy Many, who ruled O’Kelly’s Country in Counties Galway and Roscommon. This sept claims descent from the th century Colla da Crioch, King of Ulster and first King of Oriel. Other O’Kelly septs originated in Counties Kilkenny, Leix, Meath, Sligo and Wicklow. Kelly was known as a surname in Scotland long before th century Irish immigration really established the name there. There was, for example, a Kelly sept attached to Clan Donald.

Established in the th and th centuries, the institutions housed women and girls who became pregnant outside marriage. About , children died in the  institutions under investigation, including two in Donegal. Taoiseach Miacutecheaacutel Martin said the report, which can be read in fullhere, described a dark, dficult and shameful chapter of Irish history. As a nation we must face up to the full truth of our past, he said. In a statement tonight, Archbishop Eamon Martin, leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland, said he accepted that the church was clearly part of that culture in which people were frequently stigmatized, judged and rejected. googletag.cmd.push “For that, and for the long-lasting hurt and emotional distress that has resulted, I unreservedly apologise to the survivors and to all those who are personally impacted by the realities it uncovers,” said the Derry man. “Mindful of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which calls us to protect le and dignity and to treat everyone – especially little children and all who are vulnerable – with love, compassion and mercy, I believe the Church must continue to acknowledge before the Lord and before others its part in sustaining what the Report describes as a “harsh … cold and uncaring atmosphere”. “Although it may be distressing, it is important that all of us spend time in the coming days reflecting on this Report which touches on the personal story and experience of many families in Ireland. googletag.cmd.push “The Commission’s Report helps to further open to the light what was for many years a hidden part of our shared history and it exposes the culture of isolation, secrecy and social ostracizing which faced “unmarried mothers” and their children in this country.” Archbishop Martin asked those in positions of leadership in the Catholic Church to study the report carefully and especially to spend time reflecting on the courageous testimonies of the witnesses to the Commission. “Together we must ask “How could this happen ” We must identy, accept and respond to the broader issues which the Report raises about our past, present and future.     “Above all we must continue to find ways of reaching out to those whose personal testimonies are central to this Report. “They have shown determination in bringing to light this dark chapter in the le of Church and society. “We owe it to them to take time to study and reflect on the findings and recommendations of the Report, and commit to doing what we can to help and support them. “The Report makes it clear that many are still learning about their personal stories and searching for family members. “The rights of all survivors to access personal information about themselves should be fully respected and I again urge the State to ensure that any remaining obstacles to information and tracing should be overcome. “The Commission believes that there may be people with further information about burial places who have not come forward. “I appeal to anyone who can help to do so.

Established in the th and th centuries, the institutions housed women and girls who became pregnant outside marriage. About , children died in the  institutions under investigation, including two in Donegal. Taoiseach Miacutecheaacutel Martin said the report, which can be read in fullhere, described a dark, dficult and shameful chapter of Irish history. As a nation we must face up to the full truth of our past, he said. In a statement tonight, Archbishop Eamon Martin, leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland, said he accepted that the church was clearly part of that culture in which people were frequently stigmatized, judged and rejected. googletag.cmd.push “For that, and for the long-lasting hurt and emotional distress that has resulted, I unreservedly apologise to the survivors and to all those who are personally impacted by the realities it uncovers,” said the Derry man. “Mindful of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which calls us to protect le and dignity and to treat everyone – especially little children and all who are vulnerable – with love, compassion and mercy, I believe the Church must continue to acknowledge before the Lord and before others its part in sustaining what the Report describes as a “harsh … cold and uncaring atmosphere”. “Although it may be distressing, it is important that all of us spend time in the coming days reflecting on this Report which touches on the personal story and experience of many families in Ireland. googletag.cmd.push “The Commission’s Report helps to further open to the light what was for many years a hidden part of our shared history and it exposes the culture of isolation, secrecy and social ostracizing which faced “unmarried mothers” and their children in this country.” Archbishop Martin asked those in positions of leadership in the Catholic Church to study the report carefully and especially to spend time reflecting on the courageous testimonies of the witnesses to the Commission. “Together we must ask “How could this happen ” We must identy, accept and respond to the broader issues which the Report raises about our past, present and future.     “Above all we must continue to find ways of reaching out to those whose personal testimonies are central to this Report. “They have shown determination in bringing to light this dark chapter in the le of Church and society. “We owe it to them to take time to study and reflect on the findings and recommendations of the Report, and commit to doing what we can to help and support them. “The Report makes it clear that many are still learning about their personal stories and searching for family members. “The rights of all survivors to access personal information about themselves should be fully respected and I again urge the State to ensure that any remaining obstacles to information and tracing should be overcome. “The Commission believes that there may be people with further information about burial places who have not come forward. “I appeal to anyone who can help to do so. All burial grounds should be identied and appropriately marked so that the deceased and their families will be recognized and never be forgotten.” Archbishop Martin said that the report spoke not only to the past, but will also have lessons for today and for future generations. “As Church, State and wider society we must ensure together that, in the Ireland of today, all children and their mothers feel wanted, welcomed and loved. “We must also continue to ask ourselves where people today might feel similarly rejected, abandoned, forgotten or pushed to the margins. “This report will stir many emotions as it further uncovers disturbing and painful truths about our past.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With City boss Declan Devine hard at work behind the scenes as he attempts to strength the squad for the coming season, he may well have to do without his current captain, who is considering leaving the club despite having one year left on his contract. Galway United are believed to be one of the clubs interested in McCormack, with boss John Caulfield eager to build a squad capable of challenging for promotion from the First Division this year. Caulfield brought McCormack to Cork City back in  and the combative midfielder was made captain at Turners Cross. He played a key part in Cork winning the league and FAI Cup double just a year later, scoring a penalty in the shoot-out victory over Dundalk at the Aviva Stadium, googletag.cmd.push Just a few months after Caulfield left the club in , McCormack also left, ing to the Brandywell for a second spell at the club. McCormack was originally brought to Derry City by Peter Hutton in mid- and spent  months, making  appearances and scoring one goal before moving to Turners Cross. He ed to the Brandywell at the end of , and was made captain by Declan Devine, seen as a direct replacement for Greg Sloggett who had joined Dundalk after just one season in red and white. The lure of European football was a big factor in McCormack ing, but it ultimately proved to be a disappointing season with City knocked out of the Europa League at the first time of asking by Lithuanian side FK Riteriai. googletag.cmd.push Domestically, City also struggled, as they travelled to Cork City on the final day of the season needing a point to ensure their Premier Division status. The point from that - draw saw the Candystripes finish in seventh place. In a season which Covid- affected football across the world, City were also badly hit, with two outbreaks at the Brandywell, bringing a disruptive inconsistency to games in the final two months of the season. Despite the upheaval, McCormack was an ever-present in the City side, featuring in  of  games in all competitions, again scoring one goal. McCormack’s last act as City captain could well have been his missed penalty in the FAI Cup quarterfinal loss at Sligo Rovers, after which he admitted that it had been a dficult year for everyone involved.     “It has been horrible,” he said. “There’s no way of dressing it up. It has been very dficult for players. “It’s been a very dficult season for us, especially there the last few weeks. We were locked up for two weeks then played two games over  hours without having been able to prepare properly. “Then we went into another two weeks lockdown and didn’t have time to prepare properly for Sligo which was a really winnable game. “We didn’t get off to the best start. We got a bit of momentum and then there was the shutdown. We didn’t start well after the break and found ourselves in a dficult situation. “We pulled it out of the bag with another couple of wins and were shut down again, so it was very hard to build momentum or team morale. There were no team bonding sessions as we were all separated away from the training area.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We want to be able to develop our coaching set-up, particularly in urban centres like Downpatrick, Newry, north Down, the Down parts of Belfast. Hopefully those opportunities will come up.Mr McAteer said the implementation of a Down training hub at Ballykinlar was a key aim when it comes to considering where spending will take place in Down GAA.ldquoThe development at Ballykinlar is a huge thing, both for Down and the community in Ballykinlar. That is one of the key fronts we are working on, he said.ldquoOf course though, we cannot take our eye of the importance of development in urban areas.

We can also explore the possibility of greater cross-border development with counties like Louth, and the use of the Dublin Institute of Technology. There is, going forward this year, a lot of potential for imaginative funding that we can use to our advantage here in Down.Another cornerstone of the approach to keeping Down GAA in good health is continuing to appeal to the younger generations coming through in the Mourne county.ldquoWe need to try to make Gaelic Games the number one sport of choice for young kids in Down, Mr McAteer said.ldquoIf you look at our record from July of  to the end of the year, we staged , games. A lot of those games were at an under-age level. Some clubs have got very very strong groups of kids at very young ages.ldquoWhat we need to do is to ensure that those young people who come into the GAA in Down at that stage stay with it into adulthood.ldquoOur games need to be attractive and innovative going forward.ldquoThat means we all need to keep pushing, keep the facilities as good as possible and promoting ourselves as well as we can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Brexit deal is ‘best of both worlds’ for local fishermen  ","story":"THE Brexit fisheries deal with the European Union is good news for the Ardglass fishing industry.Thatrsquos the view of former fishermenrsquos leader Dick James, who says Ardglass and the other Co Down fishing ports can look to the future with confidence.Mr James, former chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, says an increase in quotas for key catches will benefit fishermen.At the same time the non-imposition of tarfs on exported fish to EU markets, will underpin the future of the processing industry.Mr James that while some areas of the UK had done badly from the Brexit deal, local fishermen should be pleased with the outcome.ldquoThe deal is good news for our fishermen and should secure investment and new jobs in the industry, he said.In the Irish Sea the amount of herring which can be caught by UK fishermen will rise from the current figure of % to % in  and % in .In the crucial prawn sector, the UK quota for Area , which includes the Irish Sea, will go from % currently to % in  and % in .There will also be increases in the UK quotas for other types of fish, including haddock, cod and whiting.Mr James said: ldquoWe have got the best of both worlds.

Cryptosporidium bug outbreak at the Silent Valley reservoir is specically linked to sheep grazing or to all animals grazing in the area.Mr Frank McDowell said he has asked the Department of Agriculture and Rural Developmenttesting will be carried out to establish the reasons for the grazing ban at Silent Valley andit is confined only to the grazing of sheep.Pointing out that it would

sustained by the use of sheep grazing.ldquoSinn Fein has asked DARD officialsthere is flexibility in the case of Silent Valley in order to safeguard future area aid payments, he explained.ldquoThe

Scottish Cup on Sunday.The -year old saved two spot-kicks against Championship side Hearts as the nine-in-a-row Scottish champions clinched an historic quadruple treble. The enthralling cup tie ended - after  minutes with the sides locked at - after extra-time at Hampden Park.Hazard, who was recently handed the number one jersey by Hoops boss Neil Lennon, made both his European and Scottish Premiership debuts and retained the starting jersey for Sundayrsquos final.The stopper mdash who has also forced his way into the Northern Ireland international squad mdash was delighted to play a major part in his sidersquos cup final victory.And while his current contract expires in the summer which allows him to negotiate with other clubs in January, should he favour a move away from Celtic Park, leaving the club he has supported since he was a boy is the last thing on his mind.Conor described Sundayrsquos cup final as ldquocrazy day for him and his family who watched the match at home.ldquoThree weeks ago, I would never have been able to picture what happened there on that pitch, he said moments after his penalty shoot-out heroics.ldquoI am just absolutely over the moon. Irsquove been a Celtic fan my whole le and to get this opportunity, well I am just delighted, he said.ldquoTo play for such a worldwide club, we know what the fans expect and how much they drive us towards winning. It is an honour to play for them. I want to fully focus on each match, playing week in, week out here at Celtic, and hopefully it will come together.Conor said the final was a ldquomomentous day for him and his family, explaining that his lsquophone hasnrsquot stopped ringing.Conor grew up in Downpatrick and developed his skills in the Celtic academy, travelling across to Scotland for games from a young age.ldquoThe club means everything to me, he said. ldquoWe used to get up at am to get on the boat to go to matches and we wouldnrsquot be home until three the next morning. Itrsquos something I always dreamed of growing up.Conor has spent several spells out on loan in recent years in order to build-up his first team experience, readying him for a career between the sticks for Celtic.He got his chance to impress against Lille and Kilmarnock r as Celticrsquos form hit a rocky patch, but being selected by Lennon for the win over Hearts at Hampden Park was a huge confidence boost.ldquoI have to thank all of the staff and the manager for putting trust in me, said Conor.ldquoIt was a huge honour in such a big game. Thankfully, I was able to repay that trust with the two penalty saves. I have put a lot of work in and gone on loan spells waiting for my chance. The coaches have helped me a lot throughout the club.Sundayrsquos cup win clinched the domestic treble for Celtic for the fourth successive campaign, something that has never before been achieved. It is also the th time Celtic have been crowned Scottish Cup winners, with the Downpatrick man admitting the team has a lot of work to do to try and achieve its aims and targets this year.ldquoThe final was only my third game for the club, so Irsquom taking each day as it comes. As a team and as a group, this win could be a major factor in turning things round, he added.Conorrsquos family watched his cup final heroics at home in Downpatrick as fans were not allowed to attend the match due to coronavirus restrictions. However, they were over the moon with his achievements.ldquoI donrsquot think I have any fingernails left after that, laughed his beaming dad Gary. ldquoWe didnrsquot know up until the last minutehe would get the nod to play or not. We knew he did well in the European game and certainly made a case for himself. He only found out on Thursday from Lennon that he would be playing.Whilst there was undoubted pride from his dad, Gary said Conor has deserved his break due to how hard he has worked.ldquoHe has put so much time into Celtic over the years and done all the right things. All the close family are so proud of him, his mum Pauline, his younger brother Jack. He was superb.ldquoConor very much wants to be able to go on and make himself number one for Celtic. He is only  and this was just his third appearance, so hersquos been doing well. He had a loan spell at Dundee and did very well there and that has put him in good stead.Gary said Conor has also been drawing high praise from his Northern Ireland manager Ian Barraclough after breaking through for the senior team too.ldquoBarraclough has spoken really highly of Conor. He did very well for him when he was the manager at under-age level and the boss knows what he can do in training, he said.Conorrsquos family are no strangers to sporting success either.

Some churches are already helping out along these lines.For instance, Greenisland Parish Church in east Antrim is allowing its church hall to be used as a vaccine centre .l The News Letter’s ‘A Shot in the Arm’ campaign is pressing for NI’s network of about  pharmacies to be used as part of a drive to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible.:Click here: Serious winter flu cases virtually wiped out in Northern IrelandA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

He writes: “The polling industry is generally grappling with how to reach less politically-engaged registered voters in an era where people are less likely to answer their landline or own one at all.” He adds: “But the general problem of pollsters reaching too few non-voters is colliding here with a Northern Irish peculiarity. Non-voters here are not apathetic, the evidence suggests, they are just turned off by orange-green politics. In the Northern Ireland parlance, the non-voters are Neithers.”Mr Leroux cites a University of Liverpool review into the  general election. “Pro-Union non-voters outnumbered pro-united Ireland non-voters by more than three to one. They are unionists too embarrassed by unionism to vote for a unionist party or, for the most part, to identy as unionists.” He says that “another source of authoritative data, the Northern Ireland Le  Times series ... found a strong majority of Neithers have backed remaining in the UK”. This, Mr Leroux speculates, has distorted some polls so as to exaggerate support for a united Ireland.• Morning View, page   Report page ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local community\"The increasing numbers of Covid- case numbers across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan Health Board area could not be any more serious or alarming.Therefore, this message needs to be acted upon urgently and be seen as a warning to each and every one of us about the seriousness of the health situation we are all now facing.If current projections continue, then by Christmas week we will be seeing more than four times the number of new infections each day, than we were seeing at the start of December. These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need.ldquoIn the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit.

Not just from the virus but the isolation our response to it creates.So the Penarth Times will publish, online and in print, a list of support services - public organisations, charities, community groups and local volunteers - who are there to help in whatever way through this dficult time.And we are asking you to play your part by doing three things.First,you know an organisation or group that should be on our list, let us know and well add them so more people can benefit.If you know of a group doing good in your community, tell us so we can share their story and provide hope and inspiration.And, most importantly, think about who the people are in your community who you might be able to help, be it a card through the door or dropping off some shopping. In short, look out for each other.More NewsSecond coronavirus vaccine approved for use in the UKPenarth nativity delights audiences despite lockdown challengesFigures on police use of force and tasers on childrenThe campaign has been welcomed by Vale of Glamorgan Senedd member Jane Hutt said: \"The Penarth Times has continued to serve our community throughout the pandemic and I am pleased to support its Were in it Together campaign.\"Teams of volunteers, including family, friends and neighbours, have directly supported vulnerable members of our local community and I am pleased that the Penarth Times is highlighting these efforts and sharing offers of support.\"You can take share your suggestions or stories by emailing us at penarthtimes@penarthtimes or calling  .You can share ideas on social media too using #InItTogether. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAfter a major incident was declared in the capital last Friday due to rising Covid- cases, Mr Khan and London Councils chair Georgia Gould have written to the Prime Minister calling for measures similar to those in place last March and April.Aside from the closure of places of worship, they have called for the PM to make mask-wearing mandatory outside the home ndash including in supermarket queues, on high streets and in other possibly crowded outdoor settings.Also among four major demands is for the Government to provide greater financial support for Londoners who need to self-isolate and are unable to work, backed by improved asymptomatic testing for key workers.The two leaders also called for the the rollout of vaccines across London to be accelerated, and for the provision of daily vaccination data by borough and ethnicity.ldquoWe recognise how dficult these decisions are and how they will impose further tough restrictions on Londoners, the letter says. ldquoWith new levels of infection remaining high we are left with little choice but to ask that you implement them.Mr Khan and Ms Gould said places of worship were ldquocrucially important for communities and that ldquowe wouldnrsquot be making this requestthe situation wasnrsquot very serious. vw,vw,px, px\"Sadiq Khan and London Councils say tougher measures are needed urgently as the capital strains under the pandemic The letter also urges four other more temporary measures: an urgent review of what constitutes essential and non-essential retail, stricter guidance on how retailers can prevent unsafe queues and crowding, prohibiting click and collect services at non-essential retail chains, and stronger guidance on size restrictions for weddings, funerals and similar gatherings.ldquoThe measures we are asking for would need to be kept under regular review, butthey are not introduced as a matter of urgency then we fear that the transmission of the virus will continue to spread across the capital, putting unsustainable strain on our NHS and public services, the letter says.While pledging to support the vaccination rollout, the two leaders urged Mr Johnson to review the distribution formula. They said current plans would leave London and other major cities ldquowith fewer vaccines per head of population compared to less densely populated regions. vw,vw,px, px\"London Councils chair Georgia Gould has teamed with London Mayor Sadiq Khan to call for a review of the formula for the national rollout of the coronavirus vaccine, among other urgent demands ldquoCurrently each Primary Care Networkin England is receiving an equal distribution of vaccines, despite the huge iations in the size of the populations PCNs serve. We call on you to review this formula and urgently scale up vaccine distribution in London, the letter says.While conceding immunising the first four cohorts on the Governmentrsquos vaccination priority list ldquoshould bring down the mortality rate over the next few weeks and months, Mr Khan and Ms Gould expressed frustration that it was currently not possible to roll out the vaccine to the next five, mostly younger, cohorts.ldquoIt is these younger groups, the  to  year olds, that are presenting at hospitals in large numbers, the two leaders said. vw,vw,px, px\"Covid- patients in hospital in England.

Some churches are already helping out along these lines.For instance, Greenisland Parish Church in east Antrim is allowing its church hall to be used as a vaccine centre .l The News Letter’s ‘A Shot in the Arm’ campaign is pressing for NI’s network of about  pharmacies to be used as part of a drive to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible.:Click here: Serious winter flu cases virtually wiped out in Northern IrelandA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
