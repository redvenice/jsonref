Everyone is jostling for position and attention, and they\u0027re bouncing off the walls after four days. It\u0027s like a pinball machine.\u0027They all want to please the Queen and want airtime with her, it\u0027s the one time that they can sit down with the head of the family and make an impression.\u0027It\u0027s what I said to Diana when she first came into the family, try to get airtime with the Queen, speak into her ear. \u0027The best time to do it is when she\u0027s seated at her card table, before and after dinner, she will sit and play Bridge or Canasta and she\u0027ll always ask people to join her, that\u0027s your chance to get quality time and tell the monarch what you\u0027re thinking and feeling.\u0027That\u0027s the time Meghan should grasp, don\u0027t be talking dresses and jewels with other royals, head for the Queen. The Queen is the most humble, approachable and kind person you\u0027ll ever meet, she\u0027s a great listener, nothing will shock her, she\u0027s heard everything, and you can tell her everything, and it will be safe.\u0027The Queen has to be informed from the horse\u0027s mouth, if you don\u0027t do that, you\u0027re doing an injustice, I hope that Meghan will get this advice from Harry, that granny knows best. \u0027If you speak your fears, she will take it onboard and speak to the right person.

Would I be prepared to do an unpaid gig to raise money for the school\u0027s Unicef charity, he asked.I was happy to help. And yet here, just a few weeks later, I was told what kind of jokes I was allowed to make.Of course, the list itself is a laughable pastiche of today\u0027s politically correct times. But it is also deeply concerning — especially for someone like me, who was born in the Soviet Union, the home of Stalinist purges, the KGB, gulag prison camps and just about the last place on Earth you would readily associate with freedom of speech.And yet here I was in London, the capital of a country still seen as the birthplace of democracy and as a bastion of tolerance and free speech, being told what I could and couldn\u0027t say at an event being hosted at a leading university. It\u0027s extraordinary.          Mr Kisin was sent a \u0027behavioural agreement form\u0027 which stopped him telling jokes which were not \u0027respectful and kind\u0027My family know all about political repression and the denial of free speech. I came to Britain to stay with my grandfather, who decades earlier  had dared to speak out against the government.Back then, saying \u0027the wrong thing\u0027 had serious repercussions. He was reported to the KGB and was forced into exile.When he arrived in England, he was enthralled by the prospect of living in a land where citizens were free to speak their minds. It was the absence of \u0027behavioural agreement forms\u0027 that he celebrated.Support for freedom of speech clearly runs in our family: my grandmother was born in a gulag prison camp, where her parents had been sent for — you guessed it — also saying \u0027the wrong thing\u0027.Decades later, with the Russian Federation now in place of the Soviet Union, the country is still a tough place for jokes.Just this year, Armando Iannucci\u0027s brilliant political satire, The Death Of Stalin, was banned for being \u0027insulting\u0027 and containing aspects of \u0027ideological warfare\u0027. Presumably, if it had been \u0027respectful and kind\u0027 about a despot responsible for possibly 20 million deaths, it would have been packing out Russian cinemas.Here in my adopted homeland I co-host a podcast, TRIGGERnometry, in which myself and another comedian, Francis Foster, discuss controversial subjects with a range of guests. If I did that in Russia, our only listeners would be the KGB.Ideological oppression is exactly what I hoped I had escaped by coming here. But as that \u0027behavioural agreement form\u0027 showed, I was wrong.Not that I was particularly surprised. For as we have seen, Britain\u0027s conviction in freedom of expression is waning.And its decline is most obvious at our universities, where barely a week goes by without news of someone being \u0027no-platformed\u0027 — having their invitation to speak suddenly withdrawn by outraged students frothing at the mouth about some perceived slight or other.At Oxford University recently, students demonstrated their unrivalled capacity for feeling offended by demanding a college remove a portrait of alumna (and Prime Minister) Theresa May. Apparently, her views were too \u0027contentious\u0027 for Britain\u0027s best and brightest.At Kent University at the start of this term, student officials proposed a ban on dressing up as cowboys and vicars because, rather than being a laugh, it was deemed beyond the pale. (For some reason I also have an invitation from Kent University sitting in my inbox ...)Critics blame the over-sensitivity of molly-coddled millennials, the so-called snowflake generation, for all this. Others suggest it is simply political correctness gone mad. (Even the comedy legend John Cleese was kind enough yesterday to salute the stand I have taken.)But I believe it is more sinister than that.For decades, British universities have provided a safe and relatively well-paid haven for radical Left-wing intellectuals who are now passing on their wacky opinions to an increasingly spoon-fed generation. It\u0027s representatives of that generation who sent me the ridiculous behavioural agreement form.When I went to Edinburgh University 15 years ago, I wanted to learn and, more importantly, how to think for myself.A key part of that process is knowing that it is a good thing to have our opinions challenged from time to time by those who hold differing views. And that\u0027s where telling a joke is useful. For nothing is capable of challenging orthodoxy quite like humour.My working life is comedy. I like making people laugh and would have loved to have done so at SOAS. After all, today\u0027s students are in desperate need of a good laugh.          A spokesman for SOAS student union (pictured) said it \u0027does not require external speakers to sign any form of contract or behavioural agreement\u0027But if comedians give in to the prescriptive whims of this minority of intolerant and humourless British student officials, they will become the intolerant and humourless opinion-formers of tomorrow — not just the speechwriters, advisers and politicians, but the police officers, judges and journalists, too.There is a glimmer of a hope that this country\u0027s centuries-old commitment to free speech will prevail.Soon after I went public with this ridiculous invitation, I was asked to perform at Comedy Unleashed, a new comedy club set up in London to discourage self-censorship and promote freedom of expression.I read out the behavioural agreement form and got a few nice laughs.

But sentencing was delayed for a year, after Kiseliova unsuccessfully tried to withdraw her guilty plea.    Some of the dogs, which included French and English bulldogs, were found trapped locked in cagesThe pair fled the country, where they are believed to be hiding in Eastern Europe. An European Arrest Warrant has been issued.At Manchester Crown Court Kiseliova was sentenced to four years jail and Titas got three and a half years imprisonment. They will be ordered to serve half their sentences once they are located.Sentencing the pair in their absence, Judge Richard Mansell QC said: \u0027These offences arose out of the running of the company Pets313 from your home address from December 2012. Two puppy traffickers who made £300,000 selling designer...Germans can choose a THIRD gender - allowing people to be...Share this article\u0027During that period 729 animals, 341 dogs and 388 cats, were in receipt of a Pet Plan which came with free insurance for 28 days.\u0027They travelled from Europe into the UK frequently and you abused the Pet Passport scheme which states the pets have been examined by vets and vaccinated before travelling to reduce the risk of diseases such as rabies.\u0027The majority of the dogs came from Eastern European countries such as Hungary, Belarus and Poland and you had people who would bring the dogs back in multiples of up to five at once.\u0027You detected customers and mislead them by making false representations to tell them the business had been approved by the Kennel Club.  The RSPCA said they found \u0027cages and pens containing different breeds of dogs in almost every room\u0027 when they raided the couple\u0027s home\u0027Many customers made purchases of sums from £100 to £1,000, and the dogs they purchased had health problems from the moment they got home.\u0027On December 12th, Jason Marshall bought his wife a pug for Christmas, he paid you £800 for that pug, which he named Coco.\u0027He was told he received vaccinations and was cared for by way of the Puppy pack. But Coco became ill and was taken to the local vets where she was examined and it was revealed she had lung problems, problems with her hips and she had to have a hernia removed.\u0027He said he wished he never had purchased her from you because she was so ill when he bought her.\u0027Gemma Walker bought a French bulldog from you called Bella. You met her before the purchase and showed her a pet pack which stated she had been to the vets, she left and paid £720.\u0027She asked for further medical notes, to which you asked for £500 extra payment for them.          The charity said a number of animals, including these cats, left and right, needed urgent veterinary treatment\u0027When she was taken home Miss Walker realised she wasn\u0027t breathing properly and called you, to which you told her that the dog wasn\u0027t your problem anymore.\u0027Taking Bella to the vet, Miss Walker was told the tablets she was giving her dog, prescribed by you, were for humans and once analysis was undertaken of the microchip, they discovered the dog was from Denmark and had a number of physical health problems.\u0027Miss Walker was back and forth to the vet numerous times and paid over £4,500 in vets bills.\u0027When the RSPCA came to your address they discovered animals kept in cages with little stimulation for space to run around. Two bulldogs that were rescued unfortunately died within a few days because they were in such ill health.\u0027No dogs with infections were kept in isolation, and hence this made other dogs infected. Puppies were kept in cages in the bedroom upstairs and some were kept in crates in the garage.\u0027The treatment of those animals was nothing short of appalling. They put their desire and greed before the welfare of animals.          Customers reported the dogs\u0027 health rapidly deteriorated after they were taken home - having been kept in squalid, cramped conditions since birth\u0027This was sophisticated offending which you involved others in and was over a substantial period of time. They made just over £300,000.\u0027They were driven solely by your greed. The conditions the animals were kept in were appalling, keeping them in crowded cages. Many were in pain and your treatment of them was utterly shameful.\u0027Speaking on behalf of Titas, his lawyer Stella Massey said: \u0027It does not bode well that Mr Titas is not here. I have met Mr Titas before.\u0027He did not come to the UK with the intention of finding himself in the position he was when he was arrested. He was working as a mechanic, working 12 hour days. He wasn\u0027t manipulated at court. He was the director of the company, but it was not his idea to set up the company.\u0027It was the co defendant who met with the customers and set up the website. He was directed by her when they needed taking to the vets or feeding. He had long term employment as a mechanic.\u0027He was working long hours six days a week, he was working towards his level three qualifications in mechanics. He comes from a stable and supportive background.\u0027A lifetime order under the Animal Welfare Act was placed on them, disqualifying them frown owning or looking after animals.Speaking after the case, the investigating officer for Trading Standards, Mr Gareth Hollinsworth, said: \u0027We received intelligence that animals were being sold illegally at an address in Salford in January 2013.\u0027We went to the address and met with the female defendant. She said she was acting as an interpreter for the male defendant but was giving more information that was the male was.\u0027We left the address and began receiving more intelligence and complaints which linked back to the address, so we contacted the RSPCA.\u0027We found evidence of animals in the property and we arrested them. Now there is a European arrest warrant out for them and it\u0027s out of our hands unfortunately.\u0027She is the most calculating and manipulative person I\u0027ve met. People went to her house and she knew she was going to sell them something.\u0027People bought an animals thinking they were rescuing them, but they weren\u0027t.\u0027We want to send out a message to people who are thinking of buying a pet this Christmas, it\u0027s a choice that you must keep for many years. Don\u0027t click and collect.\u0027Please do your research. Make sure the buyer is regulated with the local authority. Make sure you know which animal you are getting. It\u0027s vital for the health and safety of that pet.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"CBB star Chloe Ayling claims shes vulnerable attend kidnapper trial","story":"    Chloe Ayling has been mocked for claiming she is too \u0027vulnerable\u0027 to attend a trial because she has been sharing snaps of her all over the world such as this one in the Males          \u0027Worried\u0027: Miss Ayling, 21, shared this snap of her in Hollywood, California in October          Alleged kidnapper: Michal Konrad Herba, 36, (centre) is accused of helping kidnap Miss Ayling          Chloe Ayling was spotted with new boyfriend Lewis G from Big Brother on their first date skating at Winter Wonderland this weekHerba\u0027s lawyer Simone Zancani has demanded she attend, saying she needs to be questioned on her story because it \u0027doesn\u0027t add up,\u0027 reported The Sun.He told the hearing in Milan: \u0027We find it quite hard to believe Ms Ayling says she cannot come to Milan because she is vulnerable. \u0027It appears she is happy to travel thousands of miles across the world to the west coast of America, to Thailand and to other places for photoshoots.Share this article\u0027You just have to look at her Instagram to see that she is not afraid of travelling to various places across the world and pose in her swimwear for glamorous publicity campaigns.\u0027Mr Zancani said it was only fair that Miss Ayling, who appeared on Celebrity Big Brother this year, be cross-examined in person. Judges will decide if she must attend or can appear via video link next month. The trial continues.   On Tuesday, Miss Alying\u0027s kidnapper Lukasz Herba, 30, was handed a 17-year jail sentence.

She was drugged with ketamine, stripped and handcuffed before being bundled into a suitcase in the boot of a car.Lukasz, who is Polish, then drove her for five hours to a remote farmhouse in Borgial, near Turin, where she was held hostage for six days.The former DHL delivery driver sent an email to Miss Ayling\u0027s agent Philip Green, saying: \u0027I am mid-level hitman with Black Death. She has been taken by our group and will be sold by our group to Middle Eastern buyers.\u0027He sent another email claiming that Black Death - a shadowy online trafficking network - would auction her for around £300,000.

Christmas wish: finally decide what you really want and Santa will deliver,\u0027 she said on Twitter in posting a picture of a chocolate Christmas tree.As she arrived at the summit, Mrs May publicly conceded for the first time that the Brexit crisis will cut short her stay in Downing Street, saying although in her \u0027heart\u0027 she wants to fight on, she will need to quit before the next general election.\u0027I think it is right that the party feels that it would prefer to go into that election with a new leader,\u0027 she said.   Mrs Merkel today again flatly dismissed the prospect of renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement, while the Finnish PM warned the best she can hope for is \u0027political\u0027 assurances. \u0027We can discuss whether there should be additional assurances, but here the 27 member states will act very much in common and make their interests very clear.\u0027This is always in the spirit that we will have very, very good relations with the UK after it has departed from the European Union.\u0027 French president Emmanuel Macron said there could be a \u0027political discussion\u0027 but added ominously: \u0027One cannot reopen a legal agreement.\u0027  Mr Rutte was effusive in his praise of Mrs May\u0027s \u0027tenacity\u0027. \u0027I feel respect. She is an able leader. I admire her tenacity and resilience. She\u0027s a great leader. And if you saw the Labour people laughing at her when she said \u0027I listened\u0027, I felt this was not very British,\u0027 he said.\u0027She stood there and kept her composure and won this fight within her party. I have the highest admiration for her.\u0027Finnish PM Juha Sipila warned: \u0027Legally binding will be a little bit difficult.\u0027But we all want to help her first of all, and then our goal is that the new relationship will be before the backstop.\u0027So I think, at the political level, we can (offer assurances). That\u0027s our primary goal. And let\u0027s see if we can find something from the legal side also, but it\u0027s open still.\u0027  A Commons vote on the PM\u0027s Brexit deal was pulled at the last moment this week to avoid a catastrophic defeat. Trade Secretary Liam Fox has put down a clear marker by warning it may never be put to a Parliamentary vote unless changes are made. In a sign of the simmering isions, other ministers including Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark are urging an early vote on the package - and then if it is defeated a series of Commons votes on different options for how to move forward.  Mrs May also played down hopes of any shift soon, saying: \u0027I don\u0027t expect an immediate breakthrough, but what I do hope is that we can start to work as quickly as possible on the assurances that are necessary.\u0027             Railway Children serenades commuters in London station with flash mobMay and Juncker have very animated discussion at European CouncilBritish couple reunited with lost engagement ring on Ellen ShowDrama as Georgia Steel is reunited with ex Sam on Love IslandCCTV footage shows Jamelia\u0027s stepbrother in revenge shooting\u0027I\u0027m still struggling\u0027: Jessica Starr a month ago on her eye surgeryMum claims toddler captured grandad speaking from beyond the graveRailway Children charity bursts into song in London Bridge StationRoad blocked at Tower Bridge during \u0027yellow vest\u0027 protestSubway rider Anna Lushchinskaya starts fight with another passengerEight-year-old takes the wheel after mum has a seizure while driving  \u0027Me hoping nobody asks me what Nebulous means #IHaveNoIdea\u0027: Baffled Twitter users rush to look up the meaning behind Jean-Claude Juncker\u0027s jibe at Theresa May Theresa May looked angry today following tense meetings with fellow EU leaders after she accused Commission President Jean-Claude Junker of calling her nebulous. Twitter users rejoiced after lip readers reported the cutting barb allegedly used by Mr Junker to describe Mrs May\u0027s Brexit demands. Mrs May, who regularly prefaces her statements with the words \u0027let me be clear\u0027, was offended by suggestions that he was hazy and imprecise when ventilating her Brexit strategy.             Theresa May was clearly annoyed when she confronted European Commission president Jean-Claude Junker, pictured, during a meeting in Brussels earlier today over suggestions the former Luxembourg PM described Mrs May as \u0027nebulous\u0027      Twitter today exploded over allegations the EU Commission President Dean Claude Junker described Theresa May as acting in a nebulous manner. Mrs Junker strongly denied the claims during a meeting in Brussels eariler otoday    Social media fans decided to have some fun this afternoon at Mrs May\u0027s expense.             Theresa May was in Brussels to meet EU leader in the hope they would alter the Withdrawal agreement she had previously agreed with them as it is unlikely she will have enough support to push it through Westminster    One Twitter user claimed it was the best insult since Kim Jong-un described US president Donald Trump, while a second person suggested the word could be used as a playground insult by enterprising bullies next weekThe PM - wielding her handbag - was seen locked in an extraordinary standoff with the EU commission chief on the second day of a tense gathering in Brussels.Although the sound was switched off, TV cameras caught the pair exchanging heated words for at least a minute. According to lipreaders, Mrs May took the Eurocrat to task for comments he delivered to journalists in the early hours of this morning, saying: \u0027You called me nebulous. Yes you did!\u0027Mr Juncker, who had one hand on Mrs May\u0027s arm, looked to be trying to soothe her anger by denying making the jibe. But body language experts said Mrs May successfully disrupted Mr Juncker\u0027s usual \u0027Godfather\u0027 demeanour and put him on the back foot.            Some Twitter users admitted the former Luxembourg\u0027s knowledge of the English language exceeded their own            However, some clearly had an understanding as to the meaning of the word with this Tellytubby-esque effort     Some Twitter users - even Larry the Downing Street cat - picked up on the scandal, while others suggested the use of the word Neubulous was one of the kinder descriptions used to define the PM    Twitter users were very critical of Mrs May\u0027s handling of the Brexit process suggesting the use of nebulous is justified             Pro Brexit supporters have been surprised by the unit of the European Union in keeping a coherent message during talksThe clash could garner Mrs May some much needed points with Tory Eurosceptics and the DUP at home, as she struggles to find a way through the Parliamentary impasse over Brexit. They have been urging her to show she won\u0027t \u0027roll over\u0027 as the EU turns up the heat by dismissing calls for \u0027legally binding\u0027 guarantees that the UK will not be stuck in the Irish border \u0027backstop\u0027 for ever. In a press conference late last night - and wearing a green tie in solidarity with Ireland - Mr Juncker said: \u0027It is the UK leaving the EU. Our UK friends need to say what they want, instead of asking us to say what we want. I find it uncomfortable.\u0027   \u0027So we would like, within a few weeks, our UK friends to set out their expectations for us because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise and I would like clarifications.\u0027            One Liverpool fan admitted that Jean-Claude Junker may have increased his knowledge of the English language today            It is unlikely Theresa May will be raising a glass tonight like Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous, played by Joanna Lumley            Someone decided to dig out the meme of Guy Goma, a cab driver accidentally interviewed on BBC News             Google showed that searches for nebulous have rocketed as a result of the heated row in Brussels             The Prime Minister hoped that European leaders would provide her with a lifeline and did not expect a hostile reception            The European Union has ruled out re-opening the withdrawal agreement with the UK             Theresa May\u0027s domestic critics have slammed the PM for her failure to change the terms of her withdrawal agreement Theresa May\u0027s Brexit tour ends in humiliation as top Tories claim 48 letters are in - Mirror OnlineLIVE: May \u0027offers backstop workaround\u0027 at EU summit"},{"url":null,"title":"Tony Blair insists new Brexit referendum","story":"    Tony Blair (pictured today making a People\u0027s Vote speech) insisted there must be a second referendum on Brexit because of the \u0027crisis\u0027 over Theresa May\u0027s dealMr Blair said: \u0027We have had 30 months of negotiation.

Mr Blair made a new speech setting out the case for a referendum today - urging Theresa May (pictured today in Brussels) to admit Parliament had \u0027taken the initiative\u0027 and must not lead the process.He told the Today programme:  \u0027Let\u0027s be clear, in the last 30 months the European politics has been transformed.\u0027Asked if he specifically meant free movement, Mr Blair said: \u0027Well, I think yes, absolutely. And if you take freedom of movement and the question of immigration, this is an issue all over the European politics today.\u0027So yes, I think it would be sensible and right if Europe also responded if Britain said \u0027\u0027look we are prepared to think again\u0027\u0027.\u0027Europe should step forward with a series of measures that would allow people in Britain to understand and be listened to and frankly people all over Europe to feel they\u0027ve been listened to.\u0027Mr Blair said Parliament would end up backing a referendum because \u0027no other option of Brexit works\u0027.He said: \u0027The real reason we should have another referendum is that we have had 30 months of negotiation and let\u0027s be clear, we are in crisis mode on this.\u0027    Mr Blair said Parliament (pictured this week during PMQs) would end up backing a referendum because \u0027no other option of Brexit works\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/13/21/7398176-0-image-a-16_1544735090094.jpg","title":"Dating apps topless Santa advert taken objectifying male model","story":"    The advert by Lumen was ruled as \u0027objectifying\u0027 the male model in the advert  Exterion Media, Transport for London\u0027s advertising firm, said the caption must be changed to something \u0027less suggestive\u0027 and the model must be covered up.

Chappell who had no retail experience, bought BHS from billionaire Sir Philip Green for just £1 in March 2015. The company crashed just 13 months later with stores including this branch in Newport, Wales, closing          Green pictured on board one of his yachts in Miami in December last yearHe said: \u0027I\u0027m the victim of circumstances that came out of British Home Stores. I wish to God we had never got involved in it.\u0027Chappell who had no retail experience, bought BHS from billionaire Sir Philip Green for just £1 in March 2015.The 88-year-old company crashed just 13 months later in April 2016 with the loss of 11,000 jobs and 164 stores, leaving a pensions black hole of more than £500million.The Regulator, which has a responsibility to safeguard pensions, moved to protect the pensions of 19,000 members.Between May 2016 - August 2017 the Regulator and made three Section 72 requests for documents relating got the pension scheme from the new owner, Chappell.It later agreed a deal with Sir Philip Green that he should pay £363million towards the pension deficit.When Chappell failed to comply he was charged with three counts of neglecting or refusing to provide documents contrary to the Pensions Act 2004 and after a trial in January he was found guilty and £50,000 with court costs of £37,000.The self-described entrepreneur took his case to appeal and lost and today was hauled before the courts for re-sentence.Representing himself at Hove Crown Court, claiming he could not afford a barrister or solicitor, he said he had very few assets or business interests and had been forced to rent a car to get to the hearing from his home in Blandford Forum, Dorset.He said: \u0027I\u0027m not Philip Green sitting on a £100m yacht in the south fo France who just wrote a cheque for £350m to make the problem go away.          But in court today Chappell launched a strongly-worded broadside against the Arcadia boss. He said that unlike Sir Philip Green (pictured) he wasn\u0027t a billionaire who could wave his chequebook at the problemHe said during his 13-months at the helm of BHS he had contributed £4.5million to the pension fund and had helped the Regulator recoup the £350million that Sir Philip Green took from the fund.He said: \u0027I have not been convicted of any wrongdoing at BHS apart from the Section 72s. We did the best job available in the time we had. I tried everything I could to get information for them.\u0027The entrepreneur said he had exhausted his savings and now relied on a wage from his current employer but added that he was unlikely to receive a £4,000 predicted Christmas bonus due to poor trading conditions.Chappell added: \u0027I\u0027ve been worn out. I cannot play this game anymore. I can\u0027t afford to do so.\u0027In deciding the level of the fine the court took into account his present financial circumstances and commitments.Chappell denied he had a stake in a yacht called Maverick II or a flat in Marbella which he said had belonged to his mother but had been sold.Judge Christine Henson QC said evidence put forward by Chappell was \u0027untrue\u0027 and not \u0027credible\u0027.She said: \u0027The culpability was high, it was deliberate, it was persistent. In terms of harm we found that his refusal to comply caused significant delays to TPR task. \u0027It made their task significantly more difficult. It must have cause them stress and anguish. It undermined the proper function of the Regulator.\u0027Nicola Parish for TPR said: \u0027Dominic Chappell has consistently refused to provide the information about the sale of BHS that we demanded, despite the courts being clear he should provide it.\u0027His repeated claims that he does not have to give us what we had been seeking have now been rejected by two different courts.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"MPs hopes quiet Christmas run dashed","story":"    Chief Whip Julian Smith (pictured in Downing Street on Monday) has written to the party\u0027s MPs telling them they must not leave Westminster until Wednesday night because of concerns about \u0027opposition tactics\u0027They told the Mail: \u0027Some of our MPs had been planning an early getaway because they thought it would be quiet in the Commons, but now they have been forced to cancel their holiday plans.\u0027The whips are worried that Labour will take advantage and call a confidence motion in the Government if Tory MPs have snuck away for Christmas.\u0027In an email to all Tory MPs, Mr Smith confirmed that they would be on a \u0027three line whip\u0027 until Wednesday, meaning they must remain available to vote in Parliament.\u0027It is still possible\u0027: Desperate May insists she CAN get...Labour chaos on Brexit as Angela Rayner warns a second...Share this articleHe wrote: \u0027I would like to thank colleagues for your patience and support this week.

It is understood the new deadline, not yet confirmed by the CMA, will be around 21 December, earlier than the supermarkets’ 4 January request.The CMA had sought to issue provisional findings early next year before a final report in March, but the supermarkets argued that the “unprecedented size and complexity” of the case meant they needed more time.A CMA spokesperson said: “We are pleased that the court has confirmed it is for the CMA to set its own timetables and indicated that we do not need to grant an extension until 4 January, as requested by Sainsbury’s and Asda. The CMA will now consider how much more time to give the parties.“Our first priority in this investigation has, and will continue to be, assessing if shoppers would face higher prices or a lower quality of service as a result of the merger and, if so, to prevent that from happening.”In a statement, Sainsbury’s said: “The parties took this step reluctantly and look forward to re-engaging with the CMA and panel and working constructively with them going forward.”The CMA investigation has weighed on the Sainsbury’s share price, which has fallen by almost a fifth since peaking in August. Asda has been owned by the US supermarket Walmart since 1999.The CMA launched an in-depth investigation into the proposed merger in August amid concerns it could reduce competition in the sector.The tie-up would create the largest supermarket chain in the UK by market share, leapfrogging Tesco. The newly formed group would have nearly 3,000 stores and annual sales of more than £50bn.An initial investigation in September found a “realistic prospect of a significant lessening of competition” in 463 places in the UK where local supermarkets’ catchment areas overlapped.The investigation is a major test for the CMA under the leadership of the former Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, who was appointed in April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/156928da3ac2ad0a9cdf1769f62c46d9cb67d0aa/0_336_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d61025f6f2748c6822f0f7c0c68211cc","title":"second brexit referendum europe vote remain eu","story":"If it’s not Jacob Rees-Mogg, it’s Jean-Claude Juncker, the double-barrelled duo giving Theresa May both barrels within 24 hours of each other. No sooner had the monocled mutineer called for May to resign after she had seen off his motion of no confidence than the head of the EU commission was accusing the prime minister of being “nebulous”, as Europe’s heads of government refused to give her even a few crumbs of political comfort to take back home for Christmas. Rebuffed in both Westminster and Brussels, May is coming to resemble a figure from a medieval morality play, scorned and rejected wherever she turns.The result is that a bleak clarity is emerging from the Brexit fog. There is no majority in the Commons for May’s deal. And yet the deal will not be substantively improved by the EU. So Brexit is stuck, parliament’s minimum falling short of Brussels’ maximum. No deal is possible, which surely makes “no deal” possible.Except that MPs and ministers alike insist they will not allow the country to fall off a cliff, crashing out with no deal on 29 March. They have heard the words of the former head of the World Trade Organization, Pascal Lamy, warning Britons that to go from the European single market to trading on WTO terms will be like being demoted from the Premier League to the old fourth ision. Given all that, May – or someone else, if she cannot do it – will have to come up with something else.Which is why the probability of a second referendum, once the quixotic goal of a handful of unreconciled remainers, is increasing with each passing day. May doesn’t need to be persuaded by the democratic logic of seeking popular approval for Brexit as it actually exists, as opposed to the slogan-on-a-bus version the public voted on in 2016. All she needs to decide is that a referendum is her only way out of the current impasse.It’s not just Brexiteers, fearful of losing the prize they won against the odds two and a half years ago, who dislike that possibility. Plenty of remainers too are nervous about a contest they fear they could lose, thereby closing the door for good on a close relationship with Europe. And others, many of them Labour MPs in pro-leave seats, tremble at the sheer hostility the prospect of a second vote arouses in the people they represent.This is a subtler emotion than is usually depicted. It’s often described in simple terms of betrayal, as if leave voters will not forgive their Brexit being “stolen” from them, as Liam Fox puts it. But others describe a quieter sentiment, a resentment that MPs – who are paid to adjudicate on tough and complicated issues – are instead dumping into the laps of voters a conundrum that has stumped the country’s supposed leaders. With that in mind, a couple of Westminster’s more thoughtful figures have been trying to work out how a second referendum, if it comes to that, can avoid being a simple rerun of 2016, with all the animus and ision such a ballot is bound to stir. I’m not referring here to the determination many remainers have to fight a better, more effective campaign: less accountancy, more poetry less cerebral, more emotional less project fear, more project hope less establishment, more insurgent. Though all those concerns are well founded.No, what I have in mind is an effort to make the referendum exercise itself both legitimate in the eyes of leavers and substantively different to the first one. On the first count, it will help if the ballot is seen as a move by May, rather than a demand successfully pressed by the People’s Vote campaign. Much as I admire the latter, leave voters are likelier to accept a plebiscite called by a Tory prime minister seeking to make Brexit happen than one effected by remainers bent on halting it.But it will also help if the two competing propositions on the ballot – and let’s make the hopeful assumption that no parliament would present a no-deal crash-out as if it were a viable option, since that would be criminally irresponsible – are both significantly different from the leave v remain choices of 2016. It’s easy to see how leave would differ this time around. In place of the abstract, wishful idea of leave – which Brexiteers cast as a pain-free cash bonanza and panacea for all Britain’s ills – would be a concrete, detailed plan for leaving: May’s plan, more or less.What, though, of the other side of the ballot paper? Remain will be weakened if it looks like an appeal to wind the clock back to 22 June 2016, as if the status quo ante were some unimprovable nirvana. It would be accused of not having listened to a word leavers have said about why they wanted out.That’s why some are talking of a “reformed remain” option, an alternative to leave that does not smack of a complacent desire to pretend Brexit never happened. For those Labour MPs in leave seats, their chief hope is that they can signal to their voters that both they and the EU itself have heard their concerns on one issue especially: immigration.I admit to finding this effort depressing. I’d rather live in a country where free movement is seen as a cherished right, a two-word promise of liberation – offering Britons the ability to live, work, travel, study and fall in love anywhere across a vast, erse and rich continent. But millions of my fellow citizens don’t see free movement that way. The choice for remainers is to tell those voters they’re wrong, and lose another referendum – or allay their fears and win.In that context, how much more powerful would the remain case be next time if it could say that a Britain that chose to stay in the EU would have more say on migration? No one is expecting an opt-out on free movement: the EU would never grant such a thing. But when Yvette Cooper’s home affairs select committee probed what measures would still be compatible with the rules of the single market, it found many already used by other EU member states – a whole range of controls that, mysteriously, neither David Cameron nor May ever took up – as well as several possibilities, legal under EU treaty law, that have never been properly explored. (Since the referendum, the EU has, for example, revised its rules to prevent workers’ pay and conditions being undercut by employees posted from abroad.) Of course, there are multiple problems with this approach. For one thing, who exactly would negotiate this improved remain option with the EU? Brussels will only talk to governments it would not open up a parallel track to a panel of remain-minded dissidents. Such a process would also take time, though that’s true of any move to a referendum: if this is the path May takes, she will have to rescind or extend article 50.But what it surely comes down to is political will. On Friday Tony Blair suggested Brexit would be as damaging a blow to the European project as it would be to Britain. Accordingly, the EU27 should want to enhance the appeal of remain. Not necessarily, says Charles Grant, the well-plugged-in head of the Centre for European Reform. Sweden, Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands and perhaps Germany may want to help, Grant says, perhaps adding “some tinsel and coloured lights” to various EU loopholes on migration, so that remain can boast of having reformed free movement. But the more “hardcore federalists” in the commission, and in France, “have mixed feelings about our departure. For decades, we’ve been the pebble in their shoe. We’ve been such a bloody pain” that some will be relieved when we’ve gone.Even so, if Britons stare into the abyss of Brexit and decide to step back, voting in a second referendum to stay in the EU, that would be a huge boost to the EU and, given Britain’s size as well as its security and intelligence muscle, a major geopolitical prize. It makes sense to urge the EU to do its bit to ensure that remain has the best shot at winning a fresh contest. I understand why Juncker and friends don’t want to help Theresa May leave. But they have an alternative. They can help us stay."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17560a02ab5ad20bb5978ec48b1b9f444b155173/0_77_2376_1425/master/2376.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=713629e5feecd1fe08fa9cd81baa6713","title":"theresa may brussels pizza hut","story":"For all the drama of her stand-up row with Jean-Claude Juncker, the top line on Theresa May’s save-the-day mission to Brussels is that it resulted in the EU actually removing the only helpful paragraph of the draft conclusions. Never mind “the backstop” this is what is known as “the backwards” – or le backwards, on the continent. Perhaps they should have kept Brownfinger off the plane to Brussels, given that everything she touches turns to this.Things have now gone so badly that I would expect May to be offered a Pizza Hut advert the minute she lands back in the UK. Her fictional analogue is the League of Gentlemen vet, Mr Chinnery, whose ministrations would routinely end in the dog exploding, the tortoise exploding or the parrot exploding. Or an entire pond of koi carp being electrocuted. For the love of God, Veterinary May: please stop trying to make things better.If you are too sensitive for the comedy of embarrassment, please look away now, for it is reported that at one point in her discussions with the EU27, May actually said “Brexit means Brexit”. I mean … I just can’t. “Brexit means Brexit” is the sort of fantastically infantile phrase you can get away with in our fantastically infantile country, but which obviously – obviously! – should never be spoken in civilised society. This is like a parent turning up at a grownups’ party and imagining people want to hear about their child’s potty training. They don’t, OK – any more than grownups want to hear “Brexit means Brexit”. It’s babyish, it’s distasteful and it’s basically a disgusting mess.Other bright spots? Many of you will be feeling that you simply haven’t heard enough on Brexit from that turbo-compromised messenger Tony Blair. For you, there are glad tidings, as Mr Blair broke a 14-minute silence to declare: “Brexit is manmade. It can be unmade by man. We simply must discover the will to change.” Powerful words, there, from the Deepak Chopra of destabilising the entire Middle East. I guess you can’t be a meaningful life coach until you’ve got a couple of hundred thousand deaths under your belt. “Things do not need to be like this,” continued the only Zen master to offer multimillion-pound advice to the Saudi government. “We are not hypnotised to do this. We can assume consciousness. We have free will.”Why does our former prime minister now speak like the sort of wellness guru who might have their coffee-table book on psychic energy promoted via Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop website? The answer remains tantalisingly out of reach – perhaps just beyond the bulletproof curtain to the astral dimension. But it is fair to say that Tony doesn’t look like he’s been playing with a full set of fanny crystals since about 2001.As the week draws to a close, the chain of events that led up to the no-confidence vote against May on Wednesday is rather difficult to categorise. If pushed, I would say it was like Game of Thrones, only re-enacted by the sort of Westminster inadequates who masturbate to Game of Thrones. The fallout is not fallout so much as a political prolapse. Those badge-kissers the ERG are not even dormant, while the parliamentary maths remains exactly as intractable as it was before.All that has emerged more clearly is the list of Tories apparently preparing tilts for the leadership now May has said she won’t be fighting the 2022 election. There are the expected candidates, such as Sajid Javid, while aspirant perspirant Dominic Raab is still desperately trying to make himself happen.That said, Dominic is like Beyoncé compared with David Lidington. The implication of David Lidington’s name being included in the lists of runners and riders is that the already put-upon British people are now expected to find out who David Lidington is. Don’t look at me. All I can tell you is that David Lidington’s newspaper epithet is “the de facto deputy prime minister”, which always reads like a calculated insult, marred only by the fact that you do typically need to know who is being insulted for it to work. For all the cut-through he has, David Lidington might as well be in witness protection.The most eye-catching suggestion is a joint Boris Johnson-Amber Rudd ticket. At this stage in its journey beyond self-esteem, it feels about right that the UK could be led by a woman and the very man she warned was a metaphorical date rapist. “Boris?” Rudd inquired on live TV during the referendum campaign. “Well, he’s the life and soul of the party, but he’s not the man you want driving you home at the end of the evening.” Just to be super-clear: this is a date-rape joke with a drink-drive cover story, as Amber Rudd knew perfectly well when she said it. It’s not like it was said by Andrea Jenkyns, whose attempts to pin the tail on coherence tend toward the excruciating. (We hear much too much about low-information voters, and not nearly enough about low-information politicians.)Yet speaking of the Andreas, it’s great to learn that Andrea Leadsom was making calls to muster support for a bid this week. Andrea’s last leadership campaign simply burned too brightly, extinguishing itself before it made landfall. You have to feel there is so much more to come from Brexit’s Oxo mum.As for what might happen in the next episode of this landmark show we all have to live in, there is bad news for people who want a second referendum or the Norway option. To wit: dog-exploding former May chief of staff Nick Timothy said after this week’s ERG failure that the only outcomes left are a second referendum or the Norway option. So … buy shares in no deal today. I’m kidding, of course: take all your pretend money out of the stock market and buy water purification tablets, a backpack, a tarpaulin and a gun.

Her last big commission was the “cracker packer” statue honouring the lives of female biscuit factory workers in the Cumbrian city of Carlisle.Reeves chose to portray Pankhurst in full tub-thumping mode, standing on a chair as she rallied a crowd. Helen Pankhurst, the suffragette’s great-granddaughter, was among those who unveiled the “Our Emmeline” statue on Friday, 100 years to the day after some women got the vote for the first time in the UK.With her was 12-year-old Fatima Shahid, a pupil at Manchester Enterprise Academy, who told the 6,000-strong crowd that she hoped this was “just the first” of many Mancunian women who would be honoured in sculpture form.About 1,000 thousand schoolchildren were among the many who marched to St Peter’s Square for the unveiling, chanting “deeds not words” as the bronze sculpture was revealed.Beforehand, they danced to Sisters Are Doin’ It For Themselves by Aretha Franklin and Annie Lennox and waved homemade banners. One had felt-tipped “I would rather be a rebel than a slave”, one of Pankhurst’s most famous sayings, and surrounded it with red hearts.link, which runs Manchester’s busy tram system, agreed to pause the trams through the square during the event, to ensure the warning horn did not ruin the moment. Earlier, 94-year-old Nancy Sawyer had volunteered to chain herself to the railings to stop the trams from disturbing the ceremony.Many in the crowd, including Andy Burnham, Greater Manchester’s mayor, wore sashes in suffragette green, white and purple, and rosettes saying “rise up women”.Wendy Eachus, 62, was dressed in her old school hat tied with purple ribbon, walking with the help of a lilac frame. She is one of the “Waspi” women campaigning against state pension inequality. “We are following in the footsteps of the suffragettes,” she said. “Without Emmeline Pankhurst we would not be able to campaign today.”Until Friday, 16 of the 17 statues in Manchester city centre were of men. The exception was that of Queen Victoria, erected 117 years ago, according to local councillor Andrew Simcock, who started the female statue campaign and was the only man to address the launch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd867c65af95a5b2133a87b6a7f53df5c88e33dd/433_363_2286_1372/master/2286.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0e8b44557ffdb2e2b618c35e84a2d60","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Bird battles, snoozing seals and mischievous macaques in this week’s gallery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52a622094f87a1ccb0f7b182b8fd63fee4f1d7a9/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac29dcd5d94e5e743e1d24875ae40eaf","title":"quick and easy roast chicken with a twist","story":"Cookery writer Eve Marleau adds a French-inspired twist to a traditional roast chicken with Boursin As a kid in the late 80s and early 90s, for me, Boursin had one role – to act as an exotic option on the Christmas cheeseboard. In my prime, I could eat upwards of 10 Carr’s table water biscuits slathered in Boursin after seconds of turkey pie and an inordinate amount of chocolate mould dessert.But as a grownup – and as someone who gets more excited over the possibilities contained within the leftovers than the initial purpose of an ingredient – the garlicky cheese with the chant-inducing advert has come to represent versatility as well as comforting familiarity. I’ve long been stirring Boursin through fettuccine with lemon-roasted broccoli, or dolloping spoonfuls on top of slow-roasted red peppers, tomato and fennel. I’ve whisked it with milk to make the sauce for potato dauphinois, combined with soured cream, red onions and prawns, and even spread it on stale sourdough, scattered with pancetta and baked with whisked eggs to make a savoury bread and butter pudding. As an ingredient, it is undeniably simple yet effective, saving the lives of many a withered fridge companion. However, my favourite use is a relatively recent discovery, from a French friend: a roast chicken recipe – with a twist.Requiring only three ingredients: Boursin, lemon and the chicken itself. One Boursin is stuffed into the bird’s cavity with half a lemon, and a second is smeared underneath and over the top of the skin. And that’s it. The result is a creamy, flavoursome and perfectly textured meat that the carver will undoubtedly be standing over and picking at long before it reaches the table.Since learning of this dish a few years back, I’ve found that it’s the perfect recipe for those mellow days between Christmas and the new year, when families are still gathered, but the enthusiasm for spending hours in the kitchen to create a celebratory spread for those around you has dissipated to eating cold stuffing and cranberry sauce from the fridge on the sofa. This roast chicken requires no more than five minutes of preparation, a chopping board and a roasting tin. But the best thing about this recipe? It perfectly balances familiarity and nostalgia with indulgence – and that’s exactly what the festivities are all about.1 free-range organic chicken2 x 150g Boursin½ lemonSalt and ground black pepper1 bunch purple sprouting broccoli, ends trimmed25g butterZest of 1 lemonRoast or mashed potatoes, to servePreheat your oven to 180Cgas mark 4.Remove the string from the chicken and stuff one of the Boursin into the cavity along with the lemon half. Ease the skin of the chicken loose, then spread half of the other Boursin under the skin, using your fingers. Spread the other half over the skin of the whole bird and season well.Lightly oil a roasting tray and place the chicken inside. Cook for 1-1½ hours, until the juice of the chicken runs clear when a knife is inserted into the thickest part of the leg. Allow to rest for 10 minutes.As the chicken is resting, steam or boil the broccoli, then toss with the butter, lemon zest and some seasoning. Carve the chicken and serve with the broccoli and potatoes.Bring a BoursinCombining a creamy, crumbly texture and mouth-watering garlic and herbs, Boursin is a welcome addition to any festive buffet – and a versatile soft cheese for your party season cooking, too.

He’s already got charge of the bank. He’s got the bus line. He got the department stores. And now he’s after us!” Poor George Bailey gets a vision of awful, grasping Potter getting everything and naming everything after himself: Pottersville, a hideous ego-plutocrat takeover. And if he had a hotel chain, it would be called something alliterative, no doubt, like … Potter Palace?And so Frank Capra’s 1946 classic It’s a Wonderful Life comes back to UK cinemas for the umpteenth Christmas runout. The movie which gained mixed notices on release, became wildly popular on US television in the mid-70s when the copyright lapsed and it could be broadcast for nothing – the networks took to showing it every year, to a wave of love and an illusory sense that it had always been this popular. (In 1993, Republic Pictures managed to regain its copyright, ending this gratis TV bonanza which had put their movie in the homes and hearts of millions of Americans. It’s an object lesson in how the small screen isn’t always the enemy of cinephilia.)Can there really be anything new to say in 2018 about It’s a Wonderful Life? Well, maybe. George Bailey, unforgettably played by James Stewart, is progressively forced to abandon his dreams of world travel and college education to stay home and look after the Bailey family’s saving and loan business. His dad tells him: “I feel that in a small way we are doing something important. Satisfying a fundamental urge. It’s deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace.” Young audiences in 1946, or 1976, could hear those lines and nod. Not now. The idea of young people owning their own place in the UK looks as distant and dated as the automobiles and clothes of prewar Bedford Falls.The Baileys’ casual, but affectionate treatment of their African-American “help” in the early scenes (the Baileys can’t afford it later on) may be uncomfortable — Annie is incidentally played by Lillian Randolph, a great comic actor and beautiful gospel singer. But the racism of the ruling class, as represented by Potter, is plain enough, as he seeks to maintain a serf class of tenantry. Bailey helps an Italian-American family buy their house, to the fury of Potter: “Playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic-eaters!”There being no place like home is commonplace enough in the movies, but it’s traditional to allow the traveller his or her experience of Oz, before they realise this. George Bailey stays in Kansas. His freaky “Oz” experience is to see his happy, sociable, public-spirited community turned into a harsher place without him being there. For me, the most powerful moment in the picture comes when George, drunk and despairingly aggressive in a bar, and faced with ruin and prosecution because his hapless Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) has lost the firm’s money is punched in the face by the husband of the teacher he has just upset by yelling at her on the phone. It is a brutal defeat without honour for Bailey, a grisly descent into (temporary) despair, before his redemption.It’s also a mild surprise, every time I see the film, to realise that the trainee angel Clarence (Henry Travers) really only appears in the final quarter of the drama, clutching a copy of Mark Twain’s Tom Sawyer (which by the way is the nearest the film has to a false, or anyway evasive note. Surely the book he should be carrying is Dickens’s A Christmas Carol?) The fantasy or whimsy of Clarence’s existence does not greatly affect the realist tenor of the story as a whole, which is so important for inducing the audience to make an emotional investment in George and his family, an outlay of the heart which happens in tandem with the townspeople entrusting him with their savings. Always a joy to see this film."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8a8825953c9e6a21a5d5a04c02b9661209c1a6f/0_55_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b727a34b291505d4061afa011edbd017","title":"anna jones alternative christmas pudding recipe vegan lebkuchen cookies recipe","story":"A lighter, zesty take on the traditional dessert, plus a big plate of iced lebkuchen cookiesMy family has two puddings on Christmas Day: one Christmas pud for Mum, who adores it, and another, usually a chocolate affair, for those who don’t. But this year, I hope to unite us all with a lighter, brighter version of the traditional dessert, packed with freshly grated (not candied) citrus, lots of stem ginger and chunks of marzipan throughout. This, with a jot of custard or cream, will hopefully win over the sceptics at the table. My favourite festive treat of all has to be lebkuchen. They always grace the plate we put out for Father Christmas, who seems to like them, as he only ever leaves a few crumbs.This is a lighter version of Christmas pudding, with a golden crumb, the fresh zing of zest and the brightness of ginger.

Add the remaining ingredients apart from the oat milk, and mix together with a wooden spoon.Next, stir through the oat milk until you have a thick batter, then spoon it all into the greased bowl.Cut two sheets of greaseproof paper into circles big enough to cover and hang over the rim of the bowl. Grease the piece that sits over the mixture with a little oil, then top with the second piece and a sheet of tin foil. Use the foil to secure the greaseproof paper, then tie some string up and over the bowl to tie the covers tightly in place.Put a small plate (one that you don’t particularly mind about) in the bottom of a large saucepan, and put the pudding bowl on top. Pour cold water into the pan until it comes halfway up the side of the bowl.Bring to a boil, then cover with a lid and simmer on a low heat for three hours. Check the water regularly, so it doesn’t dry out – top up to halfway again, if necessary.Carefully lift the pudding bowl out of the pan – at this point, you can turn it out and serve it at once, or leave it to cool in its foil package. When cooled, replace the greaseproof and foil with fresh layers and tie again with string this way, you can steam it to heat through again for 30 minutes when ready to serve. Put in the fridge or in a cool, dry place until needed.This year I consulted the queen of German cooking, Anja Dunk, for some lebkuchen tips, and I think I’ve just made the best batch yet. These little biscuits are traditionally made at the end of November, then stored until Christmas (they have no butter, so they keep). But I am never that organised, so I make them in the days before Christmas Eve. The authentic recipe for lebkuchen suggests chilling the dough for at least eight hours before baking, to ferment it slightly, but if you don’t have time, these work well after 30 minutes.For the biscuits1 egg100g light brown sugar1 tbsp dark honey125g ground almonds65g mixed peel, finely chopped½ tsp ground cinnamon1½ tsp mixed spice3 cloves, groundZest of 1 orange½ tsp baking powder2 sheets filo or rice paper, cut into 30cm circles (you can do this with the end of a cookie cutter)For the icing75g icing sugar, sifted 1 tsp runny honeyJuice ½ orangeBeat the egg and sugar with an electric whisk until the mixture is pale and thickened. Add the remaining ingredients, apart from the filo or rice paper, (measure out the honey on a lightly oiled spoon to make it easier to handle). Mix to combine, then wrap the mixture and chill for at least half an hour – preferably eight hours.When ready to bake, heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)325Fgas 3.Divide the filo or rice paper circles between two baking sheets. Measure out spoonfuls of dough, about 15g each, roll between your hands to form balls, then press them down flat to fit the circles. Bake in the middle of the oven for 12 minutes, until just golden.Meanwhile, make the icing. Mix the icing sugar, honey and orange juice to create a runny, creamy glaze. You can make this ahead but you might need to loosen it just before you paint it on to the biscuits.Once golden, remove the biscuits from the oven and paint the tops with the glaze right away you want to cover the top of the biscuit. Leave to cool on the tray, then serve or store in an airtight tin for up to a week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1feae2c151376c070b3f8e5f224ed86fb2b834b2/0_1939_4008_2405/master/4008.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f900514efc3832ec64e556a54c356840","title":"christmas drinks sweet sherry festive wine","story":"Sweet sherry deserves a spot in the festive limelightYou may only ever put it out for Santa, but sweet sherry deserves to be one of your festive drinks in its own right, not least because it’s one of the bargains of the wine world.A step up in quality from that would be oloroso sherries such as Gonzalez Byass Matusalem, which, like cream sherry, is based on oloroso sweetened with pedro ximénez, but which incorporates sherries that are around 30 years old.

I think Jamaal has been quite sensible.“The squad wanted to do it because it is a tradition for some players, especially in England, but they’ve been quite good about it. I think the fans will appreciate that they’re just focused on football.”Newcastle are 15th having won only three times all season and are just three points above 18th-placed Huddersfield.Asked whether the situation could change should they beat David Wagner’s side, Benítez smiled. “Hopefully we’ll not lose, touch wood,” he said. “And if everything goes right for us, still the players will not do anything – or at least not that I know about! They’re quite responsible – and they know every game is really important for us.”Indeed, his squad are well aware that the next two fixtures – at Huddersfield and against fellow strugglers Fulham on Tyneside next Saturday – could prove pivotal. “Every match is like a final,” said Benítez, who reported that he had “no news’ on Newcastle’s mooted takeover. “We have to approach every game thinking that one point can make a difference at the end of the season,” he said. “The next two, against sides very close to us, will be massive.“We need to win against those teams around us at the bottom it’s like six points if you win. And, if you play well, you can beat them but, against the top teams, you can play well and still lose.”Benítez added: “The bottom half of the table is where I expected us to be right now and we need to be realistic. We know we have some games we can win and maybe some we cannot.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfc520cc001b58495982ff2eaf0a078a2aef6012/0_149_6132_3679/master/6132.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c95e93fcfd879e4b870ac43152e799f","title":"olivier giroud winning premier league chelsea france","story":"Chelsea striker and the French voice of the Green Goblin discusses his World Cup high, how he coped with once being jeered by France fans and how being a fringe player involves patienceFive months on and Olivier Giroud still struggles to get his head around the fact he is a World Cup winner. Reality kicks in on occasion. Most obviously there was the moment on the open-top bus, crawling down the Champs Élysées in mid-July serenaded by half a million compatriots, when nine air force jets roared overhead trailing red, white and blue in their plumes and he felt “like a rock star”. He will receive a replica of the trophy any day now to sit alongside the framed photograph of his eldest daughter, Jade, kissing the real thing amid the ticker tape and pyrotechnics at the Luzhniki.Then, more recently, there was a conversation on the Chelsea bus on the way back from a sobering midweek defeat by Wolverhampton Wanderers. Eden Hazard, Antonio Rüdiger, Mateo Kovacic and Giroud sat digesting the result and its implications for their title challenge. “It was a long journey and Rüdi was teasing me: ‘Anyway, what do you care? You won the World Cup’,” he said. “Mateo, who’s won three Champions Leagues, said there is nothing above the World Cup. So maybe people do see me differently, especially in the dressing room. I’ve been blessed but I’ve always said football is an everlasting new beginning. You can’t rest on your laurels. You have to prove yourself again.This seemed an apt time for Giroud to reflect on a year like no other. Retreat to last Christmas and he was entering the final six months of his contract at √Arsenal, where his unsatisfactory status as a Premier League substitute and Europa League starter was potentially jeopardising a place at the tournament in Russia. Chelsea offered him the chance to play while still enjoying “London life” with a deal to 2019. Arsenal’s club calendar carries his image this month as Mr December but Giroud has long since moved on.The 32-year-old is settled, feeling as if he has “been here a few years already”. Off the pitch, his profile is so elevated he has taken the first step towards a Hollywood career as the voice of the Green Goblin in the French version of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which was released on Wednesday. One of his national teammates, Presnel Kimpembe, plays Scorpion, though both claim dubbing an animated film has rather stymied their ability to show their acting skills.It was the summer that truly transformed Giroud. This was a player jeered by France fans, disgruntled at Karim Benzema’s non-selection while police investigated his alleged involvement in a blackmail case, despite scoring in a friendly win over Cameroon in Nantes just before Euro 2016. L’Équipe’s front page had christened him “Le mal aimé” (“The unloved one”), with his teammates inducing a chuckle by chorusing the Claude François song of the same name on the coach back to Clairefontaine.“That was the toughest time. I never had a problem with Karim, even if he is not my best friend, and we always spent good time in the national team. But people portrayed us as fighting. The fans were not happy with me: not my contribution or performance on the pitch, but because I was there and Benzema was not. And that was just before I had a good Euros. The coach defended me because it was injustice. My performances were good. It was not me, the one to blame.”Recalling that criticism was poignant. Giroud was speaking at an event at Stamford Bridge to discuss social media and its impact on isolation at Christmas. Players from the club’s academy were in attendance, together with pupils from five secondary schools at which the Chelsea Foundation has placed full-time staff aiming to enhance and develop emotional wellbeing and resilience among the students. Giroud, alongside his clubmate Rob Green, listened to and engaged with the teenagers as they spoke on topics ranging from online bullying to loneliness.He steered clear of the platform during the summer. Giroud’s World Cup was scoreless, the striker effectively acting as a decoy, creating space and opportunities for Kylian Mbappé and Antoine Griezmann. The comparisons to Stéphane Guivarc’h from 1998 were easily drawn.“When you are only behind for nine minutes through the whole competition, what is the most important thing? To keep the result. I’ve never defended as much as against Belgium in the semi-final. I was playing as a No 6. Obviously you always have haters who say: ‘You didn’t score,’ but I know how many I have for the French team.”It was telling that his teammates urged him to take the penalty that beat Uruguay in their final game of a glittering calendar year last month. That was a 33rd goal in 87 caps.Chelsea’s players appreciate him just as much. Hazard has not scored this season without Giroud on the pitch and yet the striker has made only five top-flight starts. He will hope to make that six at Brighton on Sunday, bolstered by a fifth goal in seven club games at Vidi, but it is tempting to wonder whether the year has gone full circle, landing him back on the fringes at an elite club. Not that he has any complaints. He returned later than Álvaro Morata, with whom he generally vies for inclusion but who has a slight knee injury, and considers their duel “fair competition”. “Álvaro made a great pre-season, so it was normal not to take him off the team even to put in a world champion. Let’s be patient, work in training and come back stronger.“I prefer to be at a big club rather than playing every week in a less prestigious team and I still have targets. To win a Premier League is my last dream as a footballer, maybe more than winning a Champions League, because I know how tough it is to win this league. I have teammates here who have won it, so I’m a bit jealous. I want to make it happen. Look, I know we lost at Wolves but we beat Manchester City, so don’t count on me to give up on that dream just yet. I don’t want to end with any regrets.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a107abb608d11f2fe36bec1a2e0b3cad7c963b6f/0_171_5348_3208/master/5348.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cc3a722969e71e9e9e958f10f6639fd","title":"football society racism remedy raheem sterling","story":"To be fair to the more risque element of Chelsea’s matchday support, they have been very thorough this week in representing the full political spectrum. On the one hand an ad hoc hostile environment for Anglo-Jamaican British citizens. On the other a little throwaway antisemitism on Thursday night in Hungary. This is exemplary political balance and frankly the BBC for one could learn a great deal from it.All that remains to complete the circle is for Sterling’s alleged Stamford Bridge abuser to resign from the East Stand and then turn up six months later as an outside Windrush Ticket bet for the next Conservative prime minister. And for Jeremy Corbyn to condemn, with a sad sigh, not specifically these Yid chants but “all kinds of offensive football chanting everywhere”.It’s funny because it’s true! Or at least, it might not be very funny. But that’s not because it isn’t just a little bit true. Where have we got to, anyway, with racism and football? Have enough people expressed outrage, or weary bafflement? How many more bans, censures and educational measures should we call for? And does anybody out there really think, deep down, that this issue rests solely, or in any serious degree at the door of a profiteering professional spectator sport?This is the first thing worth saying about all this. It is both accurate and also meaningless to suggest “football” has a racism problem. No matter how convenient it may be to locate all evil in one place, the fact remains “football” is not a discrete, concrete thing, but is simply a reflection and an extension of the society around it.Football can instruct and police the people who come through its doors. At its best it provides an exemplar of how to behave. But in the words of John Barnes in these pages earlier this week: tell a stadium of racists to stop saying racist things and what you’ve got is a bunch of silent racists.The lesson of the rise in reported abuse, and of viciousness in all its forms, is that our society is producing racists. Football doesn’t make this happen. But it does provide the most visible public space where people get together and shout their brains right down the lens of a TV camera.Looking back you could almost feel it building during the first half at Stamford Bridge last Saturday. The game had already begun to tilt over to that side of the pitch. At one point Sterling and Riyad Mahrez drew a wave of rage by flipping the ball between them on the touchline as Marcos Alonso flailed about after it, a prop in a beach football training drill.Later Mahrez left Alonso wandering off the wrong way with that same old move, the most widely-advertised sideways jink in Premier League history, a sideways jink so well-advertised it should probably be up for some kind of industry award at a ceremony full of high-fiving men in red glasses called Tristan.The crowd bayed and hollered. Sterling came across to take a throw-in. And the words came out (or not: the fan in question denies this). Football gave the words a stage. And while all sports have a duty to police their environment with zero tolerance, to educate, to become the opposite of this in every one of its structures, it would also be dishonest to suggest football put those words there.Perhaps it is simply a weird coincidence that our elected government has for the last five years been deporting people who moved to this country from Jamaica aged five, and that Raheem Sterling, as a point of interest, also moved to this country from Jamaica aged five. Hmm. Hostile environment you say, to be policed by everyday people. Now what would that look like? At which point, in the documentary film version of this column, the narrator cuts to angry shouting people leaning over an advertising hoarding screaming abuse at a black man.The finger of blame also points inwards here, back to pages like this one. This is the second thing worth noting about all this, the wider response to Sterling’s own statement on media portrayals of black footballers, the idea that language, imagery and narrative tone fuels a closing down of opportunity, narrowed horizons, fixed ideas.It is a difficult subject, one that we all have to be willing to be schooled in to digest the idea that repeatedly calling Paul Pogba lazy or frivolous is likely to reinforce the same historic negative barriers some black players have mentioned this week, the same insulting stereotypes you find in Jim Crow or Tintin in the Congo.The editorial page of the Sun has already strongly denied that its depiction in its news section of Sterling buying a house for his mother using the words “Lavish … flash … blinged-up … bragging … crystal-encrusted … brother … baby … the lights and shit … the big daddy Rangey” could have contributed to the abuse and racist physical assault he has suffered since.Maybe it’s right about that. And maybe lessons will be learned too. Above all the idea that it is necessary to believe people when they tell you this matters, that language can be harmful, that these ideas do stick.Because there is of course an upside. Sport in its pure form is the opposite of all this, the opposite of judging a person on pigment, presenting instead the most thrilling of basic meritocracies. This is its gift, its capacity to inspire and lift us beyond all this mud. It is the job of all of us to live up to it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57c25bb419f90ff6f23e07c380204577984d0ce2/2_0_8723_5236/master/8723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d9bf7db63ab782f125d4f4377f6ffe","title":"bolognese and bonding why i love cooking with my children","story":"With smart appliances like the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, getting your kids to help out in the kitchen is easier than ever. Mum-of-three Antonia Windsor explains why cooking with your kids is the perfect opportunity for bonding, belly laughs and some stealth mathsBy the time my middle child Ziggy, now five, was just nine months old he had already joined me in the kitchen. He would sit on the floor with pans while I threw down the potato peelings for him to stir and spoon. I loved this bonding time with him, and proudly posted pictures of him on social media: my chef in the making. My two-year-old Zenya is following in his footsteps, often by my side while I’m chopping, offering up plates of pretend pizza for me to mime eating or cups of imaginary hot chocolate to sip.My eldest, Zayla, who is now six, had less interest in pretend cooking, but as soon as she could mix real flour in a bowl with real milk and crack an egg into it she was desperate for us to make pancakes on a weekly basis.I began to love and dread with equal measure the unfolding of the aprons, knowing that my kitchen would be chaos in just a few short minutes, but knowing, too, that there would be belly laughs and bonding that no other activity quite reproduces.Not only is cooking a fun, sensory activity for children it is also a great way for children to develop pride and confidence in their abilities. To create something from raw ingredients and actually get to eat the end product gives children a great sense of satisfaction.It is also a great way for small children to develop fine motor skills. Chopping, mixing, spreading and spooning are all actions that help develop hand-eye coordination and build strength in little fingers. As children get older they can start to read recipes for themselves and learn about weights and measures, turning family cooking into an easy educational activity that the children don’t need a spoonful of sugar to swallow. If I want to make our cooking a little more challenging mathematically, I double the quantities in a recipe and ask the children to help with the calculations. I also find it’s an easy way to help them understand concepts such as fractions - particularly when cutting a homemade cake into slices.If you are looking for inspiration on what to cook with the family, smart kitchen technology can really help you out the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, for instance, can suggest child-friendly recipes based on the ingredients you already have in stock. We’re all big fans of the CBeebies programme I Can Cook, which has a fabulous range of multicultural recipes that are simple for children to make, and the Samsung Family Hub™ can help out here too – you can stream TV* to the built-in screen from your smartphone**.I find that when we make things ourselves from scratch it is easier to slip in healthy ingredients. Now, when we make pancakes, I slip in chia seeds and linseed, almond flour and coconut sugar. The children are happy because there are more ingredients to mix in the bowl, and they eat their creations hungrily, having hovered at the pan as I fry each one, desperate for their first taste.Now my children are old enough, we have progressed from pancakes and biscuits to them helping with dinner preparation. The children use butter knives to chop mushrooms for bolognese sauce, or help with the mashing of potato for shepherd’s pie.I talk to them as we cook. I tell them about ingredients, about where they come from and when they are in season, and I share family history, describing the food my husband’s mother prepares in Zimbabwe and the French-influenced dishes that my mum and gran cooked for me during my childhood in Jersey. In this way, I hope that our cooking together is a way that I can pass on traditions and family recipes, and help my children to grow into confident cooks who can pass these traditions down to their own children.* Service available on the Samsung Smart TV 6400 series and above, released in 2015** Requires Samsung Galaxy S6 and above or Samsung Galaxy Note 5, 7, 8 and 9 seriesDiscover how the Samsung Family Hub™ can help make your kitchen a more enjoyable place for all your family at samsungukfamilyhub"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3318994f724b574ee48a01cfaf4202d5f9c7b299/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b91ba024cc71993216c3ec641337fd55","title":"have you or your partner recently given birth share your experiences with us","story":"We’d like to hear about your physical and mental recovery after birthMost parents will tell you that nothing prepares you for the arrival of your first child.

I had always wanted to travel and my grandfather and one of my aunts lived in New Zealand, which made it an easy option. I quickly settled into my new life. Among my new friends were a Korean couple about my age, Kumlyong and Mihwa, who were in one of my classes. They were great fun we laughed a lot.Kumlyong and Mihwa had decided to emigrate from South Korea the political climate there at the time was not good, and they were looking for somewhere open-minded and accepting. Canada seemed a good option. While their application was being processed, they moved to South Korea for a while, having just discovered that Mihwa was pregnant with their first child, a girl. I was sad to see them go, but we promised to stay in touch. Whenever I wanted to send them a letter, I had to find a Korean person to write the address on the envelope, because I couldn’t copy the Korean symbols accurately.In one letter they sent me, they asked if they could name the baby after me. I felt so honoured and wrote straight back to say yes. I remember receiving one more letter, a few months later, with a picture of Mihwa holding the newborn Penny. Sadly, after their move to Canada and my return home to Scotland, we lost touch.I travelled a lot over the years, living in Europe and Africa, finally settling into a career managing community energy projects in Africa for the Scottish government. But wherever I was, I would often think about my young namesake. With the advent of the internet, I searched regularly for Penny and her parents, but never with any luck.Out of the blue, a couple of weeks before Christmas last year, my phone beeped. It was a slightly hesitant message from a young Korean-Canadian lady who said she thought she might be named after me. She asked if I had lived in New Zealand in 1994. I was completely overjoyed. I had had no idea whether “Little” Penny even knew the story behind her name, so to discover that she had been looking for me gave me a warm feeling.We ended up messaging all evening and I discovered that Penny was now 23 – which made me feel ancient. She had known the story of how she got her name all her life and had always wanted to find me, but her parents had not been able to remember my surname. However, that day, her father had come across one of my old letters, with my surname on the envelope. Armed with this, Penny did a search on Facebook and her mother recognised me instantly.We chatted a lot via Messenger after that. Penny told me that she feels incredibly lucky to have grown up in Canada, surrounded by ersity and acceptance, and that she is grateful to be fluent in English. She said she is often asked why she has her name – not a common one in Canada and particularly unusual for a Korean-Canadian.After a few months, Penny ended up making plans to travel with her family to Europe, tagging on Scotland at the end to allow the Pennys to meet. I went to meet her and her family at Edinburgh airport at the end of August this year. Waiting felt like being in a film almost surreal. I recognised her straight away. I hugged Little Penny and adored her instantly. She has a lovely voice that makes her sound older than she is and she comes across as a very calm person – very unlike me. Within a few hours of meeting, we found ourselves looking for things we had in common, as if we were genetically related. That made everyone laugh.None of us could believe that we had found each other after 24 years. Penny and I have stayed in regular contact. She is working three waitressing jobs while she decides what she wants to do with her life. I hope to visit them all in Canada in the next couple of years.I have no children of my own, so in a strange way I feel as if I have found something akin to a long-lost daughter. I often complain about social media and how everyone is buried in screens instead of engaging with the real world. But I have to acknowledge that Little Penny would never have found me were it not for Facebook.•Do you have an experience to share?

The pantheon of celebrated Christmas pop songs is a surprisingly small. There have been attempts to expand the canon over the years by including songs that were relative flops on release – Elton John’s Step Into Christmas, left in the dust by Slade and Wizzard back in 1973, or the Waitresses’ Christmas Wrapping, in at 45 with a bullet in 1982 – but you could still fit the lot on one CD. And it’s the absolute apotheosis of music you’re going to hear whether you want to or not. In Britain at least, the only way to avoid repeated exposure to Wonderful Christmastime and Fairytale of New York over December is to adopt a lifestyle of hermetic seclusion with no access to broadcast media and no contact with your fellow man, or to spend the entire month wearing earplugs, drastic approaches both.For all the opprobrium heaved the Christmas song’s way, writing a lasting new one is clearly an incredibly tough thing to do: if it wasn’t, everyone would do it, with the delicious prospect of an annual payday in mind. In fact, it’s not for want of trying. In 2018 you can take your pick from an eclectic array of festive offerings by Engelbert Humperdinck, Jessie J, William Shatner and Eric Clapton, the latter clearly an essential purchase for anyone who feels the one thing their record collection currently is a Dire Straits-ish version of Jingle Bells set to a pumping house beat and EDM-tinged synthesisers. The classiest pop offering comes from John Legend. The music on A Legendary Christmas sits at a sophisticated junction between retro soul, jazz and swing the guests are blue-chip – Stevie Wonder adds harmonica to a version of What Christmas Means to Me, a song he first recorded on his own Christmas album 51 years ago – and the producer is the perennially cool Raphael Saadiq.The choice of material shows moments of real inspiration amid the standard seasonal fare. It’s hard not to think that the world might have somehow struggled on without another version of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas or Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire, nice though Legend’s readings are. It’s at its best when it goes off piste, reworking Vince Guaraldi’s heavenly Christmas Time Is Here from the soundtrack of A Charlie Brown Christmas, and digging deep into Motown’s oft-forgotten penchant for tinselly tunes: the gently psychedelic Purple Snowflakes was recorded by Marvin Gaye in the mid-60s but went unreleased for 30 years Give Love on Christmas Day originally formed part of the Jackson 5’s alternately sublime and faintly troubling 1970 Christmas Album, a record you can succumb to only if you put out of mind Michael Jackson’s heartbreaking line about looking longingly out of the studio window as other children played, forced to record songs about a holiday he wasn’t allowed to celebrate.In fact, A Legendary Christmas’s sophistication is both its big selling point and its major drawback. The arrangements are beautifully done and sepia-toned: tastefully muted horns, softly pattering drums, deft bass lines, an unexpectedly blues-y take on Merry Christmas Baby. The version of Silver Bells, recast as uptown early 70s soul, is completely fantastic. But after a while – and A Legendary Christmas goes on for the best part of an hour – you do find yourself wondering if it might not all be a little too restrained for its own good. The best Christmas records are usually attended by a certain brazen shamelessness – there’s a reason Christmas hits flourished in the glam era and the early 80s – and there’s none of that on offer here: you start longing for a moment where it loosens its tie, when Legend lays into the sherry and really lets rip.It doesn’t happen: instead, his original material tends to the sombre. By Christmas Eve updates I’ll Be Home for Christmas, best-known in its Elvis Presley version, replacing that song’s affecting fatalism – its subject patently isn’t going to make it – with can-do attitude. Wrap Me Up in Your Love is a great song in the same 70s mode as Silver Bells, but it doesn’t feel terribly Christmassy – you get the feeling it was lying around and had a few references to mistletoe and presents grafted on at the last moment. And Waiting for Christmas is really bleak: full of loneliness and exclusion, its protagonist staring down a world where everyone else is enjoying themselves. It’s realistic and moving, but it’s clearly not joining Macca and Mariah on Tesco’s PA any time soon.

By  Alexander HurstEvery time I crossed the courtyard, walked past the well in the corner and slipped out of the baby blue gate nestled into the high brick wall that surrounded my Chadian host family’s house, I instantly became nasara. It’s a Ngambay word that means both “foreigner” and “white person” at the same time. A little pack of children would follow me down the red-dirt street, chanting “nah-sa-rah, nah-sa-rah” and laughing.During my first weeks in Moundou I had protested once – in jest – to Sem, a balding evangelical pastor with a belly and a deep laugh, who was my NGO’s main contact in the town. “You know my mom is black, right?” I said to him, from the passenger seat of his SUV.He chuckled, and simultaneously looked away from the dirt road as he accelerated his Toyota that sported a Christian fish sign and an American flag sticker on its bumper.“Yes, well,” he paused and pointed to my bare forearm, then looked me in the eyes, my blue eyes. “Just look at you, and then look at us!” He laughed again, then he turned his head back to the road and blared the car’s horn angrily at a motorcycle that was approaching the intersection from our left. He hit the accelerator again, forcing the motorcycle, or clando, as they are called locally, to swerve aside as we blew past in a cloud of dust.My friend Frederic worked at the largest employer in Moundou, a textiles company named CotonTchad, where he shovelled coal into furnaces for six hours a day. The company ran a “club”, which consisted of a few cabanas clustered around a tennis court that hadn’t been played on in 30 years, and a pool that lived a permanent dry season. It had pizza and free internet. Chadians with cars, and nasaras, went there.A few weeks after I had arrived in Moundou, Frederic took me to Club CotonTchad. The city hadn’t passed into dry season yet, and so the red-earth roads were jagged with ruts made by rainstorms, and our bicycles jostled and bumped until we got to the Rond Point de la Femme roundabout, then turned on to a paved main street that lead to across the Logone River, and eventually to N’Djamena.As we neared the river, the look and feel of the city dripped away to a dozen cracking, once cream-coloured concrete houses set back on lawns bordered by bushes in place of spike-topped front walls. This was the old area that, in colonial times, had been reserved for the French. There would have been a barricade at the beginning of the road, and Chadians would have been denied entry. Now, the houses belonged to CotonTchad, and where they finally ended, the club sat perched against the banks of the river.The green uniformed guard at Club CotonTchad’s gate did his own double take at me when I dismounted my bicycle and unclasped my helmet. He looked at me curiously, this nasara on a bicycle instead of in a car, but stepped aside and waved me in. I passed with a Parisian-lilted bonjour and he said bonjour back with the Chadian “r” that rolls off the tongue. A few steps in, I realised that Frederic was no longer beside me, and turned around to see that he had been stopped by the same guard who had let me pass unchallenged just moments before. I went back.“It’s OK,” I told him, “Frederic’s just showing me around. We’re going to go in and probably grab a Coca-Cola.”And so, Frederic and I walked into the heart of Club CotonTchad, where its post-imperial rust was framed by manicured grass – the kind with thick, sandpapery blades that can be coaxed out of a desiccated ground with only mildly exorbitant water use. We sat in plastic chairs at a round plastic table, flecked with our own sweat. It was pushing past 30C. I ordered the two most expensive Cokes in Moundou. Frederic poured his into a glass, I drank mine from the bottle. The Coke left a saccharine film in my mouth.Then we biked home in the rain, and even in the downpour I felt hot and dirty. On the way back an unknown stranger stopped us on the side of the road in the rain. He yelled something in Ngambay, and Frederic tried to calm him down. He looked at me then, in his stained and torn green shirt, gestured toward my helmet, and spoke to me in French.“A white man in Africa, he’s permitted everything,” he said with anger. “But what if I were to go to Europe, to France – what would happen then?”Biking away, in a country where I was unquestionably privileged and seen as white, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was passing, and that maybe, just maybe, this man was the only other one who knew. In Chad, I couldn’t have it both ways, couldn’t slip into the well-defined role of being white when it suited me, and then set myself apart from it when it did not. In Chad I was white.Passing for white is a well-anchored, though marginal, phenomenon in American racial history. There was never a uniform definition of who “counted” as black in the US, alternating between one-quarter ancestry (Virginia’s designation of “mulatto” in 1822), and the “one-drop rule” that spread throughout southern states during the Jim Crow era.Even as late as 1982, Susie Guillory Phipps, who identified as white, but whose great-great-great-great-grandmother was black, brought a lawsuit against the state of Louisiana to overturn the law forcing her birth certificate to declare her to be black. The law – a 1970 update from a previous one whose standard was “a trace of Negro ancestry” – had established 132 as the new colour line, and state genealogists had determined that Susie Phipps was 332 black. She lost her case.“It’s funny about passing,” the 1920s author Nella Larsen writes in one of the earliest novels to engage the phenomenon, “we disapprove of it and at the same time condone it. It excites our contempt and yet we rather admire it. We shy away from it with an odd kind of revulsion, but we protect it.” At the time she was writing, between 2,500 and 30,000 African Americans with light enough skin and physical features that allowed them to “pass” unquestioned into white society often did.Adrian Piper, ambiguously pigmented and a conceptual artist, writes in an essay, Passing for White, Passing for Black, that “in the African American community, we do not ‘out’ people who are passing as white in the European American community,” perhaps in recognition of a decision born in some sort of pain.Internalised racism, some may taunt. Pity, others may respond. The desire for “whiteness” shows up throughout our history as a persistent response to racism, or our notions of beauty, or a desire to belong, to be privy to the intimate moments of the Leitkultur through the unacknowledged silence that acknowledges you as just that. And those moments can happen, they can buzz in and out of your life, leaving you flecked with power and its seductiveness one moment, and then a sense of disembodiment in the next.One day you can grab your coffee from the counter of a Parisian cafe, cringing as the barista asks where you’re from, and then replies – curiously, innocently, unaware of what her words mean in the context of a country that has in its history counted people as fractions – that you don’t look cent pour cent américain, and the next day your friend’s uncle can tell you that he’s actually been to Ohio once for business, to Cincinnati, where he stayed in a motel that was kind of scary, he explains, leaning in and dropping his voice low, because the whole place was – almost to a whisper now – filled with black people.It can be tauntingly, cloyingly sweet to pass into the club in silence, unchallenged.The word “passing” entered my lexicon in the early days of 1999, when I was eight years old. We had had five snow days in a row, which was almost unheard of. Every night we kept putting our pyjamas on inside-out for luck, and every night it kept raging snow and ice. With the days off, I had read Black Like Me, John Howard Griffin’s account of the way he chemically darkened his skin and then intentionally passed for black while travelling through the deep south in the 1950s.A sprawling, abandoned lot sat across the street from my house, next to a meatpacking plant that made the whole block smell like sausage on Wednesday afternoons. The neighbourhood was a little mecca of multiculturalism in the middle of a ruined midwestern steel town that didn’t mean it was tranquil. In a city split by its river between a predominantly white west side and a black east side, the neighbourhood, which fell just west of the river, was seeing its own racial isions revealed and exacerbated by a nascent onslaught of gentrification. Every block-club meeting became a battle royale for the soul of the neighbourhood, roiling with the tensions between the (white) “social justice gentrifiers”, the (white) “urban warrior gentrifiers” who had followed them a decade later, and the minority residents who preceded both and were slowly being priced out of the few square miles of city they called home.Yet the neighbourhood had still only rounded the first base of gentrification. Though dotted with half-finished, half-million-dollar “townhomes”, it still hosted a shabby, peeling Catholic Worker house and community theatre in the southern half, a big open-air food market to the east, a gay spa and gay nightclub around the corner from my street, and the housing projects on the northern edge by the lake.Each part of the neighbourhood had its characters. There was Shorty, a sometimes – no, mostly – homeless handyman who once saved an elderly couple from a burning house and collected his citizen of the year award in paint-dripped cargo shorts. “Bubby” Hawk, a teenage guy who swore incessantly, had a trick bike pimped out with neon lights and gold handlebars, and who set off bottle rockets next to the browned-out carcasses of the old cars in his house’s yard. The screech from the bottle rockets upset the retired judge and second world war veteran-turned-pacifist down the street because the sound took him back to Normandy, where he had lain shot in the back. A well-off, white investor, who would eventually develop the vacant lot into fortress-like townhomes, loved peeling down the street in his red, vintage Ferrari and would put up the neighbourhood’s sole “BushCheney” sign in front of his house.An evangelical pastor who lived at the intersection of Bubby’s home and the lot had painted, in slightly off-level stencilled red letters, “The John 3:16 Building” on his large but ageing house. The Catholic Workers, with a completely different interpretation of the “Red Letters”, protested against the Cleveland Air Show (or more precisely, the military presence at it) every summer with signs, songs and street theatre. And our neighbourhood mailman (also a Catholic deacon), hosted a legendary fall potluck party in his backyard that, without fail, degenerated into fairly serious drinking with a light touch of pot after midnight.That winter, the lot was still empty, and a pickup kept ploughing the gravel circle in the middle, which meant that the snowbanks it created kept getting higher and higher, reinforced every time it stormed ice. We tunnelled them out and ringed the tunnels with snow-forts. Other kids decided they would knock the forts down, and kick the tunnels in. As they chased me into my house, the words they shouted stuck. “Get whitey!” they yelled.“Yeah, let’s jump this little white boy’s ass.”They had no idea that a few years later, when I became a pre-teen, my mother and I would come close to having the talk.“Look at me,” she would say one day, as if the thought had been squatting at the back of her mind, and she wanted to express it before it got lost. “When you walk out of a store, don’t keep your hands in your pocket. I saw you do that the other day. Things might be different when you’re out with your father, but you don’t want to give anyone any reason or excuse to accuse you of shoplifting.”“You’re a young black man,” she added. “Even if your friends end up fine, you’re the one who will end up in trouble.”But in the winter of 1999, at not quite nine years old, the trouble on my mind was literally on the outside of a glass door, looking in. As the group of boys angrily pelted the house and cars with snow, I held up my middle finger at them, felt my heart beat, stared and determined to myself that there was extraordinarily little that I had in common with them, or wanted to have in common with them.I knew that outside that door, I was physically powerless. As a product of an educated, leftist social circle, I knew – perversely – that my power, a fundamentally greater power, was structural. It lay in my ability to navigate with confidence and ease the codes, institutions and expectations of polite, white, society. The choice between power and powerlessness seemed so clear.I wore successive pairs of neon-yellow running shoes when I was young my group of neighbourhood friends (three white, one black) told me they were “pretty white”. I got good grades, and to my classmates, that too was “pretty white”. The syntax I used, the way I formed words between my tongue and teeth. Pretty white. My favourite song was Everlong by the Foo Fighters, I was building a desktop computer at the weekends, every year I reread practically the entire Tolkien canon. It was all pretty white, pretty white, pretty white.I wrote about the yellow shoes in my college application essay and got into Amherst, an elite liberal arts college in overwhelmingly white western Massachusetts. Because my exam scores qualified me for a national scholarship only available to African American students, I got to cash a $2,500 cheque and didn’t have to join the work-study scheme. And I felt like an impostor, like no matter what I wore, it would always be a disguise.I had crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, where police attacked civil rights protesters in 1965, and grown up reading books like Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry. I had watched Amistad and newsreels of firehoses pinning protesters against walls while police dogs snapped at their feet and officers bashed their heads in with billy clubs. I had gone to teach-ins about the Children’s March of 1963 in Birmingham, Alabama summer social justice camps about race and class and urban poverty learned about the early civil rights leader Ida B Wells and stepped into sanctuaries that had welcomed Martin Luther King. I knew the lyrics to Go Down Moses, and had celebrated Juneteenth, the holiday that celebrates the end of African American enslavement.And still, I thought, what right did my clear blue eyes – the ones that got me stopped in public by middle-aged women, that brought compliments from security guards and pre-911 trips to the cockpit from flight attendants – what right did those eyes have to inhabit someone else’s struggle, someone else’s pain?It was only years later that I would learn about the myriad moments of discrimination my mother had hidden from me while I was growing up. Like the neighbours who had eventually stopped their children from playing with me when I was five. “Not the chocolate ones,” she had overheard the woman say to her daughter. Or how despite an extremely high score on my entrance exam to Saint Ignatius high school, I had been “overlooked” for the honours programme until my mother had intervened with an admissions officer. The school, she told me just recently, had a history of doing that to minority students.Across geography and time, human cultures have found common ground in their unease with things that are liminal – things that can’t easily be classed and thus neatly ordered. Mary Douglas writes about this in her 1966 anthropology classic, Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo, where she dissects cleanliness and uncleanliness, forbidden foods, and things that make us feel uneasy. These are things that straddle definitions, exist between two categories, like animals that parteth the hoof but cheweth not the cud.Philip Roth tells us why his main character in The Human Stain, Coleman Silk, decides to forsake his identity and pass for – become? – a white Jew. “All he’d ever wanted since earliest childhood was to be free: not black, not even white – just on his own and free.” But he can’t be just on his own and free, and so he decides that there is at least more freedom to be had by being white. Coleman Silk decides not to be liminal, not to be a walking, living taboo. Is passing an act of capitulation, or resistance? A rejection of identity, or of identification?The challenge and irony put before those who pass as white is that white is an unspoken norm. Successive waves of immigrants have arrived in the United States and acquired whiteness. The Irish needed not apply, but then they became white. Italians, ostracised and Catholic – they too became white.There is history and heritage in being Scottish or Swedish, Hungarian or Polish, or any other European ethnicity traditionally associated with white skin. White, though – is it anything other than a stand-in for power? A definition for something that needs not be defined, but simply is? Whiteness is never the identified half of a mixed identity. As a girlfriend once observantly pointed out, I have never, ever, reflexively referred to myself as “half-white”, a linguistic construction that is itself active, rather than just is. To paraphrase Larsen, it’s funny about whiteness – in order to claim it, passers have to racialise it, define it, give it some sort of mass and shape. They have to “act white”.But is it even possible to pin down an ontological whiteness?By April, Chad’s dry season, I had to lean my arm way down over the edge of the well, grasping the frayed ends of the rope with fingertips, in order to lower the leather sack down far enough to touch the surface of the water and slowly slip beneath. Dry season near the equator is a series of sun-forced strabismic glances. Months of cursing the sun and wiping your brow repeatedly, until you could swear that the skin there had been worn thin.One day just after the dry season had passed, after water had finally shot down from the sky with such force that it kicked sand up into the air and shook mangoes from trees, I was walking home from the market with two Chadian friends. We stepped to the side of the road to get out of the way of a motorcycle, whose driver sped by in a cloud of dust, his jellaba puffing out around him a chimera, fat with wind.Because we had moved, we were close enough to two little girls sitting on the side of the road to hear them speak. I couldn’t understand their Ngambay, but they were giggling.One of my friends burst into a big, open-mouth laugh. “Those girls,” he told me. “One said, ‘Look, there goes the nasara.’ And the other one said, ‘No, he’s not a nasara, he just looks like one. He’s really Chadian on the inside.’”This article was first published by Hazlitt, the online literary magazine.

Just a hint of a hint of certainty amid an ocean of vagueness might offer the faintest glimmer of hope. But all the prime minister can run to now is complete and utter despair. She has finally reached peak futility. Truly she is a leader for our times.It can’t go on like this for much longer. Something has to give. Even someone as semi-detached as the Maybot has a breaking point. She is well beyond the point where a simple reboot via the control-alt-delete keys can restore her to her factory settings. She is now experiencing such a total systems overload that she couldn’t begin to pass the Turing test.The prime minister more and more resembles the lone, almost silent hero of a spaghetti western, armed only with a water pistol. We all know it will end in a slow-motion finale, with a plaintive surround-sound Ennio Morricone score. And what makes it even more weird is that everyone will be rooting for her. It’s a bewildering irony that the entire country can empathise with a leader whose most striking feature is her lack of empathy.May arrived some 75 minutes late for her press conference at the end of an EU summit in which she had been humiliated yet again. The strain was evident. She was hunched – almost bent in two – and could only move in short, jerky movements. As if she was buffering. The spinning circle of doom might have been preferable. Her voice was in no better shape. She is now reduced to staccato croaks in which the words don’t even come out as intelligible sentences. The prime minister at her incoherent best.“Let me. Be ve. Ry clear,” she began, her eyes darting around the room for just one friendly face. What followed was little short of delusional, and reporters shifted uneasily in their seats. It’s not comfortable watching someone fall apart in front of your eyes. Especially when that person increasingly resembles Dr Strangelove and has their finger on the nuclear button.Up until now, the Brexit negotiations that were supposed to have been concluded last October – in order to give everyone enough time to sign off the deal – have been presented by May as quantum physics. Small movements forward, imperceptible to the naked eye. Now we were in the realms of homeopathy. There was no progress. Not even a trace of progress. We were down to the mere memory of progress. And all the stronger for it.The absence of the reassurances that the prime minister had been hoping to receive about the backstop were a sign of just how much the 27 EU countries were fully committed to offering those reassurances. The fact that Juncker had described her as nebulous was a mark of respect for her precision. It was time to focus on the focusing. To embark on the future relationship as if it actually existed rather than as just an illusion. We were lost in Cloud Nebulous. Blake’s 7 had better plot lines than this. And actors.Nor did her answers to questions provide any more clarity. The more frequently she said, “Let. Me be. Veryc. Lear,” the less sense she made. She had always been clear that the deal that had been negotiated was the only deal, which was why she had come back to the EU to tell them it was not up for renegotiation. It was time for the EU to stop asking for meaningless reassurances to the meaningless reassurances to the meaningless reassurances. She’d had enough of the 27 calling all these emergency EU summits. Either her deal got voted down or ... Or her deal got voted down. After that it was anyone’s guess.All May could say for certain was that she was very clear she had been very clear. At one point she tried to make a joke about what a crap week she’d had but no one laughed. The prime minister has no sense of comic timing and frightens people when she tries to smile. Apart from which, the situation had long since stopped being funny. We were seemingly stuck in purgatory, where we had been for the last two years, circling pointlessly with no end in sight. Even hell might be preferable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fbd6b39b02716a586e6ded881121dbc00fa466e/0_0_3780_3022/master/3780.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=77c76b379e882118aabdbaffc4da9019 1440w","title":"climate change young people cop24 conference","story":"At the COP24 conference, leaders lack the urgency felt by communities on the frontlines of a global threatAs wildfires burn, as temperatures rise, as the last remaining old-growth forests in Poland are logged, world leaders are in Katowice to negotiate the implementation of the Paris climate agreement. To outsiders, UN climate talks may seem like a positive step. Unfortunately, this is COP24.For 24 years, world leaders have annually talked at each other instead of to one another in hopes of reaching an agreement on how to mitigate the climate crisis. In all that time, they have barely scratched the surface of an issue that the world’s top climate scientists say we now have 12 years to stop – and that is an optimistic estimate.There’s an urgency in my heart being here in Katowice, knowing that this negotiation process is supposed to protect my generation and ones thereafter. I am afraid of the lack of accountability in the space, knowing that the people with power will be patted on the back for simply coming together without making meaningful policy commitments.When the news stories come out about successful negotiations, we forget about when leaders pushed to leave “human rights” out of policy wording, or stood on the floor advocating for fossil fuels as a solution (hint: they’re not), all to placate to their own interest in power and maintaining it. They are voluntarily blind to the suffering their decisions cause. Homes will be lost, families will be torn apart by displacement and at borders, and the sea will encroach upon whole societies, exterminating cultures and livelihoods. Developed countries like the US, corrupted by fossil fuel interests, are to blame.UN negotiators have been trying to solve the climate crisis since before I was born. When will global leaders admit that this is a broken and dysfunctional charade instead of burying the reality under false solutions and jargon? What will be the catalyst for people in power to do what is right? Do millions of people have to be displaced? Do we have to be stealing a livable planet from people not even born yet? How many millions of people will have to die from climate damage such as drought, famine, superstorms and wildfires before world leaders commit to implementing real solutions to defeat this crisis?I’ve been doing this work for five years and have given up a lot to do the things I know are right. I’ve given up personal finances, friendships, a normal adolescence and more to get up on the global stage. I’ve taken breaks from school, failed a few classes.Youth activists everywhere make personal sacrifices every day in order to protect the world we’ll inherit and our governments can’t do the same for us. The institutions meant to protect me don’t seem to care as much as I do and it’s a burden I carry everyday.I watch my government and governments around the world trade my future for profit. A future my mother fought hard to secure through sacrifice, when she made the journey to immigrate to the United States. There’s a lot of anger and depression inside of me because of this, but I found happiness and reward in seeing the solutions, power and love in the climate movement.Though political institutions have fallen short, being on the ground here does offer hope: it proves the strength of people power. Politicians will never be the core of this movement. We need to highlight and uplift genuine grassroots movements that properly address the lived experiences of the people they protect. We need to turn our attention and our energy into communities that are helping themselves in the best ways that they can.The marginalized communities on the frontlines know what it actually means to sacrifice in order to uphold future generations and young people. They understand giving up their own comforts to protect lives.We have called on our political leaders to demonstrate a similar understanding. But resilience can’t be taught, and it doesn’t come from a president, minister or monarch: it comes from the adversity you have faced. This is why, to fight the powers that hand away pieces of our environment for profit, we must enlist the people who have lived on the margins of society. People power will always be stronger than the people in power.Victoria Barrett is one of the 21 plaintiffs, aged 10 to 21, in the high-profile Juliana v the United States lawsuit, which faulted the US government for failing to protect its citizens from climate change. She represents marginalized voices at international conferences and has addressed the United Nations general assembly on the topic of youth involvement in its sustainable development goals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5592bf86b3de292b72a17e77eb8d53db7044bdbd/0_0_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0930552c1896590fc468ab87756190d5","title":"britains hostile environment is humiliating you can help people regain their dignity","story":"I was mentally and financially broken by trying to fight the Home Office. These charities helpFor me, the worst thing about battling the hostile environment was the loss of dignity. It wasn’t the lack of certainty, or even the fear that your life as you knew it could be taken away by a deportation order. It was that while you were navigating the immigration system and its arbitrary cruelty, you were humiliated. You were made to beg.So broken is the Home Office, so crippled by years of changing laws and poor funding, that once you have fallen foul of it, there is little reason or coherence to the process. And so you flail around, feeding it documents, attending its endless interviews, paying money into it with every application, with little confidence that it will do any good.I was in limbo for a year, fighting a residency renewal rejection that was then overturned, but only after it had exhausted my mental and financial resources. Those whose cases are being appealed are allowed to remain in the country pending resolution, but with their rights in a grey zone, a status that leaves them vulnerable. The effect it has on your life is comprehensive. Nothing is left unaffected. In that year, different parts of my existence over which I hitherto had full control were submitted, piecemeal, to others, to decide on and administer.My employment, tenancy, even renewal of something as trivial as a phone contract became precarious. There were excruciating moments: having a conversation with a boss or a landlord as they scrutinise your documents and you scrutinise their faces and body language for signs of your fate.I found myself adopting an apologetic, explanatory tone, trying to communicate in a simple brief manner the incoherence of the Home Office’s processes that meant that I wasn’t illegal, not an overstayer, but not fully legal either, because the system is designed to exhaust you into illegality so that it can then kick you out. Try explaining that to an estate agent impatiently flicking through your rent application. Every one becomes a border guard.You are forced to mine your life, laying it bare to an indifferent and under-resourced case worker, in order to prove your legitimate ties to the country. There are more embarrassing requests made to friends and work colleagues to write letters of support, to take time off to attend your hearing.There are more excuses to your employer, whose noblesse oblige is wearing thin, that you cannot come in to work again because you are chasing down yet another piece of paper from years ago that just might help your case. Your life becomes ruled by papers of the past, old slips and forms and letters and passports that you casually threw into a drawer or a suitcase and on which your whole future now rests.The hostile environment is less a formal structure and more an ever-shifting obstacle course with hidden trap doors, ones that you try to plug with paper – the criteria for which are also set up for failure. The sight of your name spelled differently in a document can spell disaster.Navigating the demands and hurdles of the hostile environment is not something that can be done alone. It is an all-consuming occupation that requires the resources of time, legal sophistication and money. I spent hours on message boards, reading the fine print of immigration laws and the decisions of judges on cases similar to mine.There were hours on the phone with an immigration lawyer, and then more hours with a litigation lawyer who was to argue my case in court, neither of whom at any point provided any reassurance or succour. This despite their experience they couldn’t trust the Home Office to make correct, even legal, decisions anymore.Then there were the hours that were lost to a state of vacant idle stress, unable to seek comfort in leisure, because always at the back of your mind there is the sense that you could be doing more, researching more, looking one more time for that one missing tax return which you have lost and HMRC cannot find.I was fortunate enough to have the funds to hire an immigration lawyer, but even then it took months and the process bankrupted me, despite the fact that she kindly often turned the clock off when the fees became too hefty, despite the fact that a second lawyer wrote off his fee entirely when he saw the state of my finances. I just about held on to my job because my employers were kind and patient.For those less fortunate, we know the process has resulted in homelessness, debt and destitution. As the Windrush scandal has shown, the humiliation has been accompanied by the cruel denial of rights, loss of a job or access to NHS services.In hindsight, I realise the process could have been made easier by the support of charities that I did not know existed until it was too late, organisations that devote themselves to helping people unfairly caught up in the hostile environment. These include charities supported by the  and Observer 2018 appeal: Praxis Community Projects, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Refugee and Migrant Centre Black Country and Birmingham, the Runnymede Trust and the Law Centres Network.

The latest work, funded by the mental health charity MQ: Transforming Mental Health, aims to turn these insights into a therapy.“Anxiety is really high in the autistic population,” said Garfinkel. “Fifty percent of people with autism also potentially have anxiety, which is so high and really not known.”The ability to tune into the activity of our internal organs is called interoception and there is emerging evidence that this ability is linked to how well a person is able to identify their own emotional state and to empathise with others.Garfinkel believes that altered interoception may be a factor in why autistic people experience the world differently. Her work has shown that autistic people tend to find it far harder to detect their own heartbeats – and the worse they are at this task, the greater their anxiety tends to be.The 120 trial participants are being asked to complete eight training sessions over several weeks. During training, their heartbeat is tracked using a pulse oximeter and they are asked to “listen in” to their heart and count how many beats occur in a set time period. They are then given the correct answer and the exercise is repeated.A pilot study involving participants without autism showed the training improved people’s interoceptive awareness and significantly reduced anxiety levels.Becka struggles to manage sensory overload, saying the world sometimes feels “intense, loud, fast, painful”, which she said contributes to feelings of stress and anxiety. Focusing on her heart and breathing is something she has learned to do naturally as a coping strategy and she enjoyed the training. “It was good to tune in and focus on my heartbeat,” she said. “No matter how busy outside or inside is, I can still focus on that.”Garfinkel’s interest was sparked after reading a scientific paper on autism and empathy.“I found within this paper an almost buried graph showing that if you measure the bodily response of someone with autism to seeing someone in pain, it’s actually greater,” said Garfinkel. “They have a heightened bodily response to the pain of others.”This finding runs counter to the idea that autistic people “lack empathy”, she said. “Early accounts of autism sometimes said they didn’t have empathy and for me that’s really not true at all,” she said.However, autistic people can feel disconnected from their own emotions and struggle to assess what people around them are feeling.“It made me wonder, if they’re having this very heightened bodily response, is there something altered about their interoception, their capacity to sense and use these signals?”One hypothesis is that, in autistic people, empathetic responses are occurring at the brain’s fast, instinctive level, reflected by changes in heartbeat. However, the brain may be less adept at interpreting these signals and so having these constant unexplained increases in heart rate could potentially leave people feeling under threat, causing anxiety.Garfinkel hopes the latest trial could provide further insights into whether the hypothesis, which is under active debate in the field, is correct. The participants will also have brain scans before and after training to look for any potential changes in a brain area called the insula, which picks up signals from the heart and is also involved in emotion.Sophie Dix, director of research at MQ: Transforming Mental Health, said: “This project has so much potential to inform treatments and further understanding of anxiety in autistic people. Research like this provides hope for better treatments for mental health kindled by our increased understanding of the link between the mind and the body.”2) Set a timer for one minute.3) Close your eyes and try to detect your heartbeat. When you’re ready, start the timer and try to count your heartbeats for a minute.4) Repeat the exercise, but this time feeling your pulse to take an accurate reading of your heart rate.Tip: if you’re struggling to tune into your heartbeat, try running up and down some stairs or doing star jumps until your heart pounds and then try to stick with it as it returns to normal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9a4cca91c3320fb5f0b05443fccf64e0d338a71/0_4_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19bae5a93cc740dfa06bc8d078c91408","title":"champions cup preview joey carbery munster george kruis saracens","story":"Wasps are without the injured back-rows Nathan Hughes and Brad Shields for their must-win encounter with pool leaders Toulouse.

Bath, who, who like Wasps, must win their return fixture against Leinster to have any realistic chance of reaching the quarter-finals, are without the injured Joe Cokanasiga so Cooper Vuna comes in. Johnny Sexton is named as Leinster’s captain despite concerns over a calf injury.Joey Carbery has been named to start for Munster at fly-half in their only change for the second part of their double-header against Castres. Carbery was named in the starting lineup for last weekend’s victory but pulled out with a hamstring injury and was replaced by JJ Hanrahan, who scored 20 points in the 30-5 home win. Munster begin round four top of the pool and victory against the Top 14 champions will take them a significant step closer to qualification. Castres make seven changes, introducing a new front row, while Rory Kockott comes in at scrum-half.Saracens welcome back George Kruis for his first appearance since suffering a calf injury during England’s autumn campaign for their trip to Cardiff. Kruis lines up alongside Will Skelton in the second row while Ben Earl is rewarded for his impressive showing from the bench last week with a start at No 8. Cardiff are boosted by the returns of the centres Willis Halaholo and Rey Lee-Lo as well as the openside flanker Josh Navidi. Glasgow, who can boost their chances of reaching the knockout with another victory over Lyon, make eight changes with Stafford McDowall making his first European start at inside-centre.Leicester make only one change to the side that lost an entertaining match at Racing 92 last weekend with Graham Kitchener coming back in, meaning Ben White continues at scrum-half in place of Ben Youngs. Gareth Owen returns to the bench for the Tigers, in place of the injured Matt Smith, who suffered a dislocated shoulder in Paris.

Last Saturday Exeter were desperately disappointed to lose at home to Gloucester in a result which appeared to have scuppered their European hopes. This time it was the Cherry and Whites who experienced a similar sinking feeling as Chiefs finally secured a relieving victory to throw Pool Two wide open.Munster and Castres will both have enjoyed this result, although Exeter’s last-gasp try bonus point may yet complicate the equation. The Chiefs had threatened not to capitalise on the platform established via first-half tries from the excellent Sam Skinner and Don Armand until tries in the final six minutes from Jack Yeandle and Harry Williams with Josh Hohneck in the sin-bin settled the outcome. Gloucester took a long time to find their rhythm and were twice reduced to 14 men but a brace of tries from the full-back, Jason Woodward, kept them in contention deep into the final quarter.The home team would have hoped for much better as they attempt to reach the Heineken Cup quarter-finals for the first time since 2007-08. This leaves them little margin for error, with wins over Munster and Castres now required in January for them to stand any chance of progressing. Nor was the evening a memorable one for Danny Cipriani who, in front of the watching England head coach Eddie Jones, was forced off two minutes before the interval after taking a knock to his right shoulder and arm. Sport is full of ifs and buts and Cipriani’s timing has not always been the best.With Jones in attendance on a chilly evening there was plenty at stake beyond mere pool points. Even with Cipriani off the field, Ollie Thorley for Gloucester and Exeter’s three front-row amigos Alec Hepburn, Ben Moon and Harry Williams, along with their teammates Armand and Jack Maunder, all had obvious incentive to impress beyond the usual west country bragging rights.For the Chiefs there was also the small matter of improving their poor away record in Europe which, prior to this fixture, had produced just four wins in 17 attempts. The only available escape route into this season’s last eight following no victories in their opening three pool games was to be positive and Gareth Steenson duly spurned four early kickable penalties in favour of driven mauls.The first three yielded nothing but the fourth was perfectly worked, with Skinner at the bottom of the heap. Steenson’s wide angled conversion was also spot on, rewarding the visitors for their first quarter dominance. One huge hit by Armand on Josh Hohneck was a further indicator of the Chiefs’ determination to atone for recent disappointments.Gloucester, slow out of the blocks, had no choice but to rouse themselves. Their pack made some menacing yardage and, with advantage being played, a long ball out to Jason Woodward on the left belatedly put the hosts on the scoreboard. Cipriani badly mishit his conversion attempt but the choristers in the Shed finally had an excuse to clear their throats.Rob Baxter, however, had spent all week urging the Chiefs to put the record straight. “The big question we have to ask as a group is why are we not getting our heads around the whole Heineken Cup thing yet?” stressed the director of rugby. Part of the solution clearly involved going back to basics and, following Cipriani’s departure, another trademark maul produced a try for Armand, converted by Steenson.With two thirds of first-half territory and possession and a favourable penalty count, the Chiefs’ half-time advantage of 14-5 was entirely deserved, particularly given the absence of several prominent forwards. There is no question they have missed Sam Simmonds’ energy and Luke Cowan-Dickie’s full-frontal physicality, with Jonny Hill, Dave Ewers and Ollie Woodburn among the other non-combatants.In Tom Lawday, however, they have a consistently hard-working number eight and only a professional foul by Billy Twelvetrees prevented Chiefs from adding a third try three minutes into the second half. No points were scored in Twelvetrees’ absence, however, and a second try by Woodward in the left corner at the start of the final quarter set up a frenetic if frozen-fingered finale. Tom Hudson gave Gloucester brief hope in the 76th minute but a poor clearance from Owen Williams in the final minute was smartly returned by Joe Simmonds and Williams crashed over in the final minute to put Exeter’s season back on track."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ff6fc1de72fbe55967c5503ee41abb2d8c7442/0_48_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f62f4b1973ee2554c287155f05850313","title":"yokozuna controversies and a dump truck a sumo history in pictures","story":"The origins of sumo date back 2,000 years and it was from the 17th century that saw its rise as a spectator sport.

The fiction within a fiction was itself inspired by the on- and off-stage bickering of husband and wife Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne during a production of The Taming of the Shrew. In Cole Porter’s classic musical – with book by another husband and wife team, Bella and Sam Spewack – Lunt and Fontanne’s counterparts are the recently orced director-producer-actor Fred Graham and his leading lady Lilli Vanessi. As Petruchio and Katherine tear strips off each other on stage, another battle is taking place in the wings.Theatre tends to revel in shows about shows, and this is no exception. As the pair of quarrelling thesps, Edward Baker-Duly and Rebecca Lock delight in the vanity and egotism of these two former lovers. Baker-Duly’s Fred is a particularly pompous creation, confident in his own genius yet entirely outshone by Lilli when they take to the stage. For the Shrew scenes, Janet Bird’s versatile design swiftly and comically transforms, with footlights sprouting out of the floor and garish backdrops swooping down from above.In the big set pieces, Paul Foster’s production excels. Another Op’nin, Another Show immediately captures the hurry and hubbub of the rehearsal room, moving bodies around the space in carefully choreographed chaos. Too Darn Hot – surely one of the best second act openers in musical theatre – oozes across the stage like melted butter, slowly heating to a fierce sizzle. Even in the chill of a Yorkshire winter, Matt Flint’s scorching choreography makes you feel the sweat of summertime Baltimore on your skin.Other numbers, though, fall a bit flat. Brush Up Your Shakespeare, one of the show’s big hits, lacks the wit and mischief that the song demands. As the double act of gangsters-turned-actors, Delroy Atkinson and Joel Montague gamely clown around the stage, but their delivery muffles much of Porter’s Bard-based punning. Elsewhere, though Lock furiously belts out the lyrics of I Hate Men, restricting her to a tabletop for most of the song strips the sentiment of any depth, reducing the physical comedy to various riffs on the hip thrust.Which brings us, inevitably, to the gender politics. In some ways, Porter and the Spewacks’ musical confronts and mocks the misogyny of Shakespeare’s play. In songs such as Bianca’s gleeful Tom, Dick or Harry and Petruchio’s I’ve Come to Wive It Wealthily in Padua, the marriage market and the commodification of women are roundly ridiculed. In this version, the Padua scenes are knowingly cartoonish, further enclosing Shakespeare’s plot within parodying quotation marks. And as LoisBianca, Amy Ellen Richardson is in absolute command of her character’s sexuality, which she both wields and relishes – especially in a glorious rendition of Always True to You in My Fashion.Still, there’s something a tad uncomfortable about watching a comedy that hinges on a woman acting under coercion, and closes with a song about wives’ obedience to their husbands. One gag essentially revolves around a man publicly beating a woman (really not funny), while the power of the female characters is still typically limited to their desirability. Foster’s production is certainly conscious of this, and tries hard to ensure that the women – especially Lock’s funny and ferocious Lilli – give as good as they get. But in an otherwise fun piece of festive frivolity, the treatment of women leaves a bitter taste on the tongue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc53aca11053a0fd7e00cf61c44ea045f887c5df/0_32_5568_3340/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da1b056f8c8aa0038a89a8b9805b761f","title":"facebook admits bug app developers hidden photos","story":"Bug let developers access pictures people had uploaded but chosen not to postA Facebook bug let app developers see photos users had uploaded but never posted, the social network has disclosed.For two weeks in September, an error in the way Facebook shares photos with third parties meant that apps could see not only photos users had posted on their newsfeed, but also pictures in other parts of the site – on Facebook Stories or Facebook’s Marketplace, for instance.The bug also “impacted photos that people uploaded to Facebook but chose not to post”, a Facebook developer, Tomer Bar, said in a statement on Friday.Importantly, the only applications that had access to the hidden photos were those to which users had already granted access to all their public photos, through the company’s API (application programming interface), Bar said. “Currently, we believe this may have affected up to 6.8 million users and up to 1,500 apps built by 876 developers.”Users affected are those who had given permission to third-party apps to access their photos through the Facebook login function. There is no evidence that the bug led to any large-scale extraction of photos from the site.“We’re sorry this happened,” Bar added. “Early next week we will be rolling out tools for app developers that will allow them to determine which people using their app might be impacted by this bug. We will be working with those developers to delete the photos from impacted users.”The error is comparatively minor given Facebook’s scale. In September, almost five times as many accounts were affected by a data breach in which hackers accessed personal information including name, relationship status, search activity and recent location check-ins.Guy Rosen, a Facebook vice-president, said at the time: “The vulnerability was the result of a complex interaction of three distinct software bugs and it impacted ‘view as’, a feature that lets people see what their own profile looks like to someone else. “It allowed attackers to steal Facebook access tokens, which they could then use to take over people’s accounts.

Remarkably, much of Thuringia’s cobbled streets and old stone architecture has barely changed since the time of Bach et al, so as well as touring the many museums devoted to these famous creative and intellectual figures, you have the opportunity to literally walk in their footsteps. Start right here ...Johann Sebastian Bach: baroque brought to lifeGermany’s greatest baroque composer was a jobbing musician throughout his life, and Thuringia is full of traces of his industrious career. Bach was an organist at Arnstadt, but his legacy is celebrated at the annual Thuringian Bach Festival in spring, and Eisenach (where he was born, in 1685) boasts the world’s biggest Bach museum. Housed in a splendid medieval building, the Bach House is devoted to the Bach dynasty – not only Johann Sebastian, but also his numerous musical relatives. The house is full of artefacts from Bach’s life and times, and each visit includes a short concert, played on original baroque-period instruments. If you’re a fan of classical music, you’ll also want to visit the Liszt House in nearby Weimar, where the great Hungarian composer Franz Liszt lived and worked.Martin Luther: the father of ReformationLuther spent his teenage years in Thuringia, first as a schoolboy in Eisenach, and then as a student at the University of Erfurt, graduating with an MA from its faculty of arts. While he was a student, Luther lived in Erfurt’s Augustinian Monastery (open to visitors – you can even stay the night). However, the most spectacular Luther site is Wartburg Castle, near Eisenach, where Luther hid, in disguise, from 1521 to 1522, and translated the New Testament into German – cementing the Reformation and establishing German as a national language. You can visit the room where Luther wrote his meisterwerk, where there used to be an ink stain on the wall – no longer visible – supposedly made when Luther threw an inkpot at the devil, who was trying to distract him.Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: the master of all tradesIt’s hard to overstate quite how important Goethe is to German culture. Poet, playwright, novelist, philosopher and scientist, his genius encompassed virtually every avenue of German intellectual life. Born in Frankfurt in 1749, he came to Thuringia as a young man, fresh from the success of his sensational first novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther, and spent time in Erfurt, Jena and Gotha, before settling in Weimar. The baroque house, where he lived for 50 years, until his death in 1832, is now the Goethe National Museum. There are lots of other sites associated with Goethe all over Thuringia, from the Liebhabertheatre in Kochberg Castle to the Botanical Garden in Jena.Lucas Cranach (Elder and Younger): Renaissance father and sonLucas Cranach is one of Germany’s most celebrated painters, and Thuringia is full of paintings by this Renaissance master and his son. Lucas the Elder was the better painter, but his son was almost as good, and their styles are so similar that it’s often hard to tell them apart. Born in 1472, Cranach the Elder settled in Weimar near the end of his life to live with his son’s family, and his adopted hometown is full of mementoes of his life and work. There are plenty of paintings by both Cranachs in Weimar’s Castle Museum, but the crowning glory is the magnificent altarpiece in the Church of St Peter \u0026amp St Paul, started by Cranach the Elder and completed by his son. If you’re travelling around Thuringia, don’t miss the Friedenstein Palace in Gotha and the city’s art museum in Erfurt, which both have fine Cranach collections, and St John’s Church in Neustadt an der Orla, with its precious altarpiece. However, the most atmospheric setting for Cranach’s moody masterpieces is Wartburg Castle, where Cranach’s good friend Martin Luther hid away. The castle contains several acute portraits of Luther by Cranach the Elder, as well as some intimate, perceptive studies of Luther’s parents and his wife.Walter Gropius: founder of BauhausModernist architect Walter Gropius was born in Berlin in 1883, but it was in Thuringia that he made his name. In 1919 in Weimar, he founded the Bauhaus – a revolutionary design school that transformed the way we live today. Gropius taught his students to work across a wide range of disciplines – from pottery to printmaking, and carpentry to ceramics. He taught them to throw out the chintz, to see that less is more. His house style was stark, minimal and, above all, practical. Everything he made was fit for purpose. His ideas have since become commonplace, but in the 1920s they were shocking. In 1925, local conservatives drove him out of Weimar, and when the Nazis came to power he was forced to flee abroad. Yet, here in Thuringia, his influence lives on. Next year, bauhaus museum weimar marks the centenary of the Bauhaus with a move to a smart new building – a fitting forum for the world’s oldest Bauhaus collection. There are plenty of other Bauhaus sites elsewhere in Thuringia, including the Haus Auerbach in Jena, built by Gropius, and a Bauhaus-era hotel, the Haus des Volkes, in Probstzella.Carl Zeiss: a new visionBorn in Weimar in 1816, Zeiss trained as a fine machinist in Thuringia, and in 1846 he opened a workshop in Jena, making telescopes, microscopes and other optical devices. By the time he died, in 1888, his little workshop had grown into a large factory. By the beginning of the first world war, it was the largest camera manufacturer in the world. After the second world war, the Soviets stripped the factory bare, and took much of the equipment back to Russia, but although it ended up behind the iron curtain, Zeiss held its own against western competition – and when Germany was reunified it was one of the few East German firms to survive and prosper as a viable concern. You can learn all about Zeiss at the German Optical Museum in Jena, then visit the nearby Zeiss Planetarium, fitted with state-of-the-art Zeiss telescopes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2023de63811aee4a9d67e5f9b10f3e4797ff3b14/0_54_1445_867/master/1445.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04d8faa07753c074dcaf2e59778857ab","title":"send us a tip on a uk winter walk for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"A good walk and fresh air are perfect for blowing away the Christmas cobwebs.

In the video, she said of Nie: “She’s so cute and she pretends to know so much English and then you ask her a question after having a whole conversation with her and she goes …” she said before mimicking a confused nod and smile.Then Summers makes fun of another contestant for not speaking English, apparently unaware that the language is not universally understood around the world.“Miss Cambodia is here and doesn’t speak any English and not a single other person speaks her language. Can you imagine?” she said. “Francesca said that would be so isolating and I said yes and just confusing all the time.”Colombia’s Valeria Morales and Australia’s Francesca Hung also appear in the videos laughing along with Summers.Among the many people on social media to register offense at the comments was the popular Instagram account Diet Prada whose repost of the video, taken from Morales’s account, has since gone viral.“This is basically what normalized xenophobia looks like,” they wrote. “If she’s trying to show empathy, the condescending, intolerant tone tells a different story. A reminder that you’re participating in a competition in a countrycontinent where English is NOT the primary language.”After a spate of backlash, Summers offered an apology on Friday.The Miss Universe competition “is an opportunity for women from around the world to learn about each other’s cultures, life experiences, and views,” she wrote. “We all come from different backgrounds and can grow alongside one another.”“In a moment where I intended to admire the courage of a few of my sisters, I said something that I now realize can be perceived as not respectful, and I apologize. My life, friendships, and career revolve around me being a compassionate and empathetic woman. I would never intend to hurt another.”Summers’ apology may be enough to stem the controversy but the entire ordeal is a reminder that it doesn’t matter how beautiful you are, the stereotype of the ugly American often holds true."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a31c7faf8cdd74b627b84dbc7ccf59dd50b63764/0_133_4290_2574/master/4290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=282edf4491eb67f4d8b429af83564aab","title":"australian government to recognise jerusalem as israels capital","story":"Prime minister Scott Morrison plans for embassy to leave Tel Aviv when city’s status is finalisedThe Australian government will formally recognise West Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, but the embassy will not be moved from Tel Aviv until the city’s status is finalised under a peace settlement.The prime minister, Scott Morrison, will announce the foreign policy shift in a speech to the Sydney Institute on Saturday, the Australian newspaper reports.The government will also commit to recognising a future state of Palestine with its capital in East Jerusalem after a settlement has been reached on a two-state solution.Morrison is also expected to say the more controversial relocation of the Australian embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem will be delayed until a peace settlement is reached.Palestinian leaders are already lobbying Arab and other Muslim states to drop Australian exports and withdraw their ambassadors from Canberra in the event of an embassy move to Jerusalem.While the embassy move is delayed, the government will establish a defence and trade office in Jerusalem and start looking for an embassy site.In October, Australia’s spy agency Asio warned any embassy move may “provoke protest, unrest and possibly some violence in Gaza and the West Bank”. When the US embassy opened in Jerusalem in May it sparked protests in Gaza which left 58 Palestinians dead and 1,200 wounded.In May, when the US moved its embassy to Jerusalem, it sparked massive protests in Gaza which resulted in the deaths of 58 Palestinians. Ever since Donald Trump’s declaration in December last year, Israel has been pushing hard to persuade other countries to follow.On Saturday the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, described Morrison’s announcement as “Trumpesque in its stupidity”.“Once again we are blindly following Donald Trump’s dangerous foreign policy agenda, with a decision that has already been near universally rejected – by the United Nations, European and Middle Eastern leaders and religious leaders,” Di Natale said.“Like the rest of the sensible international community, the Greens unequivocally condemn today’s decision. The best way to advance the prospect of peace in Israel and Palestine is to recognise a Palestinian state.”Morrison said he was “open to” to the move in October, describing it as a “sensible” proposal.An evangelical Christian, he immediately faced questions about whether his religious views had played a part in his decision to float the proposal. “My faith and religion has nothing to do with this decision,” he said.Instead, he argued the status quo in Israeli-Palestinian relations had failed to make headway. “The orthodoxy that’s driven this debate which says issues like considering the question of the capital are taboo. I think we have to challenge that,” he said.The government said the embassy proposal was flagged due to a vote on the UN general assembly resolution on the Palestinian Authority chairing the G77. But the byelection in Wentworth, once held by ousted PM Malcolm Turnbull, was also widely considered a factor.Phelps said at the time the policy was nothing more than “a politically motivated move”.Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e6472699d9f62562d2acd65e98b9485245af3bd/0_533_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43c0ad939786a4d471a28fb69e5e156d","title":"kosovo to create army in defiance of serbia and nato","story":"Parliament in Pristina backs formation of army despite criticism from NatoSerbia has talked up the possibility of an armed intervention in Kosovo after the parliament in Pristina overwhelmingly approved the formation of an army.Belgrade called the move the “most direct threat to peace and stability in the region”, while Nato’s chief said it was “ill-timed” and urged dialogue.All present 107 politicians in the 120-seat Kosovan parliament voted in favour of passing three draft laws to expand an existing 4,000 Kosovo security force and turn it into a regular, lightly armed army. Ethnic Serb politicians boycotted the vote.Serbia insists the new army violates a UN resolution that ended Kosovo’s 1998-99 war of independence. It has warned bluntly that it may respond with an armed intervention in the former province. The Serbian prime minister, Ana Brnabić, said this was “one of the options on the table”.The president, Aleksandar Vučić, visited Serbian troops on the border with Kosovo on Friday. Nikola Selaković, an adviser to Vučić, said Serbia could send in armed forces or declare Kosovo an occupied territory. The foreign minister, Ivica Dačić, said Serbia would seek an urgent session of the United Nations security council over the issue.In Serb-dominated northern Kosovo, the Serb leader Goran Rakić said the new army was “unacceptable” and “showed clearly that Pristina does not want peace.” Rakić urged Serbs in Kosovo to show “restraint and not respond to provocations”.In a sign of defiance, Serbs in the north displayed Serbian flags on streets and balconies, while Nato-led peacekeepers were deployed on a bridge in the ethnically ided northern town of Mitrovica.Russia’s foreign ministry denounced the Kosovan move and said the army must be disbanded.Any Serbian armed intervention in Kosovo would mean a direct confrontation with thousands of Nato-led peacekeepers, including US soldiers, stationed in Kosovo since 1999.Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, a move not recognised by Belgrade or its ally Russia, and tensions have remained high between the two sides.Nato and the European Union, which has led years-long talks to improve ties between the Balkan neighbours, expressed regret that Kosovo had decided to go ahead with the army formation.“I reiterate my call on both Pristina and Belgrade to remain calm and refrain from any statements or actions which may lead to escalation,” said Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general.The army will preserve its current name, Kosovo Security Force, but will have a new mandate. In about a decade the army expects to have 5,000 troops and 3,000 reservists, and a €98m annual budget. It will handle crisis response and civil protection operations – essentially what the current paramilitary force, which is lightly armed, does. Its main tasks will be search and rescue, firefighting and disposal of explosive ordnance and hazardous material.It was not immediately clear how much more equipment or weapons the army will have.Serbia fears the move’s main purpose is to chase the Serb minority out Kosovo’s north, a claim strongly denied by Pristina.The US reaffirmed its support for “the gradual transition … to a force with a territorial defence mandate, as is Kosovo’s sovereign right.”The Kosovan war ended with a 78-day Nato air campaign in June 1999 that halted a Serbian crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfdc50817d11b57e1279735d85a5fdcc1048b317/245_518_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c56edf7eb81dc2983fb47c3897fdb407","title":"tusk accuses mps of showing lack of respect for theresa may","story":"European council president hits out at UK parliament over failure to back Brexit dealDonald Tusk has accused MPs of showing a lack of respect for the British prime minister as the EU turned its fire on the Commons over its failure to back the Brexit deal.As he closed a summit in Brussels, the European council president took aim at treatment meted out to Theresa May, who faced a challenge to her leadership on the eve of the leaders’ meeting.“We have treated Prime Minister May with the greatest respect, all of us, and we really appreciate the efforts by the prime minister to ratify our common agreement,” Tusk said. “My impression is that in fact we have treated prime minister May with a much greater empathy and respect than some MPs, for sure.”Earlier in the day, May had confronted the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, accusing him of calling her “nebulous” in a press conference.Juncker said the row had been a misunderstanding, adding that he had been describing the “overall state of the debate in Britain”.“I was following the debate in the house and I can’t see where the British parliament is heading at and that’s why I was saying it’s nebulous,” he said.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the Brexit deal was now “in the hands of the British parliament” and called on MPs to take a clear position on whether to accept or reject it. “This agreement, I believe, is truly good for both parties and it is the only one possible,” he said.May faces an uphill battle to persuade MPs that the Northern Ireland backstop contained in the withdrawal agreement would not trap the UK in a permanent customs union.She has pinned her hopes on a last-ditch effort to persuade the European Union to work with her in devising a legal guarantee, known as a “joint interpretative instrument” that would put a duty on both sides to try to get out of the Irish backstop within 12 months of it coming into force.Secret negotiations between May’s Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins, and senior EU officials had teed up the leaders on Thursday evening to issue a statement assuring the UK that the backstop would only ever be temporary.They were also due to offer future assurances on hearing from the prime minister but that pledge was taken out of the statement at a late dinner, on the demand of a large number of member states, including Ireland, France, Denmark, Belgium and Spain.On Friday, the EU’s leaders avoided questions from reporters about the possibility of answering May’s calls for a legal instrument to convince her MPs back home of both sides’ intentions on the backstop.Asked three times whether the UK could get further concessions or legally binding assurances that go beyond the current agreement, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, declined to suggest another offer would be forthcoming.“The 27 member states have given assurances, they are contained in the conclusions of yesterday evening,” she told reporters. “So that is our position, that is what we have put on the table and now we expect Great Britain to respond.”EU leaders think the summit communique already has legal weight. It is “not just a sheet of paper, but these are conclusions of the 27 member states”, Merkel said.The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said the EU could not put a date by which the UK would exit the backstop. He said: “Obviously we want to be as helpful as possible … but there are limitations to that.”Tusk said he would not negotiate with May over a legal guarantee, but that he would be available to her over the Christmas period. “I have no mandate to organise any further negotiations”, he said. “We have to exclude any kind of reopening our negotiations on the withdrawal agreement. But of course we will stay here in Brussels, and I am always at prime minister Theresa May’s disposal.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Severe winds and heavy rain to sweep across the countryFBI says US-Irish citizen is wanted to face trial over sexual exploitation and transportation of a minorPrimates emphasise that having a home gives humans a sense of \u0026lsquopersonal dignity\u0026rsquoAbsence of consistency leading tenants to believe system subject to \u0026lsquopolitical patronage\u0026rsquoCourt hears man said \u0026lsquoI didn\u0026rsquot do it\u0026rsquo after he was charged with assault causing harmThe 22-acre site at Haulbowline Island will open to the public next MayJudge imposes further 10-year sentence, with final six years suspendedSpending increase necessary to deliver state-of-the-art facility, Minister saysFemale TDs endure sexist remarks, comments on their dress and macho cultureExpert witness agrees there was evidence of heavy braking for 10m to 13m before collisionQuote described as \u0026lsquooutrageous\u0026rsquo and a tax on rural IrelandGlyposate exposure levels were just 1 per cent of accepted European norms, NUI Galway study findsWe can\u0026rsquot have guarantees and assurances that contradict agreed treaty \u0026ndash TaoiseachClaire McGrath tells court she always loved Keith Connorton who is accused of stabbing Graham McKeever at Tallaght apartmentCourt dismisses applications from the two rugby players who were acquitted in March 2018Family of Liam Murray, shot dead at his Dublin home, unhappy with coroner\u0026rsquos decision not to give them copy of garda fileUS continues \u0026lsquoto hang around like a bad smell\u0026rsquo at climate talks, says Christian Aid spokesmanPatron of the organisation comments on child sex abuse scandal"},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Eventually he got a quote for €7,000, which would have made such a service economically unviable.He was later contacted by young drivers to state that they were being quoted between €4,000 and €8,000 for car insurance, in many cases a multiple of what the car was worth.“It’s not right. There are no trams, buses or Luas lines in north Leitrim. Car transport is essential in rural Ireland. There are two cars in most houses. A lot of people travel to Sligo or Carrick-on-Shannon for work,” he said.Cllr Fallon said he received a call from the teenager who had been quoted nearly €19,000 for insurance after highlighting the cost of insurance for young drivers.“I said to him, ‘did you have an accident? Do you have a clean licence?’ He told me that he did,” he said.Cllr Fallon said he had seen a copy of the insurance quote but the teenager involved did not want to be named.“He still wants to get insurance somewhere,” he said. “How is he going to learn or gain experience if he can’t get insurance?”Cllr Fallon pointed out that some insurance companies are offering lower premiums if motorists do a limited amount of mileage. However, iniduals are finding it hard to remain within those limits in rural Ireland.Insurance Ireland said insurers make decisions based on driver’s experience, the type of vehicle, its engine size and its age, but the weighting of each is a factor for each company.The representative body for the industry said it cannot comment on inidual cases, but added that the biggest cost factor in motor insurance is the cost of the claims paid by insurers."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3731829.1544820279!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the ebbing patience with the british is now almost palpable in brussels","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May took exception to Jean-Claude Juncker’s comments. Their exchange was captured on camera. “You called me nebulous!” she complained The Government jet is out of action, so Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his senior officials had to travel on the Aer Lingus red-eye on Thursday morning. There’s Leo, whispered Row Four. Leo was in Row Two. The  kept an eye on things from Row Three.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin was also on the flight, so naturally serendipity seated him beside the Taoiseach’s chief-of-staff Brian Murphy, to the amusement of everyone except the two men.The Taoiseach was seated next to an elderly lady who had forgotten her medication. Airline staff were concerned about her, repeatedly asking was she able to fly without it. But luckily Dr Varadkar’s skills were not required. By the time the summit finished, it was the prospect of an orderly Brexit that needed first aid.In the summit building a long red carpet leads to the entrance where EU leaders sweep past a throng of journalists and cameras, most stopping for a few words with their national media. Most of the questions were about Brexit. Most of the answers were the same: This is the deal. It will not be changed. The backstop stays. Such was the level of support for the Irish backstop that Jean-Claude Juncker wore a green tie, officials said. Honestly. Behind closed doors the Taoiseach was meeting with the British prime minister. It went on for longer than usual – 50 minutes, aides reported – but it was not, apparently, an easy meeting. The two do not have brilliant relationship, to put it mildly. It did not improve on Thursday. Asked about it, Varadkar said some of Mrs May’s suggestions were acceptable, some weren’t. He didn’t elaborate.Down on the floor of the cavernous atrium that serves as a gigantic press room for the occasion, summit junkie Nigel Farage, Mr Brexit himself, was dispensing wit and wisdom to all media comers. Even the ebullient Farage seems to be getting tired of Brexit summits. Yet he kept his end up in a series of spirited interviews. “What do you want, Nigel?” the BBC interviewer asked, almost plaintively. “I want Brexit!” thundered Nigel.The next bit of the conversation didn’t happen, but it’s the one that has been reverberating around British politics for two years, transfixing Westminster, gluing up its government, destroying its second prime minister now, reordering the landscape. And what does Brexit mean, Nigel? Brexit means Brexit.Outside the summit venue, at a safe distance a block away, protesters were having a sit-down protest against a lack of government action on climate change. It was a cold day for it. Nearby Micheál Martin was doing the national interest thing, expressing firm support for the Government’s position in defence of the backstop. Micheál was anxious too to advertise his own credentials as a European statesman, having just come from the Alde group of European liberals (not to be confused with Aldi, another important European institution). Micheál related that he was “meeting with the prime ministers of the Alde group, chaired by Mark Rutte there. From Holland. Four commissioners there. Vince Cable was there.” Not even the Liberal Democrats think Vince Cable is a big name. Back inside things were taking a turn for the worse. Mrs May’s presentation to the 27 heads of government was not going well. They wanted to know two things, according to subsequent briefings – what did she want, and if she got it, could she get the treaty through Westminster? Satisfactory responses to the questions were not, it seems, forthcoming. After Mrs May left the meeting, the EU 27 took out parts of the draft conclusions, including a promise to provide further help and clarifications to Mrs May – a move inevitably interpreted as an aggressive move in British reports.At his press conference on Friday, Varadkar explained the move by saying the leaders felt there were enough assurances already for Mrs May. But the London Times quoted a senior EU official as saying that the UK needed to “feel the bleak midwinter”. “The feeling is that EU leaders will have to do more for her!” bellowed one British journalist down the phone. That wasn’t the sense that they had. Not yet, anyway. The ebbing patience with the British is almost palpable in Brussels now“This debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise,” said Jean-Claude Juncker, European Commission president, at a post-summit press conference which took place after midnight on Thursday. “When it comes to the future relationship, our British friends need to say what they want, rather than asking us what we want.”When they met again the following morning, Mrs May took exception to his comments. Their exchange was captured on camera. “You called me nebulous!” she complained. Junker explained that he was not talking about her, but rather about the British debate, and that in any case, his word was mistranslated. He meant the debate was nebuleux – foggy. She accepted his explanation, but as an example of the British incomprehension of how the EU works, reaches decisions and sticks together it was pretty apt. At her end of summit press conference, Mrs May was asked by one journalist if she ever felt like “throwing your phone in the bin and moving to a remote island”. The ways things are going, that’s exactly what she will do. Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Yves HermanReutersEU leaders last night delivered a pointed snub to beleaguered British prime minister Theresa May.They gave her political assurances that they see the backstop as a temporary measure, but refused to craft a legally binding declaration to that effect as she had sought. The leaders removed from a draft of the European Council conclusions a suggestion that they were “ready to examine whether any further assurance can be provided”.The amendment does not mean that they will not provide such assurances, but, as European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said “it is up to the British government to say what they want”.It is expected that London will want to return in January with proposed wording for consideration by the council of any protocol, declaration, or clarification which it might like attached to the withdrawal treaty.The leaders did provide some comfort to May. The conclusions say that they “stand ready to embark on preparations immediately after signature of the Withdrawal Agreement to ensure that negotiations can start as soon as possible after the UK’s withdrawal. . . It is the union’s firm determination to work speedily on a subsequent agreement that establishes by 31st December, 2020, alternative arrangements, so that the backstop will not need to be triggered.“The European Council also underlines that, if the backstop were nevertheless to be triggered, it would apply temporarily, unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement that ensures that a hard border is avoided.”The text adds the explicit reference to the avoidance of a hard border. “In such a case,” the conclusions continue, “the union would use its best endeavours to negotiate and conclude expeditiously a subsequent agreement that would replace the backstop, and would expect the same of the United Kingdom, so that the backstop would only be in place for as long as strictly necessary.”The draft was also amended to remove from that last sentence a reference to only being “in place for a short period” – the deletion reflects sensitivities by the Irish among others to any suggestion that the backstop would be time-limited.They said that they wish to establish as close as possible a partnership with the United Kingdom in the future. And the leaders emphasised the need to step up “work on preparedness at all levels for the consequences of the UK’s withdrawal to be intensified, taking into account all possible outcomes.” With or without a deal.Echoing\u0026nbspJuncker’s sentiments Danish prime minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen on his way out of the meeting placed firm responsibility for the next step on the House of Commons.“Someday – somebody needs to say it. And you have to say – openly – that it is necessary that you get some homework done in the British parliament which has handled this challenge very different to what Denmark did, when the Danes voted No to Maastricht or as the Irish did when they voted No to Lisbon.“In both countries someone took the responsibility on them to decide what do we do.

Photograph: Jasper JuinenBloombergTheresa May’s attempt to rescue her Brexit deal ran into serious trouble in Brussels on Thursday night, after despairing EU leaders accused her of having no viable proposals to sell her plan to a hostile British parliament.The British prime minister, already wounded after more than a third of her MPs voted to oust her in a confidence vote, arrived at a European Council meeting to a warm reception from EU leaders who want to salvage the Brexit deal.But during an hour-long presentation, Mrs May succeeded in alienating many fellow leaders after making a series of ambitious proposals to appease her domestic critics, including a one-year time limit on the Irish backstop.After Mrs May left the room, many leaders were despondent. During more than two hours of talks over dinner, EU leaders agreed to scrap plans for a formal process to provide reassurances to Britain until Mrs May decided what she wants.“This debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise,” said Jean-Claude Juncker, European Commission president. “When it comes to the future relationship, our British friends need to say what they want, rather than asking us what we want.”A video of Mr Juncker and Mrs May later emerged appearing to show a tense confrontation during the summit on Thursday. Michel Barnier, EU chief Brexit negotiator, claimed that Mrs May was not seeking reassurances but was reviving old ideas rejected during Brexit negotiations. One EU diplomat briefed on the talks said Mrs May was “unprofessional”.Another EU diplomat claimed that there was even a suggestion that it might have been better if Mrs May had been ejected from Downing Street in this week’s abortive coup by Tory Eurosceptics. “She didn’t know what she wanted,” the diplomat said. Mrs May insisted during her presentation that she could change the “dynamic” at Westminster and overcome a wall of hostility in her ruling Conservative party towards her compromise plan.She urged the EU27 to offer a legal tweak that would, in effect, put a one-year time limit on the Irish backstop, which is seen by Eurosceptic MPs as a “trap” to keep the UK in a permanent customs union.But her presentation, which also included a suggestion that the non-binding political declaration on future UKEU relations should be given a legal footing as an annexe to the legal withdrawal treaty, went down badly.“It was Salzburg all over again,” said another EU diplomat, referring to the acrimonious summit in September.While Mrs May battled to save her deal and her job in Brussels, Tory Eurosceptics called for her resignation, brushing aside the prime minister’s victory by 200 votes to 117 in Wednesday’s bruising vote of confidence. Mrs May was forced to abort a planned Commons vote on her Brexit deal this week, rather than face a heavy defeat, and now has a tough job to persuade the EU that she has realistic proposals to salvage it.Addressing a European Council dinner, Mrs May said: “There’s a majority in my parliament who want to leave with a deal. With the right assurances this deal can be passed. Indeed, it’s the only deal that can get through my parliament.”Sebastian Kurz, chancellor of Austria and current holder of the EU presidency, suggested that another EU summit on Brexit could be needed in January, although after last night’s dinner all preparations are on hold.In a sign of the concern among the EU27, draft summit conclusions were rewritten to remove the observations that the backstop did not represent a desirable outcome for the EU and would be in place only for a short period. Another paragraph, saying the union stood “ready to examine whether any further assurance can be provided” on the backstop, was cut entirely. One diplomat said that despite general goodwill towards Mrs May, she “didn’t get anything, basically”.Although Mrs May urged her colleagues to “trust my judgment”, faith in the British prime minister’s political nous has been badly shaken by recent events, especially her spectacular failure this week to persuade her own party to back her Brexit deal.To increase the pressure on Mrs May, the European Commission will prepare a raft of new contingency plans on December 19th for a “no deal” exit.At a tense meeting before the summit Leo Varadkar warned Mrs May against seeking any substantial changes to the backstop.Mrs May conceded that she was not expecting an “immediate breakthrough” at the two-day summit, as she prepares to present a revised deal to a hostile parliament ahead of a self-imposed deadline of January 21st.Number 10 said after Thursday night’s meeting that the EU was privately insisting that talks on “reassurances” over the Irish backstop had not been ruled out.“We must get this right,” Mrs May said. “Let’s hold nothing in reserve. Let’s work intensively to get this over the line for the interests of all our people.”The summit has exposed a difference in tone among European leaders in their approach to Mrs May, with Mark Rutte, Dutch prime minister, and Angela Merkel, German chancellor, keen to work closely with Britain to secure an orderly withdrawal. - Financial Times Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Geert VandenAPTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that there are “limitations” to any assistance to what the EU can offer the British Prime Minister Theresa May to help her get the withdrawal treaty passed.Mr Varadkar said that he and other EU leaders wanted to be as helpful as possible to Mrs May in her attempts to get the withdrawal treaty through Westminster, “but there are limitations to that”.“We can’t get into a situation where we’re contradicting anything that is in the legal text of the treaty that’s been agreed,” he told a press conference after the conclusion of the EU summit in Brussels today.Mr Varadkar said there was no agreement on what clarifications or declarations or assurances that Mrs May might want, echoing a frustration with the British prime minister evident among other EU leaders over the two-day meeting which was, once again, dominated by Brexit. Mr Varadkar stressed the EU’s wish to help Mrs May, but added: “That is contingent on her understanding that there are limitations.” Earlier, Mrs May acknowledged it will not be possible to reopen the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement to alter the backstop provisions which have sparked mass rebellion among Conservative MPs. She said Britain would have have talks with the EU over the coming days about how to obtain “further assurances” which might persuade MPs to back the deal.In a press conference at the end of the European Council summit in Brussels, Mrs May said she had a “robust” discussion with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.She insisted she had been “crystal clear” about the UK’s need for firmer assurances that the backstop cannot become permanent. Video footage of the conversation showed a clearly angry Mrs May apparently berating Mr Juncker for saying that her address to leaders of the 27 remaining states on Thursday evening had been “nebulous”. Mrs May welcomed the official conclusions issued by the EU27 which committed the EU to trying to get a post-Brexit trade deal agreed quickly enough to avoid the need for a backstop to keep the Irish border open.“The EU is clear, as I am, that if we are going to leave with a deal, this is it,” she said.Mrs May’s hopes of a legally binding commitment on the backstop from the EU27 were dashed on Thursday, when Mr Juncker said there could be “no real changes” to the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated over 18 months.Meanwhile, British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “The last 24 hours have confirmed that Theresa May’s Brexit deal is dead in the water. “The Prime Minister has utterly failed in her attempts to deliver any meaningful changes to her botched deal. Rather than ploughing ahead and dangerously running down the clock, the Prime Minister needs to put her deal to a vote next week so Parliament can take back control,” Mr Corbyn said. - Additional reporting PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

She said the official conclusions of a meeting of the other 27 leaders, which had been amended to remove a promise of further reassurances on the Northern Ireland backstop, represented progress.\u0026nbsp“Those take us forward. Those are welcome. This is the clearest statement we have had yet from the European Union that it is their intention for the backstop never to be necessary, that it is their intention to ensure that if it were necessary it was only temporary and that it’s their intention to work quickly with us once we’ve seen the deal being agreed in parliamentary terms, that they will work quickly with us to ensure that we start those negotiations about a future partnership,” she said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe prime minister postponed a vote in parliament on the Brexit deal this week after it became clear it would be defeated heavily. But she said she was confident she could win further reassurances from the EU on the backstop before bringing the vote back to parliament next month.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMrs May was seen admonishing Mr Juncker before the start of Friday’s session at the summit, after he had described her presentation to the leaders the previous evening as “nebulous”. She said afterwards that she had been “crystal clear” in her presentation and that Mr Juncker had explained his remark.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“I had a robust discussion with Jean-Claude Juncker. I think that’s the sort of discussion you’re able to have when you’ve developed a working relationship and you work together. And what came out of that was his clarity that when he used that particular phrase he’d been talking about the general level of debate. I had further conversations with him through the morning,” she said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGerman chancellor Angela Merkel said\u0026nbspit was essential that there would be no renegotiating or amendment of the withdrawal agreement, the single market is guaranteed and the Belfast Agreement is preserved.She said the statement in the official conclusions about the backstop were what the EU 27 had to offer in terms of reassurance but she did not rule out making further clarifications.\u0026nbsp“These are the assurances we have given to the British prime minister. Now we await her response,” she said.\u0026nbsp”We want to be helpful, but within the framework I have been describing. We don’t want to amend the withdrawal agreement and we will have to continue to work on the future relationship anyway. So we have explained that to Theresa May.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Staff were said to be astonished when Lineker was allowed to appear on stage at a rally last month calling for a second referendum.“Never mind the small print on the editorial guidelines - they state that whatever we say or write can have an influence. Gary is extremely influential, with seven million Twitter followers. He’s running a political campaign and it’s not right,” said one presenter.Another said: “The rest of us couldn’t possibly go and tweet about Brexit without being hauled over the coals. But there’s this feeling that it’s Gary, and therefore he can do it.”Earlier this year, members of the BBC Women group were prevented from discussing equal pay on air because they had publicly expressed solidarity with Carrie Gracie, the former China editor who was found to be paid less than male colleagues.They included Jane Garvey, presenter of Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour, who tweeted yesterday: “As I understand it, Gary does sport so he can talk politics. I talk about women and I can’t talk about politics but I can talk about #women and even #EqualPay as long as I don’t talk on the BBC about #EqualPay (or the lack of it) at the BBC. Couldn’t be clearer.”BBC insiders said that Lineker’s status as a freelancer meant the corporation has little control over what he says on his personal Twitter account.The issue came to the fore after Jonathan Agnew, the cricket correspondent and Test Match Special veteran, wrote online: “Gary. You are the face of BBC Sport. Please observe BBC editorial guidelines and keep your politial views, whatever they are and whatever the subject, to yourself. I’d be sacked if I followed your example.”After the BBC published a lengthy piece yesterday explaining why Lineker was not breaching guidelines, the presenter tweeted: “Oh dear, looks like I don’t need to stick to football. My deepest apologies in advance.”Please review our commenting policyComment: Brexiteers chasing a will-o’-the-wisp perfect deal need to re-evaluateComment: Theresa May has shown resilience, but has too strong a sense that she is rightDeadly rose virus which could wipe out British flowers is likely to come to UK, RHS says as it backs project to sequence DNA Jeremy Corbyn urged to call vote of no confidence in Theresa May next week as his party grows restlessEU migrants will have to earn £30,000 before coming to Britain under crackdownStacey Dooley to be Strictly\u0026#39s biggest winner as audience approval sets her up for flagship BBC roleComment: A no-deal Brexit is more likely than not.

But the guide on how to maintain a gleaming abode has been given a modern makeover as a cleaning-mad Instagram star, who was unknown just nine months ago, has won a lucrative book deal after a “heated” bidding war by 11 publishers.Known to her 1.4 million Instagram followers as Mrs Hinch, Sophie Hinchliffe is a 28-year-old hairdresser whose videos of her cleaning her humble Essex home have amassed hundreds of thousands of fans in a matter of months.  She has now set to write her first book called Hinch Yourself Happy: All The Best Cleaning Tips To Shine Your Sink and Soothe Your Soul, which promises to offer readers clever cleaning tips for not only a cleaner house, but a calmer you.Her “incredibly loyal” fans, who call themselves ‘The Hinch Army’, have even coined a new term for cleaning - “hinching”.The world rights to Mrs Hinch’s new book were acquired by Michael Joseph publishers, part of the Penguin group, and they are positioning it as “one of their biggest books for 2019.”Mrs Hinch, whose full name is Sophie Hinchliffe, has attracted 1.4 million followers to her Instagram page that features videos of her cleaningFenella Bates, a publisher at Michael Joseph, described Mrs Finch as “a one-woman cleaning phenomenon”.She said: “In the last month and a half, Mrs Hinch has gained a million followers on Instagram. But this book will be about much more than cleaning.“Sophie has openly spoken about suffering from anxiety in the past and has explained how vital cleaning has been for her recovery.”Fans of Mrs Hinch have described her Instagram page as “a support mechanism”, with one user commenting on a post: I suffer with bad anxiety and panic attacks and, believe it or not, the only thing that helps ground me through a bad bout of anxiety is \u0027hinching’”.Her unexpected fame has also been attributed to a new online trend, known as autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR), where users watch videos of people performing “relaxing” activities, such as cleaning, painting or whispering.Dr Giulia Poerio, from the University of Sheffield’s Department of Psychology, conducted research on ASMR earlier this year and found that people who experience it show consistent reductions in their heart rate when they are watching the videos.She said: “It’s the nature in which the task is done. Watching someone do methodical tasks in a careful way and the instructional element of watching them do it is what would be triggering for someone who experiences ASMR.”An Instagram post from Mrs Hinch, showing her immaculate cleaning skills that have generated huge popularityThe hugely popular Mrs Hinch follows in the footsteps of Shirley Conran, whose cleaning manual ‘Superwoman’ published in 1975 was hailed as a “historic volume” that was “full of valuable tips”.One of the first cleaning manuals published in the UK is understood to be Mrs. Beeton’s Book of Household Management, which was originally printed as 24 newspaper columns from 1859 to 1861.Now, over 150 years later, Mrs Hinch’s Instagram brand is the latest cleaning phenomena to work its way into a large number of British homes.After announcing her book at 7pm on 12 December 2018, the book went to number two on the Amazon book chart overnight with 7,469 pre-orders, falling just behind Michelle Obama’s memoir, Becoming.Andrew Bloch, founder of the leading PR firm Frank, described the 11-way auction of Mrs Hinch’s book as “incredible”, adding: “She has found a gap in the market and has been able to identify a niche that reaches a younger generation through social media in a way that’s aspirational and amusing.“She has developed a lot of incredibly loyal followers too.“There’s plenty of Instagram influencers that great their own hype and have big numbers, but there is very little substance behind them.

As a result, rents are expected to rise “modestly” over the next year, RICS said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That Mike Ashley. Has the FT taken leave of its senses? The same title that exposed the scandal of the macho bad behaviour surrounding the Presidents Club dinner now praising the business boss who vomited into a fireplace after consuming 12 pints in a pub during a management meeting?Actually, the FT is right. The source of the applause was the memo Ashley sent to the Debenhams board, expressing anger at their refusal of a £40m interest-free loan and equity injection from his Sports Direct chain, the department store group’s biggest shareholder. In no uncertain terms, Ashley maps out the lie of the land for the Debenhams directors. It’s not pretty: “November was the worst November for retailers in living memory the market is saying Debenhams has no credit insurance advisers and banks are telling suppliers they should not trade with the firm at a level above which they can afford to lose suppliers are managing themselves out of stores product is being discounted to try and realise some cash.” And, says Ashley, with a final flourish: “Additionally, it is speculated that the company currently has a zero chance of survival.”Sports Direct boss issues warning to Debenhams in leaked letterCan Mike Ashley turn around the high street when no one else is tryingMike Ashley tells MPs: ‘The internet is killing the high street’Mike Ashley ‘demands’ meeting with MPs to discuss high street crisisPhew. That’s telling them. And that’s the point. Because too few senior business people tell it how it is, for fear of provoking upset and spoiling relationships. Too many of their advisers seek to please, not help. The result is that they carry on existing in a bubble. Decisions that should be taken aren’t, boards do not confront reality, and instead, carry on their sweet way. Opportunities to act, to do something, are lost, with the result that when the C-suite does decide to move it’s often too late. For injecting a dose of reality into proceedings, and, hopefully, making the Debenhams top brass sit up and see sense, Ashley deserves much credit. At the very least, they cannot maintain they were not made aware. His straight-talking is commendable and authoritative – Ashley, don’t forget, is immersed in retail, and is grappling on a daily basis with the same landscape that is confronting Debenhams.It would be disastrous if the time-honoured establishment reaction to the likes of Ashley, of labelling him as an upstart, as someone not to be taken seriously, was pursuedIt’s Ashley as well, as the head of an empire that along with Sports Direct includes lingerie firm Agent Provocateur, Evans Cycles, luxury fashion chain Flannels, the House of Fraser department stores, and major holdings in Debenhams and French Connection, who is warning loudly about the dire future facing the high street. Rising rents and growing popularity of online shopping paint a bleak prospect, one that he says could be improved by a tax on firms who generate 20 per cent of their revenues from the internet.As with Debenhams, Ashley does not pull his punches, telling MPs, the high street is heading for extinction\u0026nbspunless radical action was taken and warning them: “I’m not Father Christmas.”I never imagined I’d write this: we need more Mike Ashleys. Not the bad boy Ashley, but the one who is prepared to speak out, to stand up and to be counted.What’s striking is just how few major retailers are prepared to voice their fears and frustrations. We’re entering a season of renewed woe in the industry, of yet more dismal sets of results and closures – but the silence, the sense of inertia, will be resounding.In private, they’re all complaining and moaning like mad. But, hidebound by conservatism, afraid of rocking the boat, of drawing attention to themselves and somehow being seen as in trouble, they’re saying very little in public.The result is that it’s not just the directors of Debenhams who are able to kid themselves, but trade associations, industry organisations, MPs, media, councils, landlords, trade unions. They, along with the retailers, should all be campaigning to save our high streets, highlighting the imbalance between digital and bricks and mortar, pointing up the ridiculous nature of the business rates system, stating categorically that thousands of jobs are going to perish – not to mention the knock-on effects to communities.There’s a bit of noise, but it’s scattergun, and nowhere near concerted or loud enough. The fact it’s fallen to Ashley to say something, speaks volumes.All credit to him, though. Of course he’s got a vested interest, as he has in Debenhams. But if he does not protest, who will? Hopefully, the directors of Debenhams will wake up, along with the MPs he was addressing.It would be disastrous if the time-honoured establishment reaction to the likes of Ashley, of labelling him as an upstart, as someone not to be taken seriously, was pursued. The time for retreating into the bunker, and hoping the danger will pass, has gone. The Debenhams board must act, and act now. Likewise, where the broader state of the high street is concerned, we need action and we need it now. Mike Ashley, a saviour. Who would have thought it?

When the department store chain is included the number falls to £148.8. HoF knocked nearly £32m off the top.\u0026nbspThe, um, ‘Harrods of the High Street’, as Ashley has sought to brand his new toy, is proving every bit as pricey as the famous Knightsbridge department store to its new owner.Other Ashley bets, notably Debenhams, caused more pain in the form write downs totalling nearly £77m. He also has substantial stakes in Findel, French Connection, Game Digital, Goals Soccer Centres and the Iconix Brand Group. And he\u0026nbspbought Evans Cycles from its administrators too.\u0026nbspAll this at a time when the core Sports Direct business has held up remarkably well. Yes UK sales fell a little bit (0.2 per cent), but given the current retail climate that counts as a pretty good result.\u0026nbspIt often seems as if Ashley enjoys the practice of putting a pistol to his feet and emptying the clip into them. Yet there is a counter argument.Despite the money lavished on top business executives, they’re as inclined to groupthink as anyone else.\u0026nbspThe current consensus holds that department stores are doomed, the high street needs radical surgery, and there will be more retailers beating a path to administrators\u0027 doors\u0026nbspover the\u0026nbspcoming year. Ashley has repeatedly pushed back against that. HoF would be gone were it not for him. So would Evans, and others.\u0026nbspHe’s not above loudly calling\u0026nbspfor help (see his recent sparring\u0026nbspwith MPs). But he probably knows he’s not going to get it.\u0026nbspYet he’s still ploughing on at a time when no one else seems to want\u0026nbspto.\u0026nbspIt’s incredibly difficult to see him pulling it off.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

As a result, rents are expected to rise “modestly” over the next year, RICS said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mike Ashley’s discount retailer increased revenue by 4.5 per cent, to £1.79bn from £1.72bn, in the first half of the financial year, while underlying profits fell by 27 per cent. The company said its earnings before income, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) rose 15.5 per cent to £180.3m excluding the effects of the House of Fraser purchase.

Mr Ashley has previously said he hopes to save the majority of House of Fraser stores, and has blamed ‘greedy landlords’\u0026nbspfor blocking his attempts to negotiate lower rents in order to keep branches open. Sports Direct cutting off nose to spite face with retail invesmentsMike Ashley tells MPs: ‘The internet is killing the high street’House of Fraser customers’ anger as gift cards no longer validHouse of Fraser flagship store on Oxford Street saved from closureOn Thursday, he said: “I have made my views clear that I believe the previous House of Fraser senior management team traded the business whilst it was insolvent for a long time.\u0026nbspThis means we have significant challenges ahead in turning House of Fraser around. “However, I genuinely believe we have acquired a fantastic opportunity and with the efforts of Sports Direct and House of Fraser teams, and the support of the brands, local councils and landlords, we can turn House of Fraser into the Harrods of the High Street.”Mr Ashley recently told MPs on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee that most UK high streets are beyond help, and called for a tax on online retailers. When the committee asked him whether he could keep all of the House of Fraser branches open, Mr Ashley replied: “What person could keep 59 stores open – beside God? It’s impossible, it can’t be done.”Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at Fidelity International, said: “Replica football strips and cut-price trainers have helped Sport Direct buck the downward trend on the high street, with sales up 4 per cent over the period. However, its quest to turn the House of Fraser stores it’s acquired into the “Harrods of the high street” comes at a cost.“As a result, full-year earnings growth is expected to come in lower than last year. Whether investors will be able to look past the headline figures and see Sports Direct as a true diamond in the rough remains to be seen.”Sports Direct shares dipped by 1 per cent in early trading.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

According to the letter, obtained by the , Mr Ashley offered Debenhams a £40m interest-free loan, which was rejected. In his message, the Sports Direct owner said: “November was the worst November for retailers in living memory.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCan Mike Ashley turn around the high street when no one else is tryingMike Ashley tells MPs: ‘The internet is killing the high street’Sports Direct set for stormy AGM but Mike Ashley will win in the end“Additionally it is speculated that the company currently has a zero chance of survival.”Earlier this year, Debenhams announced plans to close up to 50 shops, putting 4,000 jobs at risk. The cuts are being made in an attempt to slash costs, after the company reported its biggest ever loss of £492m in the year to 1 September. Sports Direct currently holds 29.7 per cent of Debenhams, just shy of the 30 per cent threshold at which an offer for the remainder of the company must be made, according to the UK takeover code. Mr Ashley said in his letter that he was concerned that the Debenhams board “doesn’t really seem to appreciate” the position that the company is in “and their responsibility to shareholders”. He added: “Sports Direct is Debenhams’ largest shareholder. What we are offering is a very public statement of support at a critical time for the Debenhams business.”The letter concluded with a request that Mr Bucher reconsider the offer of a loan, and respond by “lunch time Friday”. A spokesperson for Debenhams said: “We welcome Sports Direct’s proposal as a clear demonstration of their willingness to support the company. “However, as the offer came with conditions that could affect the interests of other stakeholders, while the board does not think it could accept the proposal, as presented, it has invited Sports Direct to engage as part of our broader refinancing process.”Shares in Debenhams were down 4.89 per cent to 5.45 at close of trading on Thursday, while Sports Direct’s stock tumbled by 14.8 per cent to 235.40. Earlier in the day, Sports Direct issued a trading update for the first half and revealed that House of Fraser had lost £31.5m in the first 11 weeks after the discount retailer bought it out of administration.Sports Direct also recently purchased Evans Cycles from its administrators.

It’s named after the Gemini constellationThe\u0026nbspGeminids’ name is no accident: once it enters Earth’s atmosphere, the meteor shower seems to be coming from the Gemini constellation.In order to spot the\u0026nbspGeminid\u0026nbspmeteor shower, you should thus be looking towards the Gemini constellation, which is well positioned from\u0026nbsp10pm, the American Meteor Society explained.This gives the\u0026nbspGeminids\u0026nbspa rare status as a major shower experiencing significant activity before midnight.4. It’s also linked to a Greek godSo what exactly causes the\u0026nbspGeminid meteor shower?

Mike Ashley’s discount retailer increased revenue by 4.5 per cent, to £1.79bn from £1.72bn, in the first half of the financial year, while underlying profits fell by 27 per cent. The company said its earnings before income, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) rose 15.5 per cent to £180.3m excluding the effects of the House of Fraser purchase.

Mr Ashley has previously said he hopes to save the majority of House of Fraser stores, and has blamed ‘greedy landlords’\u0026nbspfor blocking his attempts to negotiate lower rents in order to keep branches open. Sports Direct cutting off nose to spite face with retail invesmentsMike Ashley tells MPs: ‘The internet is killing the high street’House of Fraser customers’ anger as gift cards no longer validHouse of Fraser flagship store on Oxford Street saved from closureOn Thursday, he said: “I have made my views clear that I believe the previous House of Fraser senior management team traded the business whilst it was insolvent for a long time.\u0026nbspThis means we have significant challenges ahead in turning House of Fraser around. “However, I genuinely believe we have acquired a fantastic opportunity and with the efforts of Sports Direct and House of Fraser teams, and the support of the brands, local councils and landlords, we can turn House of Fraser into the Harrods of the High Street.”Mr Ashley recently told MPs on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee that most UK high streets are beyond help, and called for a tax on online retailers. When the committee asked him whether he could keep all of the House of Fraser branches open, Mr Ashley replied: “What person could keep 59 stores open – beside God? It’s impossible, it can’t be done.”Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at Fidelity International, said: “Replica football strips and cut-price trainers have helped Sport Direct buck the downward trend on the high street, with sales up 4 per cent over the period. However, its quest to turn the House of Fraser stores it’s acquired into the “Harrods of the high street” comes at a cost.“As a result, full-year earnings growth is expected to come in lower than last year. Whether investors will be able to look past the headline figures and see Sports Direct as a true diamond in the rough remains to be seen.”Sports Direct shares dipped by 1 per cent in early trading.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores.

Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant.

There would never be a Drake without a Kanye, West wrote.Origins of the beef between West and the Canadian rapper appear to have emerged a decade ago, when the two started sharing managers – setting them on the path of in-person meetings, mutual praise across blog posts and interviews, and, eventually, their drawn-out fall-out.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHere is how history remembers the Kanye West vs Drake beef so far:Kanye West reignites, then appears to squash, beef with Drake2008, as\u0026nbspComplex\u0026nbspnotes, was the year Drake secured Cortez Bryant as his manager.Who is Bryant\u0027s business partner, you ask? None other than Gee Roberson, who counted West among his clients at the time.This appears to be the moment West and Drake\u0027s paths started to cross – the inciting incident, perhaps, of the soap opera of their lives.It might be hard to believe today, but there was once a time when Drake and West heaped praise on each other publicly.That was the year West said Drake had one of the best lines of the year on his song\u0026nbspEvery Girl.Drake, meanwhile, called West the most influential musician in his life in an interview with\u0026nbspMTV.2009 was also the year West and Drake met in Hawaii, and the year they were both featured on a remix of Jamie Foxx\u0027s\u0026nbspDigital Girl.2010: Trouble in paradiseFind Your Love,\u0026nbspa Drake song co-written and co-produced by West, was released in May 2010. A good sign, surely?Well, not exactly – West said in 2013 that he was fine working on the track until Drake got too big.In September of that year, Drake was spotted with Amber Rose – then West\u0027s recent ex, which many believe contributed to their discord.2011 will go down in beef history as the year Drake told\u0026nbspThe Source\u0026nbspabout West:\u0026nbsp“My goal is to surpass everything he’s accomplished. I don’t want to be as good as Kanye, I want to be better.”In December of that year, Drizzy appeared to confirm he was coming for West\u0027s crown\u0026nbspby rapping on DJ Khaled\u0027s\u0026nbspI\u0027m On One: I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking  Watch me take it.2013: Drake acknowledges the elephant in the roomMe and Ye just fell into this thing where we hadn’t actually talked to each other in so long that all this stuff got built up, Drake told\u0026nbspBillboard\u0026nbspthat year.Sometimes you just have to find the opportunity to tell someone that you really like and respect them. After that, everything can move forward.Rolling Stone\u0026nbspreaders gasped when Drake was quoted as dissing\u0026nbspWest\u0027s album\u0026nbspYeezus\u0026nbspin these terms: There were some real questionable bars on thereLike that ‘Swaghili’ line? Come on, man. Even Fabolous wouldn’t say some s*** like that.Drake promptly said on Twitter he never commented on\u0026nbspYeezus\u0026nbspin the interview.West was later quoted as supporting Drake during his tours, saying magazines were trying to pit n***** against each other.\u0026nbspBig Sean\u0027s\u0026nbspBlessings, on which West and Drake both feature, came out in January 2015, inaugurating what is remembered as one of the more positive years of the West  Drake timeline.In February 2015, West teased the possibility of doing an album with Drake in the future.That same month, Drake brought West onstage during one of his shows.Created with Sketch.Albums of the year 2018 Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.2016: Are we really fighting about pools?If 2015 was the year of sunshine and rainbows in the Drake  West universe, then 2016 can be marked as the year where their feud officially delved into the absurd.In his track\u0026nbspSummer Sixteen, Drake claimed to own a larger pool than West, rapping:\u0026nbsp“Now I got a house in LA, now I got a bigger pool than Ye  And look, man, Ye’s pool is nice, mine’s just bigger’s what I’m saying.”\u0026nbspWest contributed to the argument by stating: I have three pools.2016 was also the year of West\u0027s third appearance at Drake\u0027s OVO Fest, and marked renewed speculation about a possible joint album by the two artists.2018: Things get somewhat complicatedNothing much happened on the West  Drake front in 2017 – but 2018 came back with a vengeance.In May, Drake released his song\u0026nbspDuppy\u0026nbspFreestyle. In it, he responds to Pusha T, with whom Drake is involved in a separate feud.\u0026nbspPusha T had accused Drake of resorting to ghostwriters. In turn, Drake implied in the lyrics of\u0026nbspDuppy Freestyle\u0026nbsphe had ghostwritten for West, the founder of Pusha\u0026nbspT\u0027s label GOOD Music.Things escalated until September, when Drake appeared to diss\u0026nbspWest\u0027s Yeezy 350 sneakers in a collaboration with French Montana, writing: Keeping it G, I told her don’t wear no 350s around me.Instead of fighting back, West addressed Drake in a series of tweets apologising for various things, writing at one point: There should have been no songs with my involvement that had any negative energy towards you.All of this brings us to December 2018 and West\u0027s most recent tweetstorm, which appeared to have been triggered by a clearance request from Drake regarding his own song\u0026nbspSay What\u0027s Real, which features a sample by West.West tweeted a screenshot of a request before firing off many tweets about Drake, at one point claiming Drake had threatened him during a phone call.His wife Kim Kardashian chimed in, writing:\u0026nbsp@drake Never threaten my husband or our family. He paved the way for their to be a Drake.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

According to the letter, obtained by the , Mr Ashley offered Debenhams a £40m interest-free loan, which was rejected. In his message, the Sports Direct owner said: “November was the worst November for retailers in living memory.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCan Mike Ashley turn around the high street when no one else is tryingMike Ashley tells MPs: ‘The internet is killing the high street’Sports Direct set for stormy AGM but Mike Ashley will win in the end“Additionally it is speculated that the company currently has a zero chance of survival.”Earlier this year, Debenhams announced plans to close up to 50 shops, putting 4,000 jobs at risk. The cuts are being made in an attempt to slash costs, after the company reported its biggest ever loss of £492m in the year to 1 September. Sports Direct currently holds 29.7 per cent of Debenhams, just shy of the 30 per cent threshold at which an offer for the remainder of the company must be made, according to the UK takeover code. Mr Ashley said in his letter that he was concerned that the Debenhams board “doesn’t really seem to appreciate” the position that the company is in “and their responsibility to shareholders”. He added: “Sports Direct is Debenhams’ largest shareholder. What we are offering is a very public statement of support at a critical time for the Debenhams business.”The letter concluded with a request that Mr Bucher reconsider the offer of a loan, and respond by “lunch time Friday”. A spokesperson for Debenhams said: “We welcome Sports Direct’s proposal as a clear demonstration of their willingness to support the company. “However, as the offer came with conditions that could affect the interests of other stakeholders, while the board does not think it could accept the proposal, as presented, it has invited Sports Direct to engage as part of our broader refinancing process.”Shares in Debenhams were down 4.89 per cent to 5.45 at close of trading on Thursday, while Sports Direct’s stock tumbled by 14.8 per cent to 235.40. Earlier in the day, Sports Direct issued a trading update for the first half and revealed that House of Fraser had lost £31.5m in the first 11 weeks after the discount retailer bought it out of administration.Sports Direct also recently purchased Evans Cycles from its administrators.

They had hoped to land somewhere plain, but found it even more free of rocks and safe than they had been expecting.The near-absence of rocks, hills and holes means it\u0027ll be extremely safe for our instruments, said InSight\u0027s Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt of NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. This might seem like a pretty plain piece of ground if it weren\u0027t on Mars, but we\u0027re glad to see that.The spacecraft appears to be sitting in some sort of hollow, a dip made in the Elysium region where it landed when a meteor landed there. That should make it easier for the probe to dig down into the surface.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

We believe a key element of local engagement has been ongoing work with the communities in which we drive, including Arizona law enforcement and first responders.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

People were against no deal by 44 per cent to 37 per cent, for a new referendum by 46 per cent to 30 per cent and for Norway by 41 per cent to 39 per cent.A sign of just how difficult it will be to secure any deal that enjoys broad support came from another question, which asked respondents to say what it is that is most important for a Brexit deal to secure.The equal top answers were “controlling immigration” and “maintaining smooth trading links with the EU” – two things which, to an extent, are mutually exclusive because of the red lines set out by the EU and UK in negotiations.Ensuring that there is no border erected between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – the matter at the heart of opposition to Ms May’s plan – was rated as the key issue by just six per cent of people.EU ‘will renegotiate with Theresa May’ Brexit deal is voted down’Ms May is likely to play for time if the vote does go against her next week, and travel to Brussels for a summit of the European Council where she may ask for further concessions to try and make her deal more palatable to MPs.Despite a string of European figures saying there could be no further talks, ex-commission president Mr Prodi appeared to throw Ms May a lifeline on Saturday. Asked how he expected the commission to respond after the vote, he said: “Negotiate. We must keep free trade between us because it is in the British interests and European interest.”On Saturday, Ms Rudd hit out at Brexiteers who she said “flounce out quite a lot” instead of trying to get things done, an attack coming after Boris Johnson\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDavid Davis\u0026nbspquit the cabinet over Ms May’s deal.\u0026nbspAll have leadership ambitions and have been jockeying for position ahead of a potential future contest in the coming weeks.In an interview, Ms Rudd also took the unusual step of revealing details of a private conversation with the prime minister, even critiquing her leadership style by saying “she is not always forthcoming” about what she wants.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspMs Rudd is seen as a leading candidate from the moderate wing of the party and even said in her interview that she hoped it chooses a “centrist” figure for its next leader, though she said a contest at this point would be “too indulgent”.Source Note: BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,508 GB adults online between 4 and 7\u0026nbspDecember.

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If parliament can’t then it should decide to go back to the people.“Now should be the time of preparation – parliament to make sure it can canvas the options in sensible manner, one by one, to reach agreement on an option or a referendum Europe to ensure that if Britain is ready to think again, Europe is ready also to think again.“All that is necessary is for leadership: in parliament if not in government, and in Europe where despite all the myriad of challenges European leaders have, they should understand that changing Brexit would be the greatest boost to Europe’s economy and politics and that therefore, they need to focus on the part they can play and play it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The bloc has ruled this out, said it would effectively render\u0026nbspthe backstop ineffective,\u0026nbspand that it will not reopen the withdrawal agreement.That backstop policy ties the UK to the EU’s customs area and ramps up checks on goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland in order to prevent a hard border with the Republic of Ireland.“As I have always said, the guaranteed way of avoiding the backstop is to have the future partnership in place by the time the implementation period is over. The EU is very firmly committed to this course,” Ms May said.British tourists will pay €7 to visit Europe post-Brexit, EU revealsEU holds back plan to rescue Theresa May’s Brexit deal until new yearCrunch vote on May’s deal Brexit definitely not before ChristmasLeo Varadkar warns Theresa May not to renege on backstop vow“There is work still to do and we will be holding talks in coming days about how to obtain the further assurances that the UK\u0026nbspparliament needs in order to be able to approve the deal.”Mr Tusk and his European Commission counterpart Jean-Claude Juncker sought to downplay accusations that the prime minister\u0026nbsphad been treated poorly by the EU.“We have treated Prime Minister May with the greatest respect, all of us, and we really appreciate the effort by the prime minister to ratify our common agreement,” Mr Tusk said.\u0026nbsp“My impression is that in fact we have treated Prime Minister May\u0026nbspwith a much greater empathy and respect than some British MPs, for sure.”Juncker had an icy conversation on Friday morningMr Juncker\u0026nbspdismissed silent footage of an argument between him and Ms May on Friday morning. The prime minister appeared to confront him after taking offence over\u0026nbsphis\u0026nbspuse of the term “nebulous” to describe\u0026nbspthe debate in the UK. But he said the two leaders had worked it out, and that “in the course of the morning after having checked what I said yesterday night she was kissing me”.Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who is chairing the European Council, added: “Not all rumours in the media really go in line with how the meeting was. The problem is just that we had two different positions.”Accounts of last night’s meeting suggest the prime minister’s speech, in which she called for help to get the agreement “over the line”, was repeatedly interrupted by Angela Merkel asking her what she actually wanted from the EU leaders.Senior UK government officials admitted that the prime minister did not bring any documented proposals with her to the meeting.\u0026nbspThe approach puzzled EU diplomats, who for days before the conference had said they needed to see what proposals Ms May had come up with before they could respond to her request for aid.Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, said at a midnight press conference after the discussion: “I do find it uncomfortable that there’s an impression perhaps in the UK that it is for the EU to propose solutions.\u0026nbsp“It is for the UK leaving the EU and I would have thought that it was rather more for the British government.”In the margins of the summit the meeting is already being called “Salzburg 2.0” – a reference to a previous summit in September where the prime minister’s dinner speech also ended up accidentally hardening the EU position.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

The prime minister has promised to get legally binding changes.“The reaction by the EU is unsurprising. They are doing what they always do. The key question is whether the prime minister will stand up to them or whether she will roll over as has happened previously.”Jeremy Corbyn said the prime minister had “utterly failed in her attempts to deliver any meaningful changes to her botched deal”, calling for a Commons vote to kill it off without delay“Rather than ploughing ahead and dangerously running down the clock, the prime minister needs to put her deal to a vote next week so parliament can take back control,” he said.Nevertheless, Mr Boles said the route to success for Ms May was cross-party talks to “deliver their support for the deal”.Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“The best that can be said for the EU council is this: hopefully this is the last time that Theresa May tries to go it alone,” he tweeted.“Next week she must open cross-party discussions, and if Corbyn won’t play ball, talk to SNP, Plaid Cymru and backbench Labour MPs.”Pointing to only 200 supporters for Ms May in this week’s no-confidence vote among Conservative MPs, he added: “What sort of compromise could secure the additional 120 votes she needs? Norway-plus? Second referendum? Permanent customs union? Or some combination?”Ms Morgan said: “After this week’s events in Westminster and Brussels, the only way the prime minister gets any kind of deal through is with cross-party support and proper discussions to secure that now need to start.”And George Freeman, Ms May’s former policy chief, tweeted: “The PM should now pivot to a cross-party Brexit Plan B. And stand down after March 29 for the election of a new Conservative leader.”At her press conference, Ms May admitted confronting Mr Juncker over whether he described her Brexit demands as “nebulous and imprecise”, after footage emerged.“I had a robust discussion with Jean-Claude Juncker – I think that’s the sort of discussion you’re able to have when you have developed a working relationship and you work well together,” she said.“And what came out of that was his clarity that actually he’d been talking – when he used that particular phrase – he’d been talking about a general level of debate.”The prime minister insisted she was “crystal clear” about the assurances that were needed to convince Brexiteers, who are outraged by the Irish backstop plan.EU leaders released only a bare-bones statement of “reassurances”, deleting pledges from earlier drafts which had said the bloc “stands ready to examine whether any further assurance can be provided”.Ms May insisted that “as formal conclusions, these commitments have legal status and therefore should be welcomed”.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

More than 600 people have paid or put down deposits to fly aboard Virgin\u0027s suborbital missions, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber. A 90-minute flight costs $250,000.Short sightseeing trips to space aboard Blue Origin\u0027s New Shepard rocket are likely to cost around $200,000 to $300,000, at least to start, Reuters reported in July. Tickets will be offered ahead of the first commercial launch, and test flights with Blue Origin employees are expected to begin in 2019.Other firms planning a variety of passenger spacecraft include Boeing Co, Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX and late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen\u0027s Stratolaunch.In September, SpaceX said Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, founder and chief executive of online fashion retailer Zozo, would be the company\u0027s first passenger on a voyage around the moon on its forthcoming Big Falcon Rocket spaceship, tentatively scheduled for 2023.Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , said the Big Falcon Rocket could conduct its first orbital flights in two to three years as part of his grand plan to shuttle passengers to the moon and eventually fly humans and cargo to Mars.According to Virgin, SpaceShipTwo is hauled to an altitude of about 45,000 feet (13.7 kms) by the WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane and released. The spaceship then fires its rocket motor to catapult it to at least 50 miles (80.47 km) above Earth, high enough for passengers to experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet.Bezos\u0027 New Shepard has already flown to that altitude - an internationally recognized boundary between Earth\u0027s atmosphere and outer space known as the Karman line - though the Blue Origin trip did not carry humans.Virgin\u0027s Thursday launch likely will not go as high as the Karman line. Virgin\u0027s pilots are aiming to soar 50 miles into the sky - the U.S. military and NASA\u0027s definition of the edge of space and high enough to earn commercial astronaut wings by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.Thursday\u0027s test flight carried two pilots, four NASA research payloads, and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

If so, we need to massively ramp up preparation for a clean break.Why wouldn’t the EU come up with a sensible compromise Because this is a club of ideological bullies whose commitment to the project is far more important to them than the interests of their own citizens.They want us to hold a second referendum, so we make the “right” choice.But another ballot would be a disaster for trust in our democracy.The arrogance of those pushing for one here at home knows no bounds.It’s now revealed that Tony Blair, now effectively the Remain architect-in-chief, demanded that the body set up to scrutinise the work of former frontline politicians didn’t publish how he earned his cash after he left office.He doesn’t want us to find out, and he certainly doesn’t want us to have any say in the future of the country.He, and those around him, think they know best.But .million people think dferently — and Theresa May owes them every ounce of her strength.YET more evidence that the NHS is in need of desperate reform.An “over-s” AE wing  Bereaved parents being shafted It’s not money that’s the problem. Nor is it the frontline staff. It’s outdated bureaucracy, a refusal to change, and the strong-arm tactics of entrenched interests who view even the most sensible policy sht as borderline heresy.Enough. Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, has pledged to get rid of fax machines. It says something that this is considered newsworthy, but it’s a start.The Tories, contrary to what Labour would have you believe, have funnelled huge sums into the NHS.They must follow through on their promises of root and branch reform.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are due to leave the EU on March  next year, deal or no deal — and Parliament cannot agree what to do.Some MPs want the PM to go back to Brussels and negotiate something better. Others want to negotiate a dferent deal altogether. Labour wants an election. Die-hard Remainers want another referendum. Many Leavers just want to get out without a deal.And Mrs May insists her deal is the right one, despite knowing it is so unpopular that she couldn’t put it to a vote in the Commons.Whoever gets their way, it is time to strap on our seatbelts and brace ourselves for an almighty crash. However things end, we are heading for multiple constitutional crises that risk smashing our political system to pieces.Yesterday Mrs May promised more assurances from Brussels about her deal’s so-called “backstop”, in which we will be trapped in a customs union with the EU, and Northern Ireland will be trapped inside the single market.But it is completely implausible that she will be able to negotiate an end to the backstop or the right to simply withdraw from it in future.So convinced was the PM that she could not win this argument with Brussels, she did not propose it during the original talks. The Europeans insist they will not make any legally binding commitments about how the backstop might end.So the only effect of delaying the vote is to take up even more time before March . In other words, the game of chicken between ministers and rebel MPs will get more and more high-risk.The time for MPs to prevent a no-deal Brexit will be cut short, the chances of no deal will increase and ministers — because they want to bully Parliament into accepting their deal — will continue to refuse to prepare properly for no deal.And remember what the PM’s deal involves. For nearly two years — but maybe longer — we will pay into the EU budget, accept free movement and respect all European laws.Then, when there is no agreement on the future relationship, we will find ourselves in the backstop. Northern Ireland will effectively be annexed by Brussels. British goods heading for Ulster will be stopped and checked, European goods will be waved through. The EU will decide how other countries can trade with Britain, without our say and regardless of the effects on British jobs. And we will be forced to follow the rulings of the European Court of Justice.Our constitution says Parliament is sovereign: Nothing is more powerful than an Act of Parliament, debated and approved by elected representatives.What’s more, no Parliament can “bind its successors”: One generation of MPs cannot dictate what future generations can and cannot decide.Yet the PM’s deal subordinates Parliament to the EU, and does so permanently, with no legal right for Britain to escape its punishing terms. It would leave us as a colony: A country dismembered and incapable of democratic self-government.The remaining options are just as dangerous. Many pro- Europeans want Britain to join the European Economic Area and form a customs union with the EU.Norway Plus, as their plan is now known, would mean Britain accepting even more European laws than the PM proposes, without any say over what they are. For that reason, coupled with the knowledge that it does not avoid the backstop, Norway Plus is even worse than Theresa May’s deal.Yet the “Norwegians” inside the Conservative Party persist. They know there is no majority among Tory MPs for their model but they have a plan.If Mrs May’s deal is rejected and they win a majority for Norway Plus with support from Labour MPs, they can install a caretaker prime minister to deliver it.With a Commons majority for Norway Plus, they believe the Queen would be obliged to appoint their man — David Lidington, perhaps — as PM.The risk to the monarchy of embroiling the Queen in a political controversy of such magnitude seems not to matter to them. One other option, pushed by a handful of Conservatives and many Labour MPs, is to re-run the referendum. Their goal is to remain in the EU after all.The possibility they might lose, the effects on public confidence in our democracy and the instability caused by a narrow remain victory do not matter.For these Europhiles, staying in the EU is more important than the damage they might do to Parliament and to the party system our democracy relies upon.The default option, however,Parliament rejects the PM’s deal, is a no-deal Brexit. That was decided when Parliament passed the Withdrawal Act earlier this year. To override that Act, Parliament must do more than hold a single vote, and the Government must do more than negotiate something .Parliament must amend the Withdrawal Act or pass another Act to set us on a dferent path. If there is any ambiguity, the Supreme Court — whose president, Baroness Hale, has challenged the sovereignty of Parliament in the past — might again play a controversial role.While the Commons is ided, we know a majority of MPs are determined to stop a no-deal Brexit at almost any cost. Some senior Tories say they will vote against the Government in a confidence motion — risking the election of Jeremy Corbyn —it means they can stop leaving without a deal.It is probable we are heading for Norway Plus or another referendum. Whatever happens, the constitutional consequences are likely to be profound.The power of the courts, the party system, Parliamentary sovereignty, the future of the Union, even the monarchy, might come under scrutiny. Whatever happens will be controversial and further ide the country. But something has to give.So buckle your seatbelts and adopt the brace position. We are heading for a constitutional smash.Nick Timothy is former chief of staff to Theresa May.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This, alas, is the position the Government and the Prime Minister have now reached.For many people their virtues and vices are cut from the same cloth. Indeed, one may simply be an extension of another. This is what we have seen with Mrs May.Her very steadiness, dutulness and determination have led her to be unable to see that her policy has failed. In her latest House of Commons statement it was once again the mantra that “nothing has changed” — these three small dangerous words that did so much damage to her election campaign were wheeled out again but convinced nobody.After Ministers had taken to the media to insist that the vote on her deal would go ahead there was not one word of apology to them or hint of embarrassment that policy had turned on a sixpence. Continuity, instead, was claimed.At the heart of this humiliation was a dreadful deal that does not represent Brexit. As a London cab driver told me yesterday, he did not vote for a deal. He voted to leave.That widespread sentiment is not honoured in the Withdrawal Agreement, which subjects the United Kingdom to the European Union as a vassal state or colony.Yet the humiliation is even greater for having failed even to allow her deal to be voted on in Parliament. Fearing a huge defeat the Prime Minister is now scurrying around the Continent asking for something she said was impossible a few days ago.Last week this deal was the only one available and the British people were told to like it or lump it.Today, apparently new assurances can be given which will allay our fears. Both positions cannot be true and as EU officials have been arrogantly dismissive of Mrs May’s request it seems that only the airline profit margins will benefit from these trips.However, it could have been so dferent. Had the Prime Minister held the vote and lost by over  votes then she would have had proof to show the European Union that the deal could not pass through Parliament.It would have made it abundantly clear that the Withdrawal Agreement had failed and would have encouraged the EU to take her request for change seriously. Instead the President of the Commission and of the Council have mocked her and almost thrown back in her face the line that “nothing has changed”.Fortunately the UK has a trump card, which is to leave without a deal. In these circumstances we would save £billion of taxpayer’s money and be able to remove all tarfs on goods we do not produce,  helping the least well off.We can immediately cut VAT on domestic fuel, helping the elderly in the winter and remove it from women’s sanitary products where the imposition of tax is an injustice.The Prime Minister has challenged those who want to deliver on the Referendum result to be “honest” about the risks of leaving without a deal, including potential queues at Dover, as there have been in the past when the French go on strike or blockade the roads.There is inevitably a risk that the EU is determined to punish a country that leaves and is willing to break International Treaty obligations.On the other hand there are tangible advantages to be had, too, as Mrs May must herself recognise. Otherwise she ought not to have said “no deal is better than a bad deal”. If she never believed this to be the case then it explains why her negotiating position has been so weak and submissive to the EU. It is the root cause of her failure.This must now be recognised. The Government’s Policy, personally linked to the Prime Minister and the operation at Downing Street, has produced an agreement that fails to deliver Brexit and breaks Theresa May’s own promises.This has lost her the confidence of the House of Commons, for she can no longer push her most important business through, and by all constitutional precedence she ought to resign.Mrs May is a decent person with many honourable characteristics but her handling of Brexit has been hopeless, and has left the country, the Conservative Party and the Government humiliated.As we look to forge an agreement that could set our relations with our nearest neighbours for generations and define the authority of our own democracy, it is time for someone who backs Brexit to take over.Theresa May has failed because she never really wanted to do it. She is now caught in the web that she herself spun, and it is her duty to go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Those, that is, not needlessly distracted by measuring up No’s ­curtains themselves in the event that Theresa May falls.Her deal has almost no chance of winning a Parliamentary vote. Her last-minute plea for help in Europe looks doomed. Ireland’s naive, grandstanding PM Leo Varadkar absurdly suggested we simply scrap Brexit.Brussels could give Mrs May enough to satisfy the DUP and her backbenchers — but it won’t. It still hopes to engineer the ­referendum reversal which its stooges, Tony Blair and the “people’s vote” ­brigade, are shamefully plotting.But neither that dangerous, isive vote or the worst-of-all-worlds “Norway Plus” idea look likely to get a majority either. Parliament can oppose No Deal, but without an alternative it’s the default.Planning for it should have begun two years ago. In hindsight, we should have assumed it was the most likely outcome from the off. We would have extracted much better terms from Brussels.No Deal would mean a rocky few months, here and in the EU . . . Ireland especially. But Britain will weather the stormthe hatches are battened down.Look at us now. Despite all this uncertainty, and the far greater threat of Marxist Labour taking power, employment has hit a new high after a surge in full-time jobs. Unemployment is at a -year low.

I kept thinking ‘Ive won’ - things like this never happen to me.“The first thing I thought was – ‘I can be mortgage free. I could pay off the mortgage and give some money to my kids’.”But Angela’s dreams were shattered when she excitedly rushed to her local Post Office and was told the win could not be veried.Florist Angela said: “At the Post Office they put in the code over and over again, but it wasn’t working.“Everyone I had showed it to said it was a winner, but I emailed Camelot and five days later they replied and said I hadn’t scratchedoff properly.“If I had scratched off any more the card would have been wrecked.”Camelot told Angela one of her ‘winning’ grid codes was an E - not the F that she had scratched – meaning the three symbols she revealed did not match up.It comes after dad-of-four Eric was also denied a £k payout on his card - after being accused of doctoring the letter F to look like an E.Unemployed Eric, who buys six scratchcards a day, believes there was a misprint on the scratchcard after he matched three symbols.He has now invited cops to his home to have a look at the ticket and says he is the one being cheated.Similarly, Angela believes Camelot is keeping her cash because it wants to avoid a mass pay out in case there is a widespread fault with the cards.The mum-of-two said: “When I spoke to Camelot they said this had never happened before.“I told them ‘you’ve got a faulty batch and you know it and are trying not to pay out’.“It makes me feel angry because they’re denying me a legit pay-out.”The game offers five top prizes of £, by giving sixteen co-ordinates which are used to scratch off squares on a grid in the hope of matching three pharaoh symbols.Camelot insists the winning ticket has not yet been claimed and refuted claims of a faulty batch.A spokesperson said today: We do not believe this to be a faulty batch as Ms Mason claims.We will reconstruct the card in our system, just as we did in Mr Walkers case, to determine whether it is a genuine winning ticket.If we believe that somebody has intentionally attempted to defraud The National Lottery, then, just like any other company, we reserve the right to take whatever action we consider is appropriate – which includes reporting the matter to the police.”Angela has refused to give up on her claim and wants others to be aware of the alleged “faulty cards in case they miss out on their own fortune.She said: At first I took Camelot’s word for it, but now I’ve seen its happened to someone .“I don’t think it’s right. My le could have been completely changed.“I feel like I’ve been cheated.  “When I scratched the card I didn’t think it was real. But you start to believe.“For Camelot to turn around and say no, it feels like they’ve ripped that dream away.“It’s a huge conglomerate against one person. What hope in hell do you have ”Both Angela and Eric now argue they should receive the £k bounty.She said: “It’s funny that now two faulty cards have come to light within a few days of each other.It can’t just be us two. But Lotto is still saying: No, the winning card hasn’t come to light yet.“I know I’ve won.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000455331518.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"full list england worst primary schools released","story":"More than

Former EU leaders are imploring their successors to see sense.Ex-Commission President José Manuel Barroso says: “If there’s political will the excellent lawyers of the EU can find a creative solution for the backstop.“It is crucial to avoid resentment. I hope the EU council understands it. There will be no third country more important than the UK.”His predecessor Romano Prodi has also said the EU could give ground.But it will take more than vague promises. Our power to exit the Irish backstop has to be legally binding — and approved by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox.It seems vanishingly unlikely. But it’s the one thing that could yet see Mrs May’s deal rise like Lazarus from the dead.PHILIP Hammond’s “extremists” jibe at Brexit-supporting Tory backbenchers was reckless and stupid.If anything is likely to hasten a catastrophic split in the Tories it’s the Chancellor of a minority Government declaring war on scores of his own MPs. But it also displayed staggering ­contempt for politicians committed to honouring the referendum and the election manesto on which they stood.Politics has been debased by charlatans making promises they dump as soon as it’s convenient. It is in a critical stateNOT doing so is “extreme”.If there are extremists in Parliament besides the obvious, Corbyn and McDonnell, it is those playing roulette with national stability by attempting to stage a second referendum before the verdict of the first is carried out.It is incredible that it is considered mainstream, noble even, of these MPs to renege on promises they made and votes they cast — and to refuse to honour the majority’s will because the losing minority must have their “final say”.All while performing intellectual ­contortions to justy what, deep down, they know is unjustiable: imposing their will over the public’s. That is a far more extreme position than anything on the Tory backbenches.“Everyone knows who won,” says ­Benedict Cumberbatch in the trailer for Channel ’s upcoming Brexit movie.We do. Some MPs have forgotten.FOR  years The Sun has cheered on Britain’s forces at our Millies spectacular.We hope we did them proud again last night.

They need to do far more when it comes to outreach, actually visiting isolated and deprived areas and talking to children years before they start thinking about university.Otherwise, a child growing up in a community where very few people have a degree will believe university just isn’t for them.The top universities all have their own outreach policies, and don’t work together to reach particularly under-represented parts of the country, which means entire towns can often end up being ignored.The political world doesn’t help, either. A young, white, working-class boy might not think he fits into the current Parliament, and so a vicious cycle of the same sort of people from the same sort of backgrounds going into politics continues. We know all the figures about the percentage of MPs who went to private schools , or that  prime ministers were schooled at Eton.But what we are less likely to realise is that there are entire towns in this country that have never, ever had an MP who was born and schooled locally.Or that the cost of getting into politics means thatyou are from a working-class background, your only hope of becoming an MP is landing a well-paid job first. And that tends to be easieryou’ve been to university.MPs tend to recruit their researchers straight from university. Researchers go on to become special advisers or take other political jobs before becoming MPs, so the political gene pool is articially shallow from the beginning.It’s handy to have MPs who hail from all kinds of backgrounds, but especially useful to have people who grew up in tough circumstances.When governments make mistakes, it is usually the most vulnerable people who suffer first. A Parliament of old Etonians can’t always instinctively realise when a policy is going to cause trouble.I don’t need to tell you that the current Parliament isn’t working very well.From those at the top of government who have failed to take big decisions on Brexit, to the backbenchers who have been busy plotting away, a lot of people in Westminster seem to be lacking a sense of perspective.This week the drama has all been about Brexit, but the infighting means that serious policy problems on social care, domestic abuse and, yes, education are largely ignored.If we made it easier for any bright kid from any background to get to university, perhaps we would have more competition for Parliamentary seats — and end up with better politicians.SoDamian Hinds got his way with universities, he’d be putting the future mediocre politicians out of a job.There might even be entire weeks in politics when you’d have a chance of noticing comments made by the Education Secretary, rather than being distracted by the self-indulgent way in which politicians of all persuasions have ended up conducting themselves.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

lottery","story":"Two people have now come forward claiming Camelot cheated them out of winning the top prize on a £ Pharaohs Fortune ticket.Now its emerged lotto bosses recalled the scratchcards in February and only let shops start flogging them again two months later.One shopkeeper told Sun Online: In February there was an issue with the scratchcards and Camelot emailed the retailers saying to remove them straight away.When you get a potentially winning ticket, you scan it into the terminal and then manually type in the last four digits soit gets printed wrong, the machine wouldnt recognise it.At the time, the cards were scanning but not acknowledging whether or not it was a winner.It just seems to be strange and too much of a coincidence that the tickets had to be recalled and these are the ones people are complaining about.Camelot are understood to have emailed retailers after receiving complaints from users over the scratchcards.They also issued a statement at the time confirming the tickets had been pulled from shelves and asked people who believed they had one to post their scratchcards.It read: A small number of players have contacted us regarding an issue with the Pharaohs Fortune £ scratchcard, which we are looking into.We have removed this game from sale, which means that no winning scratchcards for this game can be claimed in-store.Were sorry for any inconvenience that this has caused.It comes after Sun Online spoke to a second winner, who claims she scooped the jackpot but was told it wasnt a winning ticket by Camelot.Gran Angela Mason, , believed she was cheated out of her jackpot after being told her grid code was an E - not the F she scratched.And dad-of-four Eric Walker was also denied a £k payout on his card - after being accused of doctoring the letter F to look like an E.The -year-old is fighting to prove his innocence as he claims he won the jackpot on a £ Pharoahs Fortune card three weeks ago but lottery organisers Camelot refused to pay up.He today was forced to admit he was previously jailed for handling stolen goods.The shopkeeper said: There were off the shelves for a few months in the end but the email may not have trickled down to some stores - meaning the problem batch would have been on sale still.It was pretty sharpish the way they did it. They sent the email saying remove them from shelves now and even sent someone from Camelot to enforce it.Im not sure whether people are doctoring them or not but its weird its the same scratchcard for all of them that had to be removed from sale as there was an issue with it.Camelot confirmed the scratchcard had been removed from a small percentage of shops because some players were told their tickets were not winners.A spokesperson said: Although some Scratchcards appeared to have won a prize, some players were advised that they had not won when attempting to claim their prizes in-store – this was down to an issue in our back-end system and only affected low-tier prizes of up to £.To be clear, no higher-tier prize payments were affected. We took immediate action to noty our retailers of the issue and stop further sales of this Scratchcard at the time.The system error was rectied shortly afterwards and, following a rigorous testing and approval process, the Scratchcard was put back on sale in early April  – so it has been on sale for more than eight months with no subsequent issues.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A disorderly Brexit would be good for no one.Asked about her clash with Mr Juncker, Mrs May said: I had a robust discussion with Jean-Claude Juncker - I think thats the sort of discussion youre able to have when you have a working relationship and you work well together.When he used that phrase hed been talking about the general level of debate.She also insisted European leaders ARE willing to give new guarantees on the hated Irish backstop to help her push her Brexit deal through Parliament.Mrs May said: I note there has been reporting that the EU is not willing to consider any further clarication. The EU is clear – as I am – thatwe are going to leave with a deal this is it.But my discussions with colleagues today have shown that further clarication and discussion following the Council’s conclusions is in fact possible.There is work still to do and we will be holding talks in coming days about how to obtain the further assurances that the UK Parliament needs in order to be able to approve the deal.I say again. It is in the overwhelming interest of all our people – in the EU and the UK – to get this done, and as quickly as possible.Asked by The Sun whether she would consider taking Britain out of the EU without a deal, the PM refused to confirm she was willing to take the drastic step.And she insisted she never considered quitting during the chaos of this week, saying: There is a job to be done here - I never said it was going to be easy.This morning, when Mrs May and Mr Juncker met in the EU headquarters, they had a heated conversation as other leaders looked on.Mrs May is believed to have said: What did you call me  You called me nebulous - yes you did, yes you did!Mr Juncker apparently replied: What  No, no I didnt, I didnt.The word nebulous means vague or unclear, and comes from the Latin for cloud.The PMs former aide Joey Jones quipped: Handbags. There may be a lot of theatre today.The scenes were reminiscent of Margaret Thatchers furious confrontations with European leaders when she was Prime Minister in the s.Body language expert Judi James told The Sun: There was an air of lazy bonhomie in the chamber with the usual tactile kissing, hugging and back-slapping between world leaders until May arrived at a distinctly tetchy-looking pace.Her conversation with Juncker does look from a distance like a bit of a mini-lecture or haranguing, with Juncker clutching Mays arm like a man rather surprised by a sudden complaint .Juncker normally receives displays of warmth and compliance at these gatherings but Mays cocked head and intense facial expression suggests that she might have been keen to make a rather strong point.Speaking this evening, Mr Juncker described Mrs May as a good friend, adding: This is a woman of great courage doing her job in the best way possible.But made an apparent dig at her when he described talks between EU leaders: It was crystal clear that nobody in the room did agree to reopening in any way the withdrawal agreement.Asked what the pair said to each other during their argument, he replied: We were not dancing! She thought I did criticise her by saying that British position was nebulous - I didnt know that this word existed in English.I did not refer to her but to the overall state of the debate in Britain. After having checked what I said last night, she was kissing me.Fellow Eurocrat Donald Tusk added: We have treated Theresa May with greater respect and empathy than some British MPs, thats for sure.Mrs May and Mr Juncker met for pre-summit talks earlier this week.The Prime Minister asked him for help getting changes to the current Brexit deal, or risk a No Deal scenario with Britain crashing out in March.But after all EU leaders met last night, Mr Juncker made scathing comments shooting down Mrs Mays request.He said: We dont want the UK to think there can be any form of renegotiation, that is crystal clear.We can add clarications but no real changes. There will be no legally binding obligations imposed on the withdrawal treaty.Our UK friends need to say what they want, instead of asking us to say what we want.We would like in a few weeks for our UK friends to set out their expectations because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise and I would like clarications.Speaking today, he insisted claims he himself is responsible and guilty for the Brexit are fake news.Mrs May flew to Brussels yesterday for the European Council summit after scraping through a vote of confidence from her own MPs.She is seeking changes to the backstop - designed to keep the Irish border open - to ensure Britain doesnt end up trapped in the EU customs union.THERESA MAY: What did you call me You called me nebulous - yes you did, yes you did.JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER: What  No, no I didnt, I didnt.A draft version of the summits conclusions provided a glimmer of hope for the PM, stating that the backstop does not represent a desirable outcome for the EU.It added: The Union stands ready to examine whether any further assurance can be provided.But after Mrs May made her pitch to the other  leaders, they changed the text to remove both of the helpful statements.Instead, the final version calls on EU states to step up No Deal planning.Today leaders were more accommodating in the wake of Mrs Mays press conference - Emmanuel Macron said it would be possible to clary the withdrawal agreement, while Angela Merkel said: We would need the backstop only as an insurance.Mrs May held further talks in Brussels today before flying home later.The Sun revealed last night that she is planning to hold the delayed vote on her Brexit deal on January ."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000456326949.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tony blair brexit second eu referendum","story":"The former PM appealed to European leaders to prepare the ground for Britain to stay IN the bloc.He predicted the UK would end up asking for an extension to Article  - meaning we dont leave on March  as planned.Mr Blair said Britain could then use that time to reopen talks with the EU or call a second referendum.He said in a speech: Europe should prepare for the possibility, now morphing into the near-probability, that Britain will require an extension of time to the Article  process, either to negotiate further or more likely to conduct a new referendum.We are now entering a new phase of Brexit.

A phenomenon you’ll be well aware of,you watch television or engage with Twitter.The Last Leg’s Adam Hills, for instance, is a helluvaguy. So are presenters like Nish Kumar, James O’Brien and all those other blokes who cannot stop wanging on, very publicly, about their feminist credentials and just how much they love the NHS.While others might rely simply on empty words though, Nick Knowles preferred grand heroic gestures, right from day one in the jungle when he threw himself into the water to save four women who were in absolutely no danger of drowning.The idea that Nick Knowles was every woman’s Sir Galahad, was clearly never in doubt then. At least not in his own mind.The ever-so-slightly deluded David Brent-side to his character did not fully emerge, though, until the very last week when James McVey revealed Nick’s version of Make You Feel My Love had gone to number one in the iTunes chart.A stroke of genius for production to let the news slip, obviously, and for someone to send an acoustic guitar into camp, so that Nick could delight everyone with an unplugged rendition, which Emily Atack described as “a viral moment,” much like Ebola.Dec was clearly having the time of his le poking fun at Knowles as well, describing him as: “So good at DIY he’s even gravelled his voice.”I need nearly hardly tell you what happened next then.The public got rid of Nick Knowles, just as they get rid of any jungle contestant who’s ever shown the slightest inclination to act like an entertaining jerk.This is a problem that dates right back to series one, of course, when livewires Uri Geller, Darren Day, Rhona Cameron and Nigel Benn were all voted out before silent Nell McAndrew, and it continues to prevent a genuinely great line-up from turning into a genuinely great series, eventhis one did end with exactly the right winner in Harry Redknapp.I don’t see any way round the problem, either. The voting public just seems to prefer self-absorbed young bores, on “a journey,” to genuine characters.If any of us thought Nick Knowles was finished, the moment Dec read out his name, though, we reckoned without an eviction interview which will surely take its place in I’m A Celeb . . .  folklore.For it turns out Nick Knowles wasn’t in the jungle for purely personal or financial gain.It was to heal a ided nation.“We’re having such a hard time in the UK,” he told Dec, alluding to Brexit, “I thought,we can get on, it might be a bit of a pointer to the nation.”Gee, thanks Nick. I had been wondering why a cane toad was sat on your head, during the Wicked Warehouse task, but it’s beginning to make sense now. He wasn’t finished either.“I’d like to say one last thing.” Go on . ..“Please support veterans, support the police, support the NHS, support the emergency services.They have it a lot harder, on a day to day basis, than we have it in here.”A hell-of-a-claim to make when you’ve reportedly just been paid £, to sit around a television set, in Australia, with John Barrowman, but then Nick Knowles is clearly a helluvaguy.SO there was Gemma Collins behaving like a monstrous old boot as usual, last week, when fellow BBC diner Adrian Chiles silenced her with a simple question.“Is there anything you can’t stop eating ”At which point you could see Gemma disengaging from the conversation as she ran through the checklist: “Cakes, buns, crisps, Pringles, biscuits, pies, potatoes, cows, pigs, horses, breeze blocks, deep-fried landfill, light aircraft . . . ”The silence couldn’t last forever, obviously, but it was a nice  seconds on BBC’s I’ll Get This, a celeb dinner party show, that I hadn’t really seen the point of up until the arrival of Chiles, who has a streak of honesty that’s very rare among presenters.Even by Adrian’s own standards, though, his response to the question “Why would you make the best chat show host ” was brutally self-aware.“For a huge amount of money, a big hullabaloo, billboards everywhere, I went to ITV and did another chat show, Daybreak, at which I was s**t.“I failed abysmally, humiliatingly. I looked miserable, I was sullen, I sat there like a bag of potatoes, I dragged everyone down with me, from the moment I walked in the door at am.“SoI ever get the chance to host another chat show, let’s be honest, unlikely, I will be the best chat show host ever, ’cos I know what it’s like to succeed and I know what it’s like to fail, dismally.”A confession that I expected to be met with stunned silence but it was actually greeted by spontaneous applause, from fellow celebs, and a faint whirring noise from Gemma Collins’ brain: “Doritos, kebabs, dips, mini eclairs, maxi eclairs, Jenny Eclairs . . . ”I PARTED company with Celebrity Antiques Road Trip the moment the commentator announced: “Russell Kane’s heading for an auction at Penkridge.”Anyone know how much he fetched UK’S Strongest Man. Best dead-weight lt was, of course, won by Declan Donnelly . . .  who carried about  kilos for three weeks.FRANCE is burning, Paris is in lockdown and its government’s on the brink.So how many mentions do you think TV’s fearlessly impartial satirical news shows, Have I Got News For You, The Mash Report and The Last Leg, gave it, on Friday Correct. None. Because these inconvenient facts don’t fit the narrative and agenda of the BBC and Channel , which believe Britain is a basket case and Europe is our only salvation.So it was simply ignored and all three proceeded with the same lazy and witless anti-Brexit and Trump routines they go with every week.There were some slight iations with the other material, obviously.The Last Leg and HIGNFY, ably hosted by Danny Dyer, both invited lists to be outraged by alleged sexism at the Ballon D’Or awards, held in Paris, ironically.While the final Mash Report of the series offered Rachel Parris lecturing viewers about poverty, as only a privately-educated, Oxbridge graduate truly can, before smug-bucket in chief Nish Kumar closed the show by saying: “We’ll be back next year,the will of the people demands it.”Which is almost the very last thing the will of the people will ever demand.The Mash Report will be back, though. The political agenda of the BBC demands it.Who said the following last week: “Oh my God, there’s a cockroach having dinner on my butthole.”A John Barrowman doing the Rotten Retrieval trial on I’m a Celebrity B Tyson Fury during his Good Morning Britain interview with Piers Morgan Sent in by Connor David.

Jim Davidson presented a pregnant homeless woman with straw and told her “when Mary had no inn to kip in she found a stable, so get off’ve our streets”. Which drew much applause. When Kirstie Allsopp gave an iPad to a pair of Barnardo’s orphans then took it back and smashed it “for their own good” the cheers were even louder. And when Katie Hopkins handed five Somalian refugees a tin of cockroach repellent, it brought the house down. Which was when John Bercow called for order and introduced the carol singers. First up was the ERG all-male choir, conducted by Jacob Rees-Mogg: “We’re very restless gentlemen Who shall get rid of May For Boris is our save-e-or And Brussels we must slay.” With half the room whooping Bercow balanced things by calling Nicky Morgan’s punk tribute band The Remoanes, who sang: “The Curs’d No Deal, Anna Soubry did say Would cause chaos for business and decimate pay No deal, No deal, No deal, No deal Born is the choice of the blind imbecile.” The hard right wing were spitting gammon vol-au-vents at that, until their VIP guest, Nigel Farage, led them in a lusty rendition of: “We’re dreaming of a white Christmas Just like the ones we used to know Where all our people, don’t look like treacle Just a lovely British shade of snow.” "},{"url":null,"title":"angela merkel hints shed work","story":"NewsAngela Merkel hints shed work AGAINST UK staying in EU in second Brexit referendumThe German Chancellor stunned journalists when she made the comments about Brexit during the two-day EU summit in Brussels also attended by Theresa MayShareCommentsByPhilip Blenkinsop:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsMerkel made the remark in front of journalists \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAngela Merkel caused an awkward moment when she suggested she would work AGAINST Britain remaining in the EU after a possible second Brexitreferendum. The German Chancellor briefly stunned reporters in Brussels when asked by a British journalist how she would react to the country staying in the European Union. To some surprise in the room, she said Germany would work to prevent that happening. We would of course take note of that, she told journalists. You know we are preparing for such an eventuality, but in terms of what is in my power and what we can take responsibility for, we will do everything to ensure that this does not happen, she replied, before coughing.  Merkel, who was suffering from a cold throughout a two-day EU summit in Brussels, appeared to think she had been asked what she would do in the event of a disruptive no-deal Brexit. Her spokesman promptly told her that she had misheard the question, and she rephrased her answer. Ah, right, she said. That is a totally speculative question, and I never answer those. It comes as Theresa May admitted she had a robust discussion with European Council President Jean-Claude Juncker at the disastrous Brexit summit. Mrs May was caught on camera furiously remonstrating with the euro chief. According to the Mirrors lip-reading experts, she was complaining about Juncker referring to her and her negotiating position as nebulous. And at a press conference this afternoon, she admitted she had a robust discussion with Jean-Claude Juncker.  She added: I think thats the sort of discussion youre able to have when you have developed a working relationship and you work well together. And what came out of that was his clarity that actually hed been talking - when he used that particular phrase [nebulous] - hed been talking about a general level of debate. Mrs May said: The EU is clear, as I am, thatwe are going to leave with a deal, this is it. But my discussions with colleagues today have shown that further clarication and discussion following the councils conclusions is in fact possible. There is work still to do and we will be holding talks in coming days about how to obtain the further assurances that the UK Parliament needs in order to be able to approve the deal.  Following reports that European Commission president Mr Juncker had described her presentation to EU leaders on Thursday as nebulous, Mrs May said: I was crystal clear about the assurances that were needed on the backstop, having heard the views of MPs in the House of Commons. Mrs May said it was in the interests of the EU and UK to get this over the line, warning: A disorderly Brexit would be good for no-one. She said that the EU conclusions made clear that the EU is determined to work speedily on a future relationship - or alternative arrangements - to ensure by the end of  that there will be no hard border in Ireland, so that the backstop need not be triggered. The conclusions confirm that any backstop would be temporary and that,it was ever needed, the EU would negotiate expeditiously an agreement to put a replacement in place.  She said: As formal conclusions, these commitments have legal status and therefore should be welcomed. But she said she had discussed with EU leaders, including Mr Juncker and Council President Donald Tusk, the fact that MPs would require further assurances. She said: It is in the overwhelming interest of all our people in the EU and the UK to get this done and as quickly as possible.  Mrs May managed a smile when a reporter she looked like she had had a trying week, jokingly replying: Has something happened this week  When asked whether the problems with her party at home and dealing with the EU had made her want to quit as leader, she said it was our duty as a Government and as a Parliament to see Brexit through. She added: I never said it was going to be easy. Negotiations like this are always tough. There are always dficult times and as you get closer to the very end that can get even more dficult because you are sorting out the last details of something.

The Prime Minister claimed she had been promised “further clarication” of problematic Irish border backstop in private talks with leaders on the fringes of the summit. “I never said it was going to be easy,” she said. “Negotiations like this are always tough. There are always dficult times and as you get closer to the very end that can get even more dficult because you are sorting out the last details of something.” But EU critics roundly rejected her proposal for a -month limit for the Irish backstop and blocked plans for an emergency Brexit summit in January.  Irish PM Leo Varadkar said the bloc was happy to offer “clarications” but that renegotiating the orce deal was off the table. He told reporters that the EU had Ireland’s back: “One for all and all for one”. However, Mrs May clung to suggestions that more talks could still take place between officials to get the “further assurances” MPs needed to back her deal. “There is work to be done. It is clear we can look at this issue of further clarication. We will be working expeditiously over the coming days to seek those further assurances I believe MPs will need,” she said. European leaders hinted as the summit closed that future trade talks could start soon. But they had already decided at a private dinner last night not to help the PM sell her Brexit deal to Parliament.  Instead, they turned their fire on the House of Commons, where MPs are blocking her deal. “To use a Christmas theme, we want all parties and factions in the British parliament to feel the bleak midwinter,” one source said. European Council President Donald Tusk said: “My impression is that in fact we have treated Mrs May with much greater empathy and respect than some British MPs.” Luxembourg’s PM Xavier Bettel said “the problem is MPs in London” while Danish PM Lars Rasmussen added MPs needed to “get some homework done”. The EU and the UK are now set to ramp up no deal planning as the prospect of crashing out the EU without a deal on March  rises.  Mrs May’s failure to wrangle any substantial changes to the Brexit orce deal immediately came in for criticism at home. DUP leader Arlene Foster said: The reaction by the EU is unsurprising. They are doing what they always do. The key question is whether the PM will stand up to them or whether she will roll over as has happened previously ” And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “Rather than ploughing ahead and dangerously running down the clock, the PM needs to put her deal to a vote next week so Parliament can take back control.”  Mrs May’s new woes come at the end of a tumultuous week in which she called off a Commons vote on her deal to avoid a humiliating defeat and won a Tory confidence vote but had to promise to step down before the next election. The furious PM challenged EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker after he accused the UK of being “nebulous and imprecise” on Brexit. Mrs May admitted she had a “robust” conversation with Mr Juncker. But the eurocrat, who bizarrely claimed the PM was “kissing me”, explained: “I can’t see where the British parliament is heading. That’s why I was saying that it was nebulous - foggy in English - I was not addressing her.” Mrs May willhome to a mutinous Tory party, a cabinet pushing her to put all other options - including a second referendum - to a vote and an anxious country, as the clock ticks down towards Brexit.

The Prime Minister has not even got a scrap of paper to wave at MPs when she addresses them on Monday and as a result the Brexit process remains as deadlocked as ever. Having a rebellious party and a ided Cabinet has not helped, nor has having to deal with insolent Jean-Claude Juncker, clearly unsuited to be EU Commission President. But the Prime Minister is primarily responsible for this sorry state of affairs. It was she who triggered Article  without any clear negotiating objectives, she who set down red lines which she later had to erase.  And it was she who over-promised to her backbenchers by making a commitment on the Irish backstop she knew she was incapable of honouring. Unable to chart a way forward and too weak to impose her authority, her answer is to play for time and kick the can down the road again. If she cannot find a path through then the only solution is to hand the task to Parliament.

And Andiran Nellist, , says staff at the DoubleTree by Hilton hotel probably thought he had picked his girlfriend up off the street. When Mr Nellist tried to pay for a room at the hotel in Hull city centre as a treat for himself and Martine Moore he says he was challenged on how he could pay for it.He was then told he could not stay, he told the Hull Daily Mail.Adrian was celebrating a rare night out with his -year-old girlfriend but due to the chilly temperatures, decided he did not want to stick around to wait for a taxi.   Instead, he decided to stop in town for the night and ventured inside the poundm complex, which is run and managed by a separate hospitality management company, at am to book a room. He was then told no rooms were available by a member of staff - although Adrain says there were ten available rooms listed on the internet when searching for a place to stay. Adrian, a recovery driver, believes it was because he was not dressed smart enough - despite wearing a shirt and shoes. The hotel says it is aware of the situation but that safety of guests were the main priority. Adrian said: It destroyed my birthday night out, it really did. Its disgraceful. I could not believe I was pre-judged like this. I was challenged on how I could pay for the room and I said on my card and showed him receipts. Martine was getting dirty looks from the staff - she looked great and they probably thought I had picked her up off the street or something. Martine said: It felt absolutely disgusting and getting the mucky looks - it kind of made me feel like I wasnt good enough or posh enough, to stay there. Adrian ended up spending the night at the nearby Ibis hotel but ed to the DoubleTree in the morning to find out why he was not allowed a room. He claims staff appeared more bothered about how they were going to pay and said they seemed worried about cash walk-ins. But Adrian, who felt upset over the incident, believes it was because he was not good enough, or posh enough, to sleep at the hotel. Adrian, explained: Basically, it was my first time off in a while and it was birthday and we never go out so we decided to have a night out in town. We went to Propaganda and it was freezing so at about am we decided we wouldnt wait for a taxi and wed pop into Hilton to get a room as a treat because it was my birthday. When I got to the desk the night staff told me that they didnt have any rooms available without even looking at the computer or phone. But when I checked on my phone there were  rooms available. Martine added: It just felt asAdrian had just picked me up off the street on a night out. They didnt even check the system for rooms and just seemed too bothered about how we could pay. Hilton says the DoubleTree branch, which opened in December , is managed by a separate hospitality management company called Leaf Hospitality. A spokesman for Leaf Hospitality said: We are aware of the situation and were unfortunately unable to accommodate this request. The safety and security of our guests is our primary concern.

Weeks before Christmas Chris Wallace is relying on foodbanks and soup kitchens having been forced to sleep rough when the hostel he was in asked for two weeks rent up front. He he could not afford to pay the pound bill because he believed he would not receive another benefit payment until February , reports the Hull Daily Mail. The dad had received a letter from the Department for Work and Pensionstelling him he would be switching to Universal Credit and he claims he was told he would not be paid for  weeks. He said: “I was in a hostel but they threw me out because after one week they were asking for me two weeks’ rent and I was waiting for Universal Credit to kick in.   Have you been impacted by Universal Credit  Email webnews@mirror “They said I wouldn’t get paid for another  weeks and I was evicted. I was left sleeping in a doorway and I was thinking, ‘what is happening ’ “It’s degrading and I didn’t want to be there but I had no other choice. I had one person who actually put me up in a hotel for the night and I never even got his name but I was so grateful. “I found myself walking round the city centre asking people for spare change and it is degrading. I am supposed to be trying to help the homeless and be there for them but I was actually a homeless person.” Mr Wallace, who used to be an alcoholic, has since been able to secure a two-bedroom house with ReNew - a free and confidential drug and alcohol service for adults. However, he has gone into his overdraft and has just pound. to his name. He knows he will not be able to buy Christmas presents for his two children and he will have to rely on the generosity of others to get through what is going to be a dficult couple of months. “I’ve still got another eight-and-a-half, nine weeks to go so at the moment I’m living off foodbanks and soup kitchens. I’ve got two children who I can’t afford to buy Christmas presents for because I won’t get paid before Christmas. “It’s heart wrenching. They live in London with my ex-we and come to see me every other weekend and all I wanted was to look over my dining table at them and see them enjoy a Christmas meal and open their presents. “But I know I won’t be able to see my children because they will be staying in London.   “I really am relying on foodbanks, soup kitchens as well as my friends and family. I would much rather have my own company up and running to help others and take a wage for myself.” Mr Wallace, who has been in receipt of Employment and Support Allowance , was on Universal Credit in London a few years ago when the wait for payment was just four weeks with advances allegedly given to him to help in the period before he received his benefit. However, he was led to believe he would have to wait  weeks for his next payment, creating fears that he would have to cope without a phone during a time he needs it the most. “The prospect of the next few weeks is frightening and I don’t know how I’m going to survive one day to the next. I’ve got to find a way to eat and pay my phone bills.   “My phone is my leline and I have to pay my phone bill on December  of pound. If I don’t pay that I am going to get cut off and it will leave me isolated in my own home.” Based on his own experiences of sleeping rough and suffering from a harmful addiction, Mr Wallace is in the process of setting up a homeless hub. He has applied for aNational Lottery grant of pound, so he can create a safe haven for rough sleepers in Hull, including those troubled by Spice.   The former support worker for Riverside said: “I want to find somewhere close to the city centre to create a base and it would have all the services people need under one roof. “At the moment, they are sent to dferent parts of the city for dferent things, like the GP, the mental health team and rehabilitation and they dont go because its too far out. On the issue of the new benefit, a spokesman for the DWP said in November: “Universal Credit simplies an out-of-date, complex system with evidence showing that under UC claimants are getting into work faster and staying in work longer. “Our research shows that many people join Universal Credit with pre-existing arrears, but the proportion of people with arrears falls by a third after four months in UC.

your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn influential Instagram star who admitted importing and selling fashion accessories made of endangered python skin has been warned she could face up to seven years in jail. Rich kid Stephanie Scolaro ordered snake-skin baseball caps and travel bags worth over pound, from Indonesia. The multimillionaire heiriess then sold the illegal goods on a website called SS Python or to other fashion outlets. Today a judge said he took a very dim view of the wildle crimes and compared it to trading in ivory from elephants and rhinos. The socialite leads a le of luxury and glamour as one of the rich kids of Instagram, shares pictures of high-end designer clothes and supercars with her , followers. Her sister Lana starred in the Channel  reality TV show Rich Kids Of Instagram after parading their jet-set lestyles on social media.  Their father Francesco Scolaro made millions from mining and investing in the leisure industry. This morning, Scolaro pleaded guilty to two counts of importing goods with the intent to evade a prohibition, two counts of keeping for sale a species acquired unlawfully and two counts of selling a species unlawfully imported. Prosecutor Gregor McKinley showed the court a selection of gold, cream and maroon snake-skin baseball caps. He told at Southwark Crown Court: Theres an international convention which prohibits the export, import and sale of these items and leads to UK offences. Miss Scolaro has a very active engagement with social media and in particular with an Instagram channel which she operates and manages. Shes been described in some quarters as influential in terms of fashion, in particular with young people. These articles are shown on her Instagram channel and were also offered for sale on a website she owned and operation called SS Python and though inidual sale trader outlets with which she formed an arrangement to sell the goods. There were  illegal snake-skin goods which included baseball caps, large hold-all bags and smaller bags. But she caught when German customs intercepted  caps and a large and small bag as they were air freighted from Indonesia to the UK. Mr McKinley said: These caps, one large and one small bag, were intercepted by the German customs police at Leipzig airport on November .  The German authorities informed the British authorities of the consignment and allowed it to continue into the UK. The consignment was directly addressed to Miss Scolaro at an address associated with her parents address in Curzon street. It was with the forwarding company DHL at the same time as the police were making enquiries. Scolaro tried to find out where her goods were but was told by DHL to contact the sender. Police then began an investigation in the Instagram stars affairs and found she was selling the snake-skin accessories on her website, Instagram account and with small traders in London. Mr McKinley said: One count refers to a small fashion outlet in Bexleyheath. One of those caps was on sale there and the owner of that shop said he paid Miss Scolaro pound for it but her suggested retail price was pound. As part of the police investigation, caps addressed to her were confiscated at Heathrow Airport while five were found in another shop on sale for hundreds of pounds. The prosecutor said: Three were on sale for pound and two were on sale for pound. Mr McKinley said Scolaro refused to cooperate in locating the goods and gave a no comment interview. He said: All of the investigation has been by the police from the website and the Instagram account and without any cooperation from the defendant for finding this items and where they have been on sale.  There are some  of these baseball caps. If we take the retail value as was suggested by the defendant herself, it amounts to about pound, the value of these hats comes to pound,. The large bags which were intercepted were advertised on the website for pound,. We dont have an estimated value for the small bags but the large bags and hats comes to pound,. When the goods came for Indonesia they had documents purporting to be export permits with them. But Mr McKinley said: Both of these documents have been checked and both are forgeries. The maximum penalties on the regulatory offences is five years on each of these offences. And the customs and excise management offence is a maximum of seven years. Judge Michael Gledhill said: I still take a very dim view of this. Were talking about the same category of offending that members of the public will be more readily aware of. Its includes ivory from elephants and Rhinos. Scolaro will be sentenced at the same court next month.

Researchers who polled , children aged  to  found many have NO ONE they look up to. And rather than turning to their teachers and parents for advice on their career, school work or fitting in, nearly half of kids turn to YouTube instead for guidance. Similarly,  per cent revealed their first point of call for careers advice has been to try to contact a celebrity directly in a bid for help. The research was commissioned by the Institution of Engineering and Technologywhich warned a lack of relatable role models for children could ensure the UK’s engineering skills shortage continues. David Lakin, head of education at the IET, said: “It’s worrying that children are turning to celebrities and influencers for credible careers advice rather than industry role models.  “The research shows there needs to be more mentor figures from STEM backgrounds and this could be why, when it comes to career inspiration, engineering falls short. “We need to continue to raise awareness of the vital role engineering plays in some of the UK’s most popular industries – from music to TV production and sport. “These results show that social media is playing a huge role in shaping the future of children’s career aspirations and choices.” The research also found, around seven in  children aren’t aware of the vital role engineering plays in some of the most popular industries - including the music, film, sports, TV and vlogging industries.  In fact, very few - less than a fth - of those polled were able to name two or more engineers, mathematicians or scientists. As part of the research, , parents were also surveyed – it emerged nearly half don’t know who their children’s role models are. And more than half admit they’re worried their kids choice to look up to reality stars and celebrities - rather than figures who are making a genuine dference to the world. Carried out through OnePoll, IET’s research was commissioned to coincide with the IET’s partnership with pop trio, New Hope Club, and Blue Peter.

Jan Cruickshank, , said her bosses believed her colleagues side of the story, but she has finally been vindicated after winning a case of unfair dismissal. The Construction Industry Training Boardhas written an apology and agreed to pay her pound,. Jan, of Aberdeen, told the Daily Record she was sexually harassed by a co-worker for more than three years before he raped her. But her bosses believed his claim that they were having an affair, and she said she was sacked for apparently misusing company time. Married mum Jan, who has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, said: “You hear the same platitudes all the time - report rape, report sexual harassment at work, women will be listened to and treated as equals. “I was sexually harassed for more than three years. I reported it, I reported him exposing himself to me and sending me a photo of his genitals and I reported being raped. “But protecting his career seemed to be paramount. It didn’t matter about mine. That could go down the toilet because I was a woman. “I was sacked apparently for misuse of company time by having an affair.”   Jan says her colleague raped her in March . Police said there wasn’t enough evidence to bring rape charges, although Jan was awarded a four-figure sum in criminal injuries compensation. She ended up on sick leave and was subsequently sacked. She took CITB to an employment tribunal for unfair dismissal and they offered a pound, settlement. Jan refused to accept it and pressed ahead with the case. She only settled last month after CITB offered pound, and dropped demands for Jan to sign a confidentiality clause. Now free to reveal her ordeal, she said her legal battle was never about money - it was about exposing how CITB had treated her. Jan said: “There was never any way I was going to agree to be gagged. I was ready to risk everything to make sure I could tell anyone I wanted how I had been treated.” She said the harassment started shortly after she started as an apprenticeships officer at CITB. She added: “I loved my job and I was good at it. I didn’t mind being one of the lads and having a laugh and joke with colleagues. “This one guy was very complimentary to me and I liked working with him. But occasionally I had to slap him down when he crossed boundaries, telling me he fancied me and wanted me. Two months after I started, he sent me a text asking meI ‘fancied a f***’. “I made it clear that I loved my husband Rob, I had never been unfaithful to him in  years and had no intention of doing so now. “Usually, he backed off when he saw I was angry but the inappropriate behaviour always resumed. “Five months after the text, we were working in his home town and he took me to his house to collect something and asked me for a ‘quickie’. I refused. “In June , we were doing a careers event at Alford, Aberdeenshire, and he exposed himself to me at the hotel. “In August , he sent me a photograph of his private parts.”   Jan told how six weeks later, the colleague called her and committed a sex act while on the phone. She added: “On each occasion, I warned him off and he would back down. I told him we could be friends and colleagues but never anything . “I sometimes talked about his behaviour at work but didn’t want to make trouble for him. I thought I was handling it. “At the end of March , we were attending a conference and staying at a Highland hotel. He came to my room with a bottle of wine before we met colleagues for dinner. “I thought it was OK to have a glass of wine with my colleague because I had told him nothing would ever happen between us. But it wasn’t OK. “He wouldn’t listen. I was overwhelmed and I froze.” Jan said that she felt filthy and violated afterwards. But because she hadn’t fought him off, or screamed and shouted, she told herself it couldn’t have been rape. She added: “It didn’t make sense. I’d seen rape on Crimewatch. It was carried out by strangers with knives. “I hated myself for not stopping him. I couldn’t bear to look at my husband, the man I adored, because I felt like I had cheated on him. I was so ashamed.” After the incident, her colleague virtually stopped talking to her at work. They became hostile to one another. Jan finally reported him for sexual harassment and, following counselling, for rape. He told his employers he and Jan had been having an affair for three years and she was hitting back at him because he had ended it. Minutes of grievance meetings show her managers accused her of lying and they believed her colleague’s claims of an affair. One female manager even told her that “perhaps it was necessary to say no more than once”. Jan ended up on sick leave and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and later dismissed.  Police interviewed her colleague about the rape allegation and the claim that he had exposed himself to Jan. She said detectives told her he had given a “no comment” interview and without corroboration, he could not be charged. The indecent image he sent Jan was reported to the fiscal but it was decided that prosecution would not be in the public interest. However, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority found she had endured a “serious sexual assault” and awarded her a four-figure sum. Jan kept the rape from her husband for almost four months. But he knew something was wrong as she was drinking heavily and crying in bed at night. In a statement he made to CITB, Rob said he had seen a text message sent in November  to Jan’s phone saying: “Fancy a f*** ” The colleague later apologised to them both and excused himself by saying he had been drunk. Rob also outlined how Jan finally told him that her colleague had forced himself on her. He said: “Jan was inconsolable and I was very angry. She was confused and distraught and she called Rape Crisis. The woman listened and told her that she had no reason to feel guilty as she had been raped.” Jan said: “When I eventually told Rob, I felt like a weight was being released from my body. “I watched his face crumble as his le imploded and my heavy, filthy secret began to crush his soul instead. “Hurting him so badly tore my heart out and I wished I could snatch the secret back but it was too big, too heavy.” The CITB’s first offer of pound, to settle her claim for unfair dismissal without incurring the costs of a tribunal hearing was made in December last year. Lawyers for Jan’s union Unite and personal injury and employment experts Thompsons described it as “on the low side”. CITB offered pound,, still with conditions and no apology and Jan was advised to consider accepting. She refused. The offer went up to pound,. But Jan continued to make it clear to Thompsons and Unite that she would risk a tribunal to make the matter public, rather than be gagged. The offer was increased in stages until CITB agreed to drop the confidentiality clause and offered a written apology and pound,. Jan said: “It sounds like a lot but I’ve lost a lot more – my reputation, my career, a regular salary, a company car and I’ve incurred debt since unexpectedly losing my job. “I was good at my job, had good appraisals and earned management qualications, yet they pushed me until I was suicidal.” Emma Black, general counsel for CITB, said: “CITB and this former employee agreed a settlement to her claim prior to court proceedings. In accordance with our practice, we will not comment further on the details. “CITB are committed to providing a safe working environment to all their employees, treating all genders equally. “Wherever lessons can be learned across the organisation, CITB look to improve their policies and processes.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mums genius idea solves christmas","story":"NewsMum sells rearranged Quality Street tubs - so everyone gets their favouriteCaroline Jefferson, from Southwick, has set up a very clever Christmas business rearranging Quality Street tubsShareCommentsByRobyn DarbyshireAudience Writer:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsCaroline came up with a very clever solution \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWe all have our favourite Quality Street - and it can cause family rows around Christmas time.

The -year-old marketing manager says she struggled to see pregnant woman as she always wanted a family and was puzzled as to why she couldnt have a baby. Nina told Essex Live: Seeing pregnant women was dficult. Every time I saw someone it was hard because I always wanted a family. Even with my friends it was hard. My friends are so supportive but sometimes I didnt want to see them and they would understand.When their babies came along, that completely vanished but I really struggled seeing pregnant women.

I talk quite openly about it and tell my friends just to treat me as normal. When I went back to work after my miscarriages, I told my colleagues not to be really nice to me. Im happy to talk about it, people dont have to pussy-foot around me. Doctors were determined to get to the bottom of Ninas heartache and finally Nina had the answer she was looking for. The mum discovered she had killer cells, which is when the body attempts to get rid of things it thinks shouldnt be there due to the high levels of antibodies. It often attacks and kills the embryo as it is seen as a foreign organism.  I had never heard of killer cells before but it tries to get rid of what it thinks shouldnt be there, Nina said. The staff at Broomfield Hospital were fantastic but for the first miscarriages you have to wait until to take a fertility test. I understand why but I just couldnt go through it again. When we actually got to the problem, the staff were excellent, they wouldnt give up at all. It was hard to speak to friends about it. Nina was put on medication and eventually became pregnant for the seventh time with her husband Lee. During my seventh pregnancy, I worried about everything, what I ate, what I drank, she said. You do get bleeding at the beginning but I was in a constant state of worry. I paid for extra scans so we werent waiting too long inbetween. You know its going to be fine but there is always that little but of doubt in the back of your head.  In a bid to try and settle her nerves, Nina visited Colchester Zoo - a place she has loved since she was a toddler - and paid a visit to Rajang. She continued: Ive been going to the zoo since I was four and five and Rajang was always my favourite. I go to the zoo probably once or twice a year now, I used to go along with my sister-in-law and I got her really involved in loving the zoo and Rajang and I saw him each time I went. When I had my first miscarriage, we went to Norfolk and we went to the zoo. Its a place where I can switch off. During my seventh pregnancy, I went with my friend and we just decided to go for a walk and get the baby moving so we decided to walk miles around the zoo. We got to Rajangs enclosure and there was a massive queue, but my friend was patient and waited with me until there was a gap. I lted up my top to show him my belly and he shuffled along the side and just gave it a big kiss. I just cried.  It was such an emotional moment, it was only a small thing but it meant a lot to me. I have seen him do it many times to people and I just always thought it was so lovely.I would have been devastatedhe hadnt done it. There were things I wanted to do while I was pregnant and that was one of them. Hes not that interested in kids, my godson tried but he wasnt interested. Rajang did do it to my husbands belly once though. To Nina and Lees delight, she gave birth to a healthy baby girl in November , named Elizabeth, who Nina calls her lucky number seven. Sadly, yesterday, Colchester Zoo sadly announced the death of -year-old Rajang, who proved to be a lucky charm when he planted a huge kiss on Ninas swollen belly. He passed away after suffering from chronic arthritis and other health problems that come with old age. In the last few months, Rajangs condition worsened and he began experiencing periods of losing focus similar to that of a degenerating neurological condition.  Despite best efforts from the veterinary team, Rajangs condition inevitably further deteriorated and the dficult decision was taken to end his suffering and put him to sleep. The orangutan was one of the most popular residents with both staff and visitors- including Nina, after first arriving in . Nina added: When I heard the news, I was a little bit tearful because I had seen him so many times over the years. I was quite emotional. He was such a massive part of the zoo, people have loved him for such a long time. I think, especially in the olden days, he was one of the first animals you saw and when his enclosure moved, everyone would make sure they saw him. It is a shame. I took my daughter to the zoo but she fell asleep so didnt get to see him. Its a shame shes not going to have those memories that I had as a child. When they are really young, they dont really understand whats going on. I will take her back and Im going to get annual passes, it is such a lovely place.  Following his death, thousands took to Colchester Zoos Facebook post, to share their fond memories of Rajang. One person wrote: So heartbreaking to hear! He was a true king of the swingers and a king among men. Shame to see him go, I always had fond memories of visiting him on school trips and learning the importance of conservation efforts to keep orangutans and their habitats alive. Rest in peace you gentle giant. Another wrote: This is literally the saddest news! Ive got a lump in my throat and tears streaming down my face. I was honored to get to meet Rajang last year and give him a big cup of tea . Its because of Rajang that I love orangutans so much. He connected with me and my middle daughter in  and we have loved him and orangutans ever since. He touched our souls when he looked back at us with those deep brown eyes and he really moved me. I always remember him being at the zoo since I was a little girl. He was always near the entrance. He may not have had any children but his legacy will always live on in those who remember and love him. RIP Rajang, you beautul boy. Visitors of the zoo shared fond memories of Rajang including him kissing pregnant bellies and playing Peek-a-boo with children.  Another person said: I have great memories of first meeting you as a child with my mum, watching people throwing bananas in  you passing them to others. I have grown up with you for  years! Youre a beautul soul. Thoughts are with your keepers. Such a horrible day! Colchester Zoo announced the sad news about Rajang on Wednesday and shared some special memories they have had of him. They said: All the animals in our care have their inidual personalities which we all fall in love with but Rajang was one of a kind with a personality so unique, fascinating, loving and interesting. Rajang always had a twinkle in his eye and despite orangutans not having the same facial muscles to express their emotions the way in which humans do, Rajang communicated with his keepers and visitors through his beautul eyes and expressions he would make with his mouth. Rajang always showed interest in people, and no doubt there will be a number of pregnant visitors who experienced Rajang ‘kissing’ their baby bumps, something he became world famous for through viral videos. Rajang would also copy his keepers’ actions, so much so that they would give him similar utensils to be able to fulfil the actions he was seeing Rajang cleaned his own windows and also done some gardening by putting a plant in a flower pot after watching the gardener! It’s moments like these that we will treasure forever. Thousands of people shared their pictures and stories they had with Rajang who has been a resident at the zoo since . One person commented: Always the highlight of my visit, I could spend ages just watching him doing nothing yet be spellbound by it. Rest well Raj, while another said: Rajang, you were beautul and gentle and you were literally my dream come true when I met you in April! RIP buddy. Rajang celebrated his th birthday on June  this year and to mark this special occasion the zoo commissioned an artist to draw a limited-edition portrait of Rajang, which are now available to purchase from their gt shop. To ensure visitors of the zoo remember Rajang, Colchester Zoo are going to site a special book at Orangutan Forest where people are encouraged to write down their fondest memories of Rajang. In the near future they will be renaming Orangutan Forest to include Rajang’s name to ensure his legacy lives on and the gardens by All Saints Church, will also be dedicated to him.

In total over one quarterof respondents reckon he should be rebranded as female or gender neutral, according to  ABC. Over on social media the results of the survey have had mixed reactions, with some claiming the idea is ridiculous, while others dont understand the point in arguing over a made up character.  But given Santa Claus is a fictional character designed simply to make Christmas fun for the kids, does it really matter whats underneath his signature red outfit  The issue of what gender Santa should be has taken on a new signicance in recent times, as people on social media and even politicians are taking a stance on the issue. Arun Chandran, a Labour Party councillor for Newton Ayclfe in County Durham, moved to ban female Santa Claus impersonators from taking part in an annual winter parade last month, after two women volunteered for the job. He said that the concept of a female Santa Claus was a form of political correctness, adding that it was a male role, according to .

Those six words signalled the end of one of the most intense manhunts in history - Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had been caught.The tyrant had spent nine months on the run and evading US forces, but now his time was up. As he crawled out of the spider hole looking disheveled and unrecognisable with a salt and pepper beard, he shouted at the soldiers who found him: dont shoot, dont shoot. “I am Saddam Hussein, he added. I am the president of Iraq, and I am willing to negotiate.”To which one of them replied: “President Bush sends regards.”  This week marks  years since the extraordinary operation - named Red Dawn - came to jubilant end. Forces had been tipped off that the despot was somewhere near his birth place of Tikrit in Iraq. This information led them to a farm. It was while searching the area that a solider lted up a blanket to reveal a small hole. Inside the six-eight foot deep concrete bunker and armed with a pistol, Saddam was hiding.  It was just big enough to for a person to lie down and a pipe had been installed to let air inside so he didnt suffocate.For decades he had ruled Iraq and inflicted brutality and bloodbaths but in April  he refused to be overthrown and vanished. “Saddam gone! Saddam gone!” was chanted throughout the country before his statue came crashing down.A US armoured recovery vehicle smashed the marble staircase leading to Saddam’s statue – a tribute on his th birthday – in the capital’s Firdoz Ali-Baba Square.  A soldier then clambered atop the machine’s giant jib and attached a chain to Saddam’s throat before smothering the face in the Stars and Stripes. He would go on to replace it with an Iraqi flag, winding it round the dictator’s throat like a cravat, before the statue was pulled down to huge cheers. Locals then began smashing at the concrete head and dragged it down the street.

thumping of then-league leaders Killie last weekend.Despite that beating, McGowan expects a massive challenge at Rugby Park from Steve Clarke’s side.McGowan said: “It’ll be a tough week being away to Kilmarnock, Aberdeen and then Celtic.“That’s as hard as it comes at the moment.“Kilmarnock have been flying until the Celtic defeat, Aberdeen is a hard place to go and I can’t remember the last time Dundee won up there and then Celtic away doesn’t get any harder.“It’ll be dficult for us but we got a result against Rangers to keep the confidence going.“If we take each game at a time then who knows ”After that, the Dark Blues bring  to a close with two home games, firstly welcoming Livingston to the Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park on Boxing Day before St Johnstone make the short trip up the A on December .Despite being mired in a relegation battle heading into these fixtures, the feeling around the ground is upbeat after Dundee’s upturn in form.After a slow start under manager Jim McIntyre, the work done behind the scenes has begun to pay idends on the pitch as they look much more solid defensively and potent in attack.That’s been helped by the scoring form of striker Kenny Miller, though McGowan says he and the rest of his team-mates need to start adding to the goal tally to get themselves out of trouble.He added: “As a unit we’ve been hard to beat but we also look dangerous in attack.“We’re going down the flanks, attacking with numbers and getting numbers in the box so you can see the work is starting to pay off for us.“We’ve started to score goals – Kenny has been banging them in and others are chipping in.“Jesse Curran got his first goal, I was delighted for him against Hamilton but we all need to chip in.“You can see the boys are buying into what we are trying to do and you can see how hard we are working on the pitch.”Dundee were impressive in defence to hold a Rangers side with a man advantage last Sunday and McGowan knows they’ll have to repeat that type of performance throughout the games this week.The midfielder, though, rejects any idea of Dundee becoming a counter-attacking side.He said: “I don’t think we are necessarily a counter-attacking team, I think when we win the ball we attack at pace and we are being relentless.“We can keep the ball as wellwe need to and we can mix our game up well.“We did that well against Hamilton, knowing when to go and when not to go.

lead.“We know playing against Morton they’ve got good delivery with Michael Tidser and have got big centre-halves that can come up so we know we shouldn’t be giving free-kicks away round about the box.“We gave away a schoolboy free-kick, Chris Millar’s out on the touchline with nowhere to go and two guys roundabout him but we steamroller into the back of him.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0fb4708a077.jpg ","title":"tom duthie lets hope christmas hasnt come early for dundee united","story":"Has Christmas come early for Dundee United fans  For once the answer to that question is they definitely hope not.For most of us getting to unwrap a package in advance of the th of this month is a happy bonus butthe festive season has arrived early for Arabs this year, they won’t be happy.That’s because last year, Christmas brought the first strong indication things under then new boss Csaba Laszlo were not going to work out.Dismissing what was a largely irrelevant Irn-Bru Cup defeat against Crusaders, technically his first game in charge, an impressive start that had produced four wins and a draw was brought to a shuddering halt with a late December defeat against leaders and eventual champions St Mirren.It was a reversal from which the Tangerines, and ultimately the gaffer, never really recovered.From having the chance to hit the top of the table as they travelled to Paisley that night, within weeks, any chance of automatic promotion was effectively gone.January this year brought a humiliating - defeat away to a Falkirk side who were struggling near the bottom of the Championship and the month ended with an almost equally painful home loss to Morton.Coming as they did in the weeks following the Buddies clash, those were defeats that pretty much confirmed United were not getting back to the Premiership at the end of the season.Now, under another new managerial appointment in Robbie Neilson, the team could be in danger of following a similar path to last term, albeit it a few weeks earlier.Five wins and a draw into his reign, the other week saw a wake-up call like the one his predecessor received when leaders Ayr United came to Tannadice and dealt out a - thrashing.That was alarming and the bells had barely stopped ringing before there was more concern as Robbie’s team squandered a lead at Morton last Saturday and had to settle for a draw. Festive flippancy aside, there is, of course, reason to believe the slide in results presided over by Csaba will not be repeated this time round.Under the new boss, the Tangerines have looked better organised and with a clearer game plan than they’ve probably had since the early days of Jackie McNamara’s time in charge, or certainly since Ray McKinnon’s first term in charge.Their style under this gaffer, by no means just blood and thunder, is more robust and therefore better suited to the physical rigours of Scotland’s second tier.On top of that, and in part it should be said because of Csaba’s ability to identy decent talent, there can be little argument this season’s squad contains better overall quality.In striker Pavol Safranko they have a front man of the calibre many teams even at top-flight level must be anxious off.And wide man Fraser Aird has been another astute signing who, like Safranko, has really come into his own under the current boss.There is also reason to believe his past, successful, experience of Championship football when he raced to promotion at Hearts means that come next month’s transfer window, Robbie will get exactly what he needs to strengthen the weaker areas of his team.The impressive form of Ayr United does remain a worry and, as they showed at Tannadice the week before last, they have to be regarded as serious promotion contenders.Ross County and this weekend’s opponents Inverness also remain challengers.And another disappointment against them could have fans worried about that early Christmas gt."},{"url":null,"title":"we are the team no one wants to play says dundees gensy kusunga","story":"Gensy Kusunga says Dundee used to be the team everybody wanted to play – now they are the team nobody wants to face he’s urged his team-mates to keep their focus.The impressive defensive display which earned the Dark Blues a - draw at home to Rangers, despite being reduced to  men after just  minutes, lted the side off the foot of the Premiership table for the first time since August.And that was in no small part down to the solid defensive display from Angolan international Kusunga, alongside centre-back partner Andy Boyle.Between them, they repelled everything Rangers threw into the box to keep up their unbeaten run, which now stretches to four matches.And the confidence which is oozing through the team now, allied to that dogged defensive display, will mean nobody will fancy facing Dundee in the coming weeks, evenit is Kilmarnock, Aberdeen and Celtic away next.Kusunga said: “I hope that is the case!“It’s good to hear that other teams won’t want to play us.“Before everyone wanted to play us to take confidence! Now it has turned around but we need to continue.“It’s good to have confidence – but not too much!“We have to still work, work, work and not feel we are there because we drew and won one game.“We have to stay focused and, hopefully, we can get some good results before the break.”The former Basel defender is delighted the club’s form has turned around but has urged the Dark Blues not to relax as they bid to continue their resurgence in the busiest time of the season.After three matches on the road in seven days, Dundee will welcome Livingston to Dens Park on Boxing Day before St Johnstone make the short trip from Perth on December .Despite moving off the bottom of the Premiership table, Kusunga knows the work has only just begun and wants the “belief” that has surged through the team to continue.He added: “We are happy because we had to work hard for the draw with  men against Rangers.“It was a good game, a massive game for us and to take points was the most important thing.“We are happy but we need to stay focused.“The road is a long one and we need keep our focus for the next game and the many games in December where we need to get points.“We showed a lot of belief on Sunday,  against  for so long and never put our heads down. We stayed strong, stayed together and everybody worked, worked, worked – when you do that you can get results, that’s the key.“It was important for the confidence to keep our run going but we can’t relax, the way is long and we have to take things game after game and do the maximum we can.”The dference in Dundee’s displays over the past few weeks and the rest of the campaign is a marked one with the side trebling their points total in the last four matches.And Kusunga says taking responsibility as a team rather than pointing to inidual errors has been a massive factor.He said: “Everybody is taking responsibility. Before we could always say we didn’t win because of one mistake, you need to take responsibility and work like men.”And he’s urged the Dark Blues to repeat their show against Rangers in the coming weeks.He added: “Every game is hard, the opponents are strong in every game and we can’t think about playing a small team or playing a big team.“Every match is dficult and we need to work hard the same against whoever we play.”"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas -

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"luke naisby named red stars new manager","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAccomplished defender Luke Naisby is Lochgilphead Red Star AFC#s new manager.The new manager#s first challenge was to take charge of Red Star against Ferguslie Star AFC on Saturday November  in Paisley.The Red Star Facebook page said: #The committee is delighted to welcome him to his new role with the club.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta.

These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

A positive inspection report from Education Scotland found consistently “good” performance across the board at Stration Primary School and Eary Years Centre. The inspectors came to their conclusions after a recent visit to the school that included discussions with parents, children and staff. The inspection team found the following strengths in the school’s work: • Headteacher Liz Candlish leads the strong staff team to achieve the best quality educational experiences in a learning environment which is nurturing and encouraging. • The motivated children who are engaged in their learning. Their exemplary behaviour is respectful and caring of adults and each other. • The strong links and involvement with members of the community. They feel valued by staff and enhance children’s outdoor experiences and enterprise activities. The following areas for improvement were identied: • The school should take steps to increase the pace and progression of children’s learning to raise attainment. • Assessment data collected from a range of sources should now be acted on more consistently to ensure maximum impact on the attainment of a few learners. • A structured approach to develop more independent learners, who can talk about their learning and be clear about their next steps. Councillor William Grant said: “I’m pleased to see such a positive report for Straiton, with staff delivering high quality learning for all children, something that should come as welcome news to families. “Headteacher, Liz Candlish, was singled out for providing strong leadership, with the school thriving and providing a nurturing environment that is inspiring children to embrace learning and to care for each other. “I would like to thank everyone involved for working hard to maintain the high standards at Straiton.” Inspectors are confident that the school has the capacity to continue to improve and so they will make no more visits in connection with this inspection.

Reporter Hilary Scott went along to find out more...PRIORSFORD Primary School welcomed a new addition to the register this week, and she goes by the name of Peggy.As I signed in at the school, I note the reason for my visit as meeting Priorsfordrsquos new pupil who will be joining Mrs Sharprsquos P class.But Peggy isnrsquot your average pupil. In fact shersquos really quite unique in that shersquos furry, has four legs, a tail, and is the schoolrsquos very own puppy.So how did this adorable pooch make its way into the lives and hearts of the pupils and staff at Priorsford  Did the pupils ask for a puppy on their Christmas list this year I discovered that Peggy was actually on the wish list of teacher Caroline Sharpe, who approached headteacher Sandra Macgregor a year ago with the idea of a therapy dog for the school.Caroline explained: ldquoWe heard about therapy dogs and the benefits they bring to pupils, we wanted to tie it into our health and wellbeing in the school.ldquoI attended the SSPCA conference and there were people there from universities who had taken therapy dogs into final exams for students.ldquoEvidence shows that therapy dogs lower peoplersquos heart rate, gives a general sense of well-being and improves childrenrsquos socialisation skills. We visited a school in Midlothian who had a Cockapoo puppy and we knew we could make it work for us. She has changed the dynamic of the school.Peggy will live with Caroline, but will be in school full-time.Having settled into her new home at Priorsford Primary this week, Peggy is already the most popular pupil in school.Despite skipping five primary year-groups to join the P class, Peggy is at the very start of her journey to becoming a certied school dog.ldquoShe has settled in well and has already met the pupils at assemblies. My daughter is a vet and told me to expose her to everything straight away. The time between eight and  weeks is really important for stamping the personality and the secureness of the puppy, added Caroline.Peggy is learning how to become a listening dog, who will help children read aloud more confidently. She will put her head in their lap and listen without judgement, prompting them to turn a page with her paw.Caroline explained: ldquoNot only will she improve the pupilrsquos literacy skills, Peggy will be there for any children who are feeling anxious or worried, they can take some time out to talk to her.I joined the P class in the library as they read the tale of Greyfriars Bobby to Peggy. But she was worn out after a busy morning and childrenrsquos soothing reading put her to sleep!As I wander through the school with Peggy, pupils eyes widen at the sight of the furry bundle and instantly a smile lights up their faces. ldquoI love her Mrs Sharp, she is soooo cute, cooed one girl.When it came to naming the puppy, it was decided not to ask the children, who, Caroline said, would have come up with wonderfully unique suggestions.Before leaving the school, I am given Peggy to cuddle, and for a split second I consider slipping her into my handbag and making a run for it. But a vision of an angry mob in blue chasing me through the playground fills me with fear and I decide she is exactly where she should be.It is said that dog is a manrsquos best friend. But at this Peebles school, dog is the best friend of over  pupils who have become the proud owners of this gorgeous puppy Peggy, who has brought joy, happiness and love to her new home at Priorsford Primary."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion","story":"This week Bosco Santimano, founder and executive director of social enterprise You Can Cook, shares his thoughts on organic farming.Most of us are already conditioned into believing the so called lsquomagicrsquo of science. That science has or will find solutions to all our manmade problems. The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes! It can."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-factory-announces-50-redundancies","story":"ONE of the regions major manufacturers has announced that it is looking to pay off more than  members of staff.Jedburgh-based Mainetti UK is looking for voluntary redundancies following a second year of reported losses.Bosses at the Oxnam Road coat-hanger manufacturer are blaming recycling and a reduction in high street retailers as well as an increase in the minimum wage for combined losses over the past  months of more than pound million.Mainettis Regional MD Jim Hutchison stated: \"The last two years have been dficult for the business.\"In  Mainetti UK Limited made a loss of pound, and this year we are forecast to lose a further pound,.\"The business is faced with an ever increasing cost base with increases in the National Minimum Wage, higher electricity costs and higher business rates.\"To add to these cost pressures the business is seeing local UK demand for hangers reducing.\"Many retailers are closing down shops or reducing their selling space and this means there are less hangers required.\"In addition, an increased emphasis on recycling means more hangers are being ed from stores for resorting, which further reduces manufacturing demand.\"Mainetti UK currently employs around  staff.Talks have already started with unions over the planned  redundancies.Mr Hutchison added: \"These changes will only impact the Jedburgh hanger manufacturing unit.\"All other products made in Jedburgh ndash flower buckets, polythene bags, Glastic and The Seatcase will not be impacted and in fact the company will continue to invest in all these areas during , in order to grow those parts of our Jedburgh manufacturing business.\"Local MP John Lamont has been in talks with the company over the past few days.He told us: ldquoThis is disappointing news from a long standing employer in Jedburgh.ldquoClearly their market is changing and Mainetti are having to adapt to that.

their Burnham on Sea microwave joke was worth the admission fee alone.These four crazy characters swayed towards slapstick, flirted with farce and brought down the house with a bombardment of belly-laughs.Despite all the fun and frivolity, though, Sleeping Beauty was still a sensational piece of stage theatre.Julia Noble and Steve Hartley-Oliver were authoritative and appealing as Queen Marigold and King Cactus.And the regular arrival of sinister Witch Hazel, played by both Tracey Borthwick and Julie Smith, in a cloud of customary green smoke made sure the young audience were kept on their toes.The couplet duels between the villainous Witch and Fairy Lilac, played exquisitely by Amanda Blacklock, were both clever and entertaining.Couplets aside, music was at the heart of Sleeping Beauty, from the opening Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer all the way through the seasonal finale, and many of the most memorable numbers came from Fairy Lilac and her supporting coloured fairies of Shannon Mack, Ruby Everett, Caitlin Green and Katie Wilson.From You Can Do Magic and Dream a Little Dream of Me to the luscious Hushabye Mountain, Amanda and her young apprentices were wonderful.A beautul rendition of Born with a Smile on My Face was the highlight of Aimee Richardsons all-to-short appearance as Young Rose.And the childrens fun-filled version of Wake Up You Sleepy Head was also among the many highlights of a fantastic night of musical theatre.The songs came thick and fast - as did the jokes.Hawick, Melrose and Tweedbank were ridiculed regularly, as were Theresa May, the Ladhope Vale one-way system and the residents of Abbotsford Court.The laughs were loud and the cheers, especially when Braw Lad and Braw Lass Greg Kelly and Kimberley OMay turned up for Roses Christening, were even louder.The choreography was both imaginative and eye-catching with dancers Emma Wilson, Jess Thomson, Rachel Falconer and Sara Facchini having obviously put in the rehearsal hours.The score was foot-tappingly good, the scene changes were swt and the stage was picture perfect.But ultimately its the actors, dancers and singers who take a production to new heights.And when the cast is enjoying themselves as much as the audience, the people behind the Right Angle Theatre Company can go to sleep this Christmas with a smile on their faces.CASTFairy Lilac: Amanda BlacklockWitch Hazel: Julie Smith Tracey BorthwickMuddles: Billy RooneyKing Cactus: Steve Hartley-OliverQueen Marigold: Julia NobleNurse Hettie Harpic: Jodie MillarFetch: Antony WilsonCarrie: Katie GordonFairy Red: Shannon MackFairy Yellow: Ruby EverettFairy Green: Caitlin GreenFairy Blue: Katie WilsonYoung Rose: Aimee RichardsonPrince Alexis: Stuart MitchellRose: Amy ThomsonDancers: Sara Facchini, Rachel falconer, Jess Thomson and Emma Wilson.Chorus: Ruaridh Anderson, Charli Black, Tracy Borthwick, Callum Crooks, Erin Gallagher, Nicole Hughes, Mya Lamb, Molly McFarlane, Lee-Anne Robinson, Millie Robinson, Ally Turnbull, Eilidh Walker.Children : Abigail Burns, Ellie Cockburn, Grace Decoteau, Rhianna Devlin, Faith Heriot, Fraser Scott Hermiston, Chloe Noble, Ceijay Robinson, Rebecca Scott, Max Turnbull and Ellie Welsh.: Simona Andom, Sophia Blaen, Georgie Everett, Skye Machara Henderson, Sky Hume, Chloe Johnston, Emily Johnstone, Lucy Johnstone, Ellie mcLaren, Molly McLaren, Carrie Smith and Isla Train.PRODUCTIONStage Crew: Billy Easson, Steven Headspeath, Craig Monks, Adam Nichol and Malcolm Wilson.Prompter: Sheila WilsonMake Up  Hair: Team from Millars Hair SalonMake Up Co-ordinator: Yvonne KeddieProps: Gordon Keddie and Sarah PhilipsChildrens Co-ordinator: Amanda BlacklockChildrens Organizer: Michelle DevlinPhotographs: Jade PringleGroup Bookings: Morag KeddieRaffle: Susan FalconerScenery: Border StudiosFront of House: Lana ThomsonKeyboards: Chris AchenbachPercussion: Graham Borthwick"},{"url":null,"title":"new-housing-estate-for-lauder-given-go-ahead","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has given the go-ahead to a brand new housing estate in Lauder.Members of the councilrsquos planning and building standards body voted unanimously to approve an application from Persimmon Homes to build  new homes just north of Thirlestane Drive.Seven people have objected to the development, with a further four expressing concerns, including Kimberly Shaw-Walker, of Thirlestane Drive.She wrote: ldquoThe site is not suitable for the volume of houses proposed.

This village has had  houses built here recently and now yoursquore asking us to find room for another .ldquoThe two main objections are about the surgery and the sewerage works.ldquoThere are people waiting six weeks to be seen by a doctor. We may have to wait longerthese houses are built. That could cost a le.ldquoThis must be knocked back because it is for the health of the village. Therersquos no way the village can take another  houses.ldquoThe second point is the sewerage works. It too cannot take another  houses.

project to fruition.#While our interest is focused on the sailing and powerboating aspects, we fully understand the benefits of working with other water based sports to create a community asset, within which we create synergies, economies and share skill sets.#It is a model that is worthy of replicating where and one which closely aligns with general development in community sport across Scotland.#We firmly believe the new Kintyre Seasports facility will create a hub within the community of Campbeltown where all members of the community can learn, practice, train and enjoy an active engagement in the sea.#Such opportunities are known to provide a tangible connection to improvements in health, social cohesion through volunteering and introduce many, particularly young people, to their first structured employment as instructors within their chosen water sport.#We are clear that developing grass roots opportunities within sailing and powerboating as well as other sports, provides young people with positive habits and skills that last a letime and iniably enhance employability.#We find the club environment is also an excellent place for the development of interpersonal skills, intergenerational relationships and to experience positive role models from many walks of le.#Families enjoy a place which is safe for children and supports the active participation of parents in sport, sustaining lelong participation and encouraging family cohesion through sharing of activity.#The uniqueness of sailing is that there are no barriers to participation.#Those aged from eight-years-old to , with disability or able bodied, LGBT or otherwise can share the same activity, learn and compete on an equal basis with minimal adjustments and are bonded by their love of boating.#There is every reason to expect that the Kintyre Seasports Project will be a shining example of inclusion.#The full potential of the project lies in the wider connections across the communities of interest the facility will serve.#Campbeltown sits on one of the most ied and interesting stretches of water in Scotland having benefits of both the shelter for Campbeltown Loch and immediate access to wider open sea in the Kilbrannan Sound and the Irish Sea.#In addition to becoming a hub of community activity, it is entirely conceivable that future events in dinghy racing, sea kayaking, coastal rowing and yacht racing will find a regular home in Campbeltown, facilitated by the skills and resources of the Kintyre Seasports Project.#RYA Scotland is excited by the prospects of

We are looking to be trading from March next year.Love Sweets and Ices has been trading on the opposite side of the road from the former bank for six years.However, a sweet shop on the site dates back more than  years.Mr Love said that the shop would be based in the front of the former bank, with rooms such as the managerrsquos office used for storage.Philip Mellor, chairman of the Dunbar Tradesrsquo Association , was pleased to see the building being brought back into use.He said: ldquoThe redevelopment of the old RBS bank on the High Street further demonstrates the demand for retail space in Dunbar.ldquoWe wish the new owners every success with the refurbishment of this iconic building and welcome the plans that Love Sweets and Ices has for the space.A decision to close  RBS and  NatWest branches came at the end of last year, with RBS branches in North Berwick and Dunbar shutting.The move was widely criticised by local politicians, with ward councillor Paul McLennan among those unhappy at the decision.In January, he said: ldquoThe social and community impact on the North Berwick and Dunbar communities of these branch closures will be substantial.ldquoThe RBS in Dunbar is in the centre of the town and will impact on the sustainability of High Street."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-gray-why-we-must-remember-srebrenica","story":"THIS year I attended many events in East Lothian marking the end of the First World War  years ago, not least the moving drumhead service by the Moderator of the Church of Scotland in Haddington on November .The following day, I found myself standing in remembrance as anotherModerator, the Very Rev Lorna Hood, said a few words on the exact spot where that war began, rather than ended.I was in Sarajevo, Bosnia, on the street corner where in  Serb nationalist Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Ferdinand, igniting the chain of events which engulfed the world in war for four long years.Our main purpose, though, was to learn about a much more recent conflict, the Balkans war of the s, on a delegation organised by the Remembering Srebrenica Scotland charity, which Lorna chairs.Just as the Second World War revealed that we had not learned from that first ldquowar to end all wars, so in  the Bosnian town of Srebrenica showed that we had not learned the lessons of the Holocaust, as genocide took place again on European soil while the world stood by and watched.Serbs, Croats and Bosnian Muslims had lived together peacefully. However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-fortnite-gifts-for-christmas-2018","story":"Fortnite is the most popular video game of the year and has taken over not just everyonersquos console, but Christmas lists up and down the country too.If you have family members, big or small, who are mad for Fortnite but find yourself utterly clueless as to what itrsquos all about or what to get someone who loves it for Christmas, we can help out with this guide to everything Fortnite from the game itself to presents you should buy this year.*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

This turned out to be an astonishing discovery.\"Irsquom sure other gems like this are waiting to be discovered in the burgh records which are an incredibly rich resource for historians and fully deserve their UNESCO designation as nationally important documentary heritage.The entry in which the ship is mentioned as having crossed the Atlantic relates primarily to debts incurred by Patrick Donaldson, a burgess of the town, and his fellow burgess William Findlay, the master and skipper of the ldquoWilliam.The records reveal that both Patrick and William were involved in the fitting-out and freighting of the vessel between it leaving Aberdeen in July , and itsin .The other partners and owners in the Newfoundland venture are given as Archibald Smith and burgess Alexander Kempt, while a Colin Campbell is noted as being on board the vessel, as was a carpenter by the name of John.Artists impression of The Gt of God, previously thought to be the first Scottish ship to cross the Atlantic to the New World. Pic: WikicommonsIn , when the ldquoWilliam made her long westward voyage, Scottish interests in North America were still very much in their infancy. The tentative trading contacts of the ship would have been making helped develop the settlements which became home to many in the Scottish diaspora during the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.Phil Astley, City Archivist, said: ldquoQuirky and unusual stories quite often come to light when reading through original records ndash itrsquos part of the fun of working in an archive, however, itrsquos rare to have a find as historically signicant as that made by Thomas.\"It is even more remarkable that we know the names of several crew members.The precise nature of the cargo on the outward voyage is not known although from later entries in the same volume it becomes clear that the ldquoWilliam ed to Aberdeen from North America via the port of Aveiro in Portugal where it picked up a cargo of salt, most probably destined to be used for preserving fish and meat.Remarkably, several of the Portugal to Aberdeen crew are also named: John Barclay, Alexander Currie, David Morton, David Easton, William Brown, Robert Fleming, Paul Fraser, William Young, and John Dow.It is possible that some may have been crew members on the Newfoundland voyage. They had paid money to Patrick Donaldson, one of the owners and the shiprsquos clerk, to buy their share of the shiprsquos cargo of salt.On arrival in Aberdeen the owners refused to pay the crew their whole share as the cargo was spoiled due to a leak in the shiprsquos hold. The dispute then came before the Burgh Court and was recorded in the Council Register.After the, the ships fate and that of its crew become obscure once more as it drops out of the record.Aberdeen remains a busy port todayLord Provost of Aberdeen, Barney Crockett, said the discovery cemented the citys place in Scotlands maritime history.He said: ldquoAberdeen is a proud maritime city, and this is a hugely important historical find.

Do not bellow at each other across the chamber.Given initial reactions to the spending plans for education in the Budget, Mr Swinney is likely to be involved in more heated exchanges in the coming weeks.The stakes are high. The Scottish Government has made the improvement of education its defining mission and in his statement to the Scottish Parliament Mr Mackay reiterated that objective.ldquoThis government has made clear that our priority is closing the attainment gap and improving education, he said.ldquoWe are determined to improve the le chances of children in Scotland and change the lives of our future generations for the better.This, he argued would be assisted by a ldquoreal terms increase in investment in the education portfolio for   with pound million to expand nursery education and over poundm for schools to improve performance and close the attainment gap - including poundm for the Pupil Equity Fundwhich channels money directly to schools in disadvantaged areas.This ldquoall is well approach was met with immediate scepticism from Mr Kelly who said council services were at ldquobreaking point with headteachers already writing to parents warning them of unprecedented cuts.The response from council umbrella body Cosla yesterday was equally downbeat with officials arguing the settlement amounted to a real terms cut once extra money for delivering new policies such as the roll-out of free nursery care were stripped out.Stephen McCabe, the organisationrsquos education spokesman, said: ldquoThey say they are putting additional money in, but it seems to be a rebranding of money that is already in the system, such as investment for PEF and the early years.ldquoThe simple reality is that when you strip out that money for new responsibilities local government revenue has been cut by poundm.ldquoThat cannot but impact on education given that it is such a large part of every councilrsquos budget. We were anticipating a poor settlement, but this is a very poor settlement.The other pressing concern for schools is the increasing likelihood of a teacher strike next year as unions move towards a ballot following the rejection of their demands for a ten per cent pay hike.Mr Mackay confirmed his public sector pay policy would provide no more than a three per cent rise for those earning pound, or less insisting it was ldquoreasonable and acceptable.Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland, strongly disagrees and sees nothing in the draft Budget that will delay the prospect of industrial action.ldquoWe are disappointed on the pay front and it reflects a degree of complacency on the governments part to the mood of public sector workers. It will fan the flames of discontent amongst teachers, he said.For headteachers the extra kick in the teeth is the Scottish Governmentrsquos refusal to adopt the Westminster Governmentrsquos increase in the higher rate of tax threshold which will squeeze salaries even further at a time when it is proving hard to recruit new school leaders.And Mr Swinney has a new headache. Last year, universities were relatively happy with the Budget because they believed ministers had finally acknowledged that further cuts in public funding was leaving them in a precarious position.Mr Mackayrsquos brief reference in his statement to ldquoover pound billion for universities neatly skirted over the fact this amounts to a real terms cut of . per cent.Universities are already having to rely on fees income from overseas student to subsidise the cost of teaching Scottish students and research funding is also under pressure.Professor Andrea Nolan, convener of Universities Scotland, said institutions would find it ldquodficult to deal with cuts which threatened the future viability of the countryrsquos world renowned higher education sector."},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-mckie-the-current-crop-of-conservative-mps-is-not-nearly-vicious-enough","story":"To comprehend something is not just to comprise or include it, but to grasp it by means of understanding.

If you smugly dismiss, for example, anyone who votes for Brexit or the SNP as a moronic bigot, it is your own political stance that is thoughtless and prejudiced.Thatrsquos not to say you canrsquot strongly object to and oppose thosepolitical positions, think them wrongheaded or even ndash though this judgment should be made with caution ndash wicked. If, however, you never pause to wonder why anyone might take a position contrary to yours, it doesnrsquot augur well for the foundations of your beliefs and, as a practical consideration, doesnrsquot give you the necessary equipment to build on them and withstand your opponentsrsquo claims.Which is why it is so baffling when something happens that seems genuinely incomprehensible. I refer, of course, to the  Conservative MPs who voted on Wednesday night to keep Theresa May as their leader. Try as I might, I cannot see any way in which this decision makes any sense.I think we can take it as read that only one of those  votes ndash that of the Rt Hon Theresa May, MP ndash was cast out of any genuine conviction that the Prime Minister is the right person for the job. So what can have been the motivation for the others If you wanted to make sure that Brexit went ahead, but to avoid departing on WTO terms ndash the ldquono deal exit those in the European Research Group either actively want, or are at least prepared to put up with ndash then voting for Mrs May guaranteed that you cannot get it. Of all the possible means of delivering Brexit, the one we know to be the worst, and the least likely to command support in the Commons, is the Prime Ministerrsquos.Even those who led the Leave campaign think that itrsquos a worse outcome than remaining. With the exception of halting free movement , it fails to deliver any of the fundamental elements of leaving, while removing any UK say in the policies, and costs. And potentially permanently,the Irish backstop were triggered. There is no equivalent of Article  for leaving the customs union, or the supervision of the EU Court of Justice,that happens. Sothe PM gets her withdrawal agreement through Parliament, you donrsquot get Brexit. Andshe canrsquot, you get to crash out ndash in which case, you might as well have voted against her, so that some kind of preparation could be made.If, on the other hand, you want to remain in the EU, or for some unfathomable reason think that a second referendum would improve matters, the only prospect of achieving those ends would have been to get shot of Mrs May, whose sole discernable quality is a pig-headed refusal ever to change her mind. A vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister might not have got Remainers what they want, but a vote for her more or less assured them that they wonrsquot.So much for the political positions or,yoursquore charitable, principles. But, though it may shock you to consider such a thing, MPs do not always vote purely in accordance with their beliefs. Venial, and indeed venal, considerations may also play a part.To put it bluntly, the question of whether they are going to hang on to their seats looms large in the thinking of most MPs, and Mrs Mayrsquos contribution to that ambition is hardly stellar. Quite apart from her record as the worst Prime Minister since, at the very least, David Cameron, shersquos also a shockingly bad tactician and an abysmal campaigner. This, remember, is the strategic genius who threw away a perfectly workable majority, and has since managed to annoy the DUP, on whose votes she now depends, more than any other group in the Commons.Whether any other Tory leader would give them a better chance at the next General Election is an open question . What a change would certainly have done, though, would have been to make a vote of no confidence from the Opposition much more dficult, probably allowing the Government to run its full term.Of course, one way Mrs May seems to have talked round her backbenchers is by promising them that she wonrsquot lead the party into the next General Election.

The article is primarily a criticism of the acrimony, isiveness and damage Brexit has already caused our nation, which is a fact, and concludes that the only rational solution to the impasse is for this important decision on our future to be ed to the people.Contrary to what your correspondent claims, at no point does Mr Mackay blame or denigrate those who in  sincerely voted Leave. Indeed, he explicitly acknowledges that ldquohow we are seen as a country ldquoshould shame every one of us whether we are Leavers or Remainers. The problem is how we solve this.We are in this unenviable and damaging position because of flawed, and essentially self-serving, judgments made by our presentgoverning party. It was the Conservatives who called a referendum promising a Brexit that, from the start, was inherently undeliverable. It was undeliverable because it necessarily compromised the Good Friday Agreement ndash something our present PM, a former Home Secretary, must have been fully aware of. Furthermore, important sectors of the electorate were denied a vote and the referendum was abused by both sides.Ultimately we are in this situation because we have an outdated electoral system which is fundamentally unrepresentative. That is why we have the mediocre Government and Opposition which have presided, and are presiding, over this mess, which they are now unable to cope with. It seems to me the EU has been remarkably tolerant towards us.Since the Brexit we were led to expect in  is not, and never will be, possible, why should the British people have to shut up and settle for a second-rate substitute we did not vote for and which will make our already stretched country even poorer  It is reasonable and democratic to ask people againthis is what we really wanted or expected.Robert Bell, Stewarton Drive,The Herald, Cambuslang.IN this total mess of Brexit let me inject a few hard facts. First, the whole process was started by David Cameron as a political move to thwart Ukip in the  General Election and to unite the Tory Party. It was not done in response to any demand from the general population for a referendum to leave Europe. In this purpose it has been a stunning failure.The promise that Brexit would cut the free movement of people and immigration was one of the driving forces behind the majority Leave vote. My second fact is that, whilst the number of Europeans coming to the UK has indeed dropped considerably, their place has been taken by people from other parts of the world and the net migration figure has stayed more or less constant. Those coming from non-EU countries are currently coming through UK borders that are \"controlled\" and in accordance with the UKs immigration policy.My final fact is that this whole process has cost pound. billion so far . In contrast, in his Budget the Chancellor gave a mere poundbn over five years to ease the transition into Universal Credit whilst the Governments policy to freeze benefits, which is continuing to  , cuts nearly poundbn a year from the benefits bill.All this misery to safeguard the Tory Party ndash is it worth it Judith Gillespie, Findhorn Place, Edinburgh.IF the UK does finally leave the EU with a backstop arrangement with Northern Ireland in place and the SNP is able to get independence through successfully and regain EU membership therein lies a problem.

complaints was biased because she had prior knowledge of them.Judge Lord Pentland ruled a batch of emails and notes will now be handed to an external commissioner, Morag Ross QC, to decide whether their contents are relevant.They were previously substantially redacted by the Scottish Government, which argued the documents arecovered by a confidentiality agreement.Lord Pentland said: ldquoEssentially, Irsquom satisfied that it is in the interest of justice for this to be done.ldquoI have given careful consideration to the fact that the respondent gave qualied assurance of

It isn’t intended to be a ‘straight’ narrative as you usually see, but as in a fairy tale there are strange detours, unexplained events, outcomes out of all proportion to what caused them – a kind of rough and dangerous magic working beneath the surface.Aside from that, each page of the book was crafted to be as inidually beautul as I could make it. Every page took at least a few days to create, and some pages took weeks, even months.Where did the inspiration for this book come from There are so many ideas that have fed into The Boy with Nails for Eyes that it’s very hard to pin it down to a single moment of inspiration. When I was at school, I was struck by a painting done by a previous student. It was a very unnerving picture — a spectral, jagged figure with crude smears of black where the eyes should be.Many years later I saw the music video for the Tool song Sober. There was a brief glimpse of a mechanical figure with a metal mask for a face, with one eye missing and the other pierced by this huge swivelling nail. I thought of Norse mythology — Odin, sacricing one of his eyes in the well of Mimir to gain wisdom. That second image married with the memory of the painting from school that same evening, I painted the first picture of The Boy with Nails for Eyes. A few weeks later, the story began to slowly take shape.It’s changed beyond recognition over the years, taking on influences such as the War on Terror of the early s. I was born in Bahrain and was there during the Gulf War. We were all issued with gas masks by the American military, and I remember waking up one night to find the rest of my family in my room, my mum holding the masks, my dad stuffing a towel under the door. It turned out Iraq had launched a Scud — we were all terried of the thought of chemical weapons. I recognised that same feeling of paranoia in the days after September the th, and Bush’s declaration of the War on Terror. That feeling pervades the story.How did the crowdfunding for this book come about I had been shopping the comic around to agents and publishers for a long time. I found it to be a frustrating process. I tended to receive positive responses, which were still rejections. I was running out of options, and was wondering where I’d go nextI wasn’t able to place it with anyone. I received a boost when the book was long-listed for the Myriad First Graphic Novel competition earlier this year.I was speaking to an editor at Unbound, the publisher, about an entirely dferent project — an illustrated poem. Almost as an aside I mentioned that I had this other graphic novel whose first volume was finished and ready to go. I showed her the first couple of chapters and she fell in love with it . We decided to temporarily shelve the other project and proceed with this.What would it mean to you to see this book published It would be fantastic. I’ve been working on the project over  years, since my early twenties. It’s been a labour of love — for myself and my we Anna as well, who had major input into the work. I honestly had no thought of publishing it properly, it was just important to me to allow it to be exactly the story it needed to be. I basically taught myself digital art by working on it, and honed my drawing and writing skills through it. It sounds strange, but I’m as much its product as it is mine. Having it out there as a book, something physical that can be picked up and read, would make it real in a way that it isn’t yet, for all that I’m satisfied that the story is what it should be – or near as I can make it.To find our more about The Boy with Nails for Eyes and support Shaun#s project visit: www.unbound books nails-for-eyes copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From Raiders of the Lost Ark to The Crystal Skull, these movies provided swashbuckling, testosterone-fuelled adventures that kept us, the audience, glued to the screen. Would Indiana win through against the odds, overcoming the baddies and cheats  The more I think about it, with all the spiders, creepy crawlies and snakes he had to deal with, it was like a precursor for I’m a Celebrity ... get me out of here! My favourite Indiana Jones movie was Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade starring Sir Sean Connery. Long and short, they go after the Holy Grail, the cup of Christ, andone drinks from it, one has eternal le. And living longer seems to be in vogue not only for Indiana, but for us all. Hence the current fascination with all sorts of potions and exercise routines to keep us fit into our nineties. Who needs the Holy Grail when we have Davina MCall DVDs The search for the Holy Grail, which in today’s money, means living a healthy le to the top end of the le expectancy charts cannot be achieved by drinking from an alleged mythical chalice. No, to become the fittest person in the old folks Home, one has to live a le that resembles a Cistercian monk’s. Just how happy the monks are is a matter for interpretation. But, let’s explore this ... for the sake of a longer le.My own expectation of a long and healthy le was set at . Yes, I was pretty happy to be healthy to , then head downhill and be dead by . Some of you maybe thinking this was a wee bit too pessimistic, especially when the le expectancy for Scotland has males topping out at  years of age and in Spain, where I now live, a whopping  years. But, I had reasons for my own personal le expectancy. I was more focussed on how useful me and my body would actually be at . I anticipated that my mind would deteriorate, my water works would be dysal and my sex le would be, well, a Mills and Boon book at bedtime with my cocoa. I would dribble when I drank my tea and spill gravy down my front at the Christmas table, while others placed large napkins on my chest and stomach to catch it all. : You don’t need to pull on trainers to stay healthy, finds studySo,  sounded okay and probably a good estimation of my usefulness and mobility.

Like I said, it’s a bit monk-like! But, nevertheless it appears that there are five areas of our lives that we can proactively improve to add years to our time on this earth. And not just years of visiting doctors for statins and high-blood pressure pills either. So, I’m now going to provide you with a sort of Holy Grail of longer le. Notebooks out... here it is: eat a healthy diet get regular exercise maintain a healthy body weight don’t smoke and drink alcohol in moderation.And there was you thinking it was going to be a ground-breaking, Indiana Jones ‘woohoo journey’ into good times. But alas, there is nothing new here. However, the research showed that people who made a conscious effort to abide by these lestyle choices, lived longer.

If you’re a man, your le expectancy increases from . to . years. Yes, women get  additional years and men get  more years. So, there is the opportunity to live a longer and more healthy le well into your eighties.I am smug enough to share with you that I think I’m doing okay with the first four on the list. But, the yummy Monestrall red wine that I now favour is probably setting me back a bitI’m honest. But this leads to another eye-opener that the research has thrown up. Certainly,you can live like a monk and adhere to all five long-le determinants, then bully for you.But, the majority of us may only be able to achieve three out of the five. Researchers found a “dose-response relationship” between each inidual healthy lestyle behaviour and a reduced risk of early death. In non researcher-speak, that means any lestyle improvements you make will positively impact your le expectancy. Bonus! A bit of good fortune that plays out better than three numbers in the National Lottery.Making lestyle choices is hard. It takes determination and discipline, hence my monk analogy. A couple of glasses of red wine is good, when compared to seven pints down the pub on a Friday and Saturday night.Taking a -minute walk each day in the wind and rain isn’t easy and takes motivation. But, the research seems to show that these changes, when all put together, increase the opportunities for a longer, healthier le. My question to you for today or this weekend: will you give serious thought to adopting at least three out the five healthy lestyle choices If so, I wonderthe -year-old you will say – thanks!©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4843774.1544715363!/image/image.jpg","title":"kevan christie what plato had to say about brexit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The European Court of Justice ruling that Brexit can be unilaterally halted by the UK, # meaning we can put a stop to our two-year bender and come home with our tail between our legs # should have led to parties in the street.It means the UK has our very own ‘get out of jail free’ card, allowing us to get back with the EU – provided we agree to behave, drink a bit less and do more jobs around the house. What an opportunity.But no, rather than grasp this chance to jump into the leraft, Theresa May and her kamikaze special attack unit decided to ignore the ruling and plough on with their own version of ‘Deal or No Deal’.Off she went to get Angela Merkel telt over the Irish border backstop so she could eventually call a vote in the Commons that might have a chance of going through, thus avoiding an embarrassing defeat. However, her failure to negotiate the car door on arrival in Germany left her with a bigger riddy than any gubbing she would face in Parliament, including the confidence vote.This immediately put her on the back foot in terms of trying to renegotiate our messy orce settlement and likely blew any chance she may have had of gaining custody of the Simply Red CDs. But she might still get that DVD of Funeral in Berlin.I imagine she felt the same as a ScotRail passenger tasked with opening a train door with an outside handle, while a group of angry office workers wait to alight.At this rate, May will be “coming to a garden centre near you shortly” to while away the time drinking coffee and eating traybakes when she is eventually handed her jotters.Meanwhile, the Irish passport office has been inundated with Scots asking for their  Euros back after realising they were a tad hasty in pretending to be from the Emerald Isle, just to get past airport security a bit quicker.“But I’ve never even been there, my grandad died before I was born and no I haven’t met my cousin Plunkett ... I don’t even like Guinness.” Of course, I jest but this Brexit malarkey is no laughing matter.: Brexit deal still in limbo as May refuses to name new vote dateAs self-appointed spokesperson for ‘most people’ – in this case, the ones who voted for Remain – I’d like to say I did so in the belief that voting to stay in the European Union was the right thing to do. Born and bred in the Athens of the North, I consider myself an enlightened Renaissance man of upper working-class stock. I can order both a coffee with milk and the bill in Spanish and have been to the Majorcan holiday resort of Santa Ponsa no less than  times. You don’t get more European than that.However, my knowledge of the EU was scant to say the least and,forced to name a Member of the European Parliament before the referendum, I would have said ... Nigel Farage and left it there. It was something to do with Ted Heath, that rang a bell in the back of my mind, and I always found the Sun headline ‘Up Yours Delors’ funny.So, no I didn’t really have a clue what I was voting for other than to maintain the status quo. This is why I find it a bit rich when fellow Remoaners belittle those who voted Leave with the standard accusation that they, like me, didn’t know what they were voting for.Granted some of them didn’t have a clue and fell for the populist propaganda around the immigration issue and not wanting to let “that Isis” into the UK.There was all the nonsense around migrants being military men of fighting age as opposed to -year-old bairns looking for shelter – so they must have been part of “that Isis”, looking to set up a caliphate in Sunderland. Here’s to you, Tommy Robinson. : EU has fun with Theresa May’s Brexit plightThen there was the £ million sent to the EU every week that could supposedly be spent on the NHS, according to Boris and the battle bus. A mere drop in the ocean – NHS Tayside chiefs would have spent that in a fortnight.But there were genuine concerns around the make-up of the EU, seen by some as a bastion of corrupt neoliberalism as national populism swept across countries like Hungary, Italy, Poland and Austria before landing in the good old US of A. No less a figure than Jeremy Corbyncan barely disguise his contempt for the European Union and the current new version of Old Labour has concerns about the threat migration poses to skilled workers in the frozen north of England.Of course, the real baddie in all of this is David Cameron.‘Cam the Bam’ made the schoolboy error of asking the public what they thought. He offered them a choice to keep things as they were or opt for the specials board at the local Wetherspoons, which was offering homemade sticky toffee pudding and ice-cream with a hard Brexit.This was an open goal to Vote Leave who were ahead of the curve in judging the public to be fed up with elites and feeling their elective representatives did not speak up for blue-collar workers or indeed no-collar workers in the shape of the so-called underclass.Back in BC, Plato the Greek philosopher knew his onions when it came to referenda and the masses. He believed that “a good decision is based on knowledge and not on a number” and was scared that a majority of people would make poor choices and could be too easily influenced by demagogues. This is something characters like Farage and Trump have exploited to the maximum but old Plato predicted this kind of thing all those years ago. And yet people still express surprise at the results of the EU referendum and the US election.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4844242.1544792819!/image/image.jpg","title":"cost of staging brexit referendum in scotland around 10m","story":"The cost of staging the EU referendum in Scotland amounted to around # million, according to figures published by the Electoral Commission.The statistics give detail on the expenditure for administering the vote, including running polling stations across the country and issuing postal votes.Scotland voted by % to % to stay within the EU, with all  council areas voting to remain.The Electoral Commission calculates the cost per vote in Scotland was £. - with a total of ,, people voting, adding up to a total of around £. million.Regional counting officers’ expenses for Scotland added up to £,. -a total that amounted to £. over its funding allocation.The total UK cost of delivering the vote on the EU in June  totalled around £ million.The Electoral Commission will submit its recommendations on spending to the Cabinet Office to be considered for future elections.Asked whether Prime Minister Theresa May regarded the cost of staging the referendum as good value for money, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: “The decision to hold a referendum was taken by the previous government.“What is important now is that we are focused on delivering the result.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4843976.1544739028!/image/image.jpg","title":"new measures planned to create zero tolerance of harassment at scottish parliament","story":"Complaints of sexual harassment against MSPs and former MSPs will be investigated independently and no longer time-barred under changes designed to introduce a culture of #zero tolerance#.The Joint Working Group on Sexual Harassment recommends that complaints against MSPs be referred to the Commissioner for Ethical Standards and that the one-year limit on raising complaints be scrapped.A report published yesterday says complaints against former MSPs or former members of staff should also be investigated.However, it notes that in such cases parliamentary sanctions can no longer be applied, citing a case where Holyrood’s standards committee decided it couldn’t do anything. Earlier this year, the committee found there was a lack of confidence in the way complaints are handled.It followed the resignation from the SNP of former minister Mark McDonald after he admitted causing a woman “considerable distress” after sending inappropriate text messages.Former First Minister Alex Salmond is currently taking legal action against the Scottish Government after it initiated complaint proceedings following allegations of sexual misconduct. Mr Salmond has denied any wrongdoing.Following a confidential survey of people working at Holyrood, the new report calls for the introduction of “an overarching policy on sexual harassment,” setting out a zero tolerance policy.It calls for the creation of an independent support service as a route which people can use to make a formal complaint.And it says formal complaints should be investigated independently of parliament and political parties, meaning by the Commissioner for Ethical Standards for MSPs. A joint letter to staff from Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh and Scottish Parliament chief executive Paul Grice said: “Important as policies and procedures are, we each have a duty to ensure our own behaviour meets the standard expected and to challenge the behaviour of others that falls short. “And, while we want to ensure that any complaint is dealt with sensitively and fairly, we remain focussed on our goal of preventing sexual harassment happening in the first place. Achieving that will require the combined efforts of the parliament, the political parties and all those who work in and visit Holyrood and we are grateful for your continued support.”A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “We are committed to ensuring that everyone has the right to live their le free of abuse, harassment and intimidation, and expect all employers to provide safe and supportive environments for their employees.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4841479.1544439622!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon support scottish independence and avoid narnia with idiots","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scotland#s First Minister branded Tory politicians #idiots# as she called on Scots to support independence.Following an article in the Sundaywhere allies of Boris Johnston likened him to Aslan in CS Lewis’s Narnia series ready to end he rule of the ice queen Theresa May, Nicola Sturgeon took to Twitter, to say Scottish voters could “opt to stay in the real world.”She wrote: “It’s hard to know whether to laugh or cry.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration.

Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Aimee-Fewell-4-Auchtertyre-primry.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8734911.1544460417!/image/image.jpg","title":"jonathan rea honorary degree i feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it s nice to be recognised","story":"Four-time World Superbike champion Jonathan Rea has received an honorary degree for his outstanding contribution to sport.The Co Antrim racer received the honorary degree of Doctor of Lettersfrom Ulster University at its winter graduation ceremony.World Superbike Champion Jonathan Rea collects his Honorary Graduate from the University of UlsterOf the occasion at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast, he said: “It’s dficult to stand in a room full of highly educated people and receive an award like that when I haven’t gone to university. “But I have served my time.

Speaking at the event Cllr Millar said: “Ballymena was judged in the Large Town category this August by RHS judges, Rae Beckwith and James Cordingley. Ballymena went on to win the Gold Award at the prestigious UK-wide RHS Britain in Bloom Awards which were held in Belfast on  October.“Ballymena also won the ‘Gardening for Wildle’ award in recognition of commitment to wildle.“The Gold Award is a fantastic achievement and puts Ballymena up there as one of the UK’s best large towns.”The judges hailed Berries and Blooms Allotment Gardens at Drumtara as ‘the most remarkable allotment site’ which they have no doubt will be a model going forwardThe judges were very impressed by the committed group of bird ringers operating at Ecos Nature Park, as well as the Bioersity Summer School which is held each summer on site, and the judges were also very impressed by the education and le experiences being made available at The Base Garden at The People’s Park.In terms of business involvement in town, the judges felt the BID’s work was made very evident, with shops and businesses showing increasing interest.

AndEamonn Higgins of Hot Milk Forge has his way, the skills of yesteryear will be passed down to future generations - thanks in part to global TV hit ‘Game of Thrones’ with its sword and sorcery primetime magic. Hot Milk Forge is a Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing School based on the Lisnamanny Road in Ballymena.It runs evening, weekend and day classes in Basic to Advanced Artist Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing and people have been travelling to the courses from all over the world.Speaking to the Ballymena , Eamonn said he loves teaching his craft to keen and intrigued novices.I have been a professional artist and sculptor since .For  years Blacksmithing has formed an integral part of my practice with public works scattered across the UK and commercial works collected internationally, Eamonn explained.However I love taking the courses and teaching people a new skill, something they wouldnt ever experience.The -year-old said he recently had a lady travel all the way from Kerry to make her own unique creations.This woman drove a long way to do the course and she made a number of intricate brooches and pieces of art that she can treasure.I have many people that sign up to the course who are big fans of Game of Thrones and TV shows like that but a lot of people just want to try something dferent, Eamonn said.At the minute we are making mostly knives which seems to be the trendy item at the minute.“This has probably come from the huge interest in Game of Thrones.”Eamonn has been approached by the HBO series to make specic items for the show and has had many of the actors who appeared on the show taking his courses.Hot Milk Forge offers evening and Weekend Classes in Blacksmithing with an artistic twist. Evening classes are open to everyone above the age of . Participants are encouraged to learn the traditional skills not just because the celebration of wrought iron work is a worthy idea but also because only blacksmithing can introduce you to the full potential of steel as a creative medium. At the forge they weld with a fire and not with electricity. Imagine making your own fire side set, wrought iron gate, gts for your partner, sculpture, the list goes on.FAMILY FARMHot Milk Forge is located on Eamonns family farm and the workshop is where the first milking parlour was located many moons ago. His childhood years growing up surrounded by natural beauty of the nearby Antrim Hills continue to influence his work which often looks primeval, resembling the misshapen bodies of humans and animals miraculously preserved in Irish bogs for thousands of years. I try to give my work a certain austerity, a terrible beauty that is timeless and that can be associated with Irish art through the millennia. “As I come from a rural background, the landscape and its people speak more to me than some of the more conceptual art in vogue. “As a child I grew up playing in mud in haystacks and running about the fields. “I absorbed all of this subconsciously and it comes out in my work.”Eamonn has been demonstrating and teaching blacksmithing as part of his Public Art practice as long as he has been blacksmithing.In  on completion of a two year artist residency in the University of Ulster Eamonn decided it was time his blacksmithing classes had a permanent home Hot Milk Forge was born.

For after much soul searching and deliberating, Christina has decided to take her love for her community on to the next level by becoming a Sinn Féin City Hall rep. Christina has been co-opted on to Belfast City Council in place of the outgoing Councillor Mary McConville, who has stepped down for health reasons.“I’ve been involved in community work for twenty-three years now. One of my earliest memories is of me at five years old walking down the Grosvenor holding a sign that said, ‘We want heat not cold feet’ – my mummy had me involved in community work from no age, it’s in my blood,” Christina told the Andersonstown News, smiling at the memory.“I attended my first Belfast City Council meeting at the beginning of December. I was a bit nervous speaking, but I got through it. It was very interesting watching the dynamics of the Council.”Christina identied some of the issues that pushed her over the line when it came to making the decision to enter City Hall.“There are local issues that I want to make an impact on. I have given this a lot of thought and I discussed it with my husband before I made my decision, we both agreed that it’s the right path for me, I feel that it is a natural progression.“I want to make a dference and I want to carry on the good work of Mary McConville. I live in this area so I am well aware of the local issues and I find them as much a challenge as everyone .“I believe you should feel safe in your area, you should feel happy, you should benefit from generated investment. There are huge developments happening in the city centre, these should be impacting the areas around it to a greater extent, and I feel I can represent people fully in that respect.”Christina’s much-missed mother Belle was a renowned voluntary community worker –chairperson of the Roden Street Development Group at Grosvenor Community Centre.“My mother taught me that community is everything, she also taught me that a community worker is never off duty. She never feared going the extra mile to ensure that people got what they deserved.“I have been described as being parochial, which I don’t think is true, I am very open minded in my thinking. But I would agree I am there to represent local voters, so to a certain extent I must be parochial to genuinely bring that local voice forward.”Christina continued: “I’m the kind of person who works hard, but my mother, well, she worked tirelessly.Her door never stopped, people always turned to her.She gave everything andI can be half the woman she was I will be happy. I’m going to have to learn to manage my work-le balance, though.“Since my mummy passed away I have tried to continue her good work, she showed me the ropes and I think she would be delighted to see me take on this role. At the end of the day I work for this community and I promise to do all I can to ensure the people get what they are entitled to.“There’s a gap between the Grosvenor Road and the city centre that is crying out for investment. The Belfast Transport Hub is going in, which I believe will generate employment. I would love for our young people to be in a position to become engineers and the like. I would love to find a way to get them that training to elevate them to those amazing employment opportunities.“I really want better for our people, I am so proud of being from Roden Street and I will never leave the Grosvenor Community Centre, it’s been too many people’s le’s work. I want to do my Council work to the best of my abilities in my own time.“I’m going to try my hardest to do the best job possible for the people of this area and beyond.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new report lays out bright future for west belfast","story":"A NEW report detailing the positive transformation that has taken place in West Belfast in recent years will be launched on tomorrow morning . ‘Vision : Transforming West Belfast’ will look to the future as well as outlining projects such as the James Connolly Interpretive Centre, Casement Park and the Roddy McCorley Society interactive museum and visitor centre.The report has been commissioned by Fáilte Feirste Thiar and the West Belfast Partnership Board and will highlight the amount of investment that has gone into the West of the city.Projects in the spotlight in the report include:•£m from Belfast City Council for the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre•m from the Department for Communities and Ciste for Áras na BhFál• £m for the Balmoral Hotel•£.m for the Blackmountain Shared Space Project•£m investment for Brook Leisure Centre•£m for the Falls Park City Cemetery MasterplanIn total, the report will list  projects in West Belfast that have benefited from investment.Speaking to the Andersonstown News ahead of the launch, Harry Connolly, Executive Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, said: “In recent years West Belfast has began to secure increased amounts of public sector investment.“Research undertaken for this publication has uncovered that this combined investment totals over £ million – a signicant figure.“Many people involved in our local private, public and community sectors will not be fully aware of the huge amount of work involved nor the scale of the investment secured. The Vision : Transforming West Belfast publication captures, articulates and plots out in a user-friendly format the depth of investment, the impact of this investment and, importantly, a timetable for delivery.“Only projects that have been secured are showcased. Vision : will act as a catalyst in helping to leverage further investment.”Jim Girvan, Operations Director with the West Belfast Partnership Board, said: “West Belfast has seen transformational change over the past twenty years with its buildings, structure, style and landscape, and we want to encourage this growth in partnership with local communities.“West Belfast is an amazing place where people have business accolades and creative solutions, which creates the perfect place for people to live, work, invest, visit and enjoy.”Welcoming the launch of the report, MP for West Belfast Paul Maskey added: “As MP for this constituency I have the privilege of having knowledge of all of these projects and an appreciation of the sheer volume of effort and dedication that goes into making each and every one of these projects a success.“I am of the firm belief that Vision : is only the beginning, the first phase and perhaps the most important, of a tangible transformation in West Belfast that puts local people central to development and builds a unique model that allows our resilience and spirit to grow.”Vision : Transforming West Belfast will be launched on Friday, December , at .am in An Chultúrlann, Falls Road."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"oap summonsed for feeding the horses","story":"A WEST Belfast animal lover is calling on Belfast City Council to drop their case against him after he received a littering summons for feeding horses in a field.Ballymurphy man Seamus Conlon was feeding a friend’s horses in a field on the Hannahstown Hill in June of this year when he was approached by two men who asked him to stop what he was doing.Seamus says he told the men to mind their own business but later received a fixed penalty fine in the post which he refused to pay. He’s now been issued with a summons and was due to appear in court on Wednesday morning – but the hearing was adjourned for the second time.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, a gobsmacked Seamus said: “I’ve kept horses all my le, they are beautul creatures. I am in poor health and looking after these horses brings me a real sense of joy.”Seamus lives with COPD, is diabetic and has suffered multiple heart attacks.He continued: “I was giving bread to the horses, minding my own business, and these two characters approached me and demanded I stopped. This field belongs to my friend and I have permission to feed these horses. What harm was I doing  I don’t need the stress and strain of this.”Seamus described the encounter that led to the series of events that has left him baffled and angry.“I pulled my car up that morning and walked over to feed the horses, these two fellas shouted over at me and told me to stop. I told them to take themselves off, they said they were ringing the peelers and I told them to get whoever they wanted. One of the men said the birds were lting the bread I was feeding the horses and dropping it in his garden, absolute nonsense. I got into my car and drove off. Your man must have taken my car registration because I received a fixed penalty notice in the post.”Seamus added: “I turned up to court on the arranged date and the complainant never bothered turning up. I showed up again on Tuesday and the same thing, he never weighed in again. NowI didn’t bother turning up I’m sure they’d have something to say about that. This is a complete and utter waste of Belfast City Council time and money and I am urging them to drop it.”Local People Before Profit Councillor Matt Collins said: “This whole situation is ridiculous, whoever made the decision to issue a court summons to Seamus perhaps needs a basic crash course in what constitutes illegal or criminal behaviour. This summons should be withdrawn and Belfast City Council should apologise to Seamus immediately.“It’s also worth saying that Seamus is taking this in his stride and isn’t backing down – and fair play to him for that. But other people would likely be intimidated by this. Nobody wants brought up in front of a court and especially for something so absurd. I’d imagine the vast majority of people would agree with me that Belfast City Council and the powers-that-be in this city ought to put their time and energy into something more productive, instead of hauling a pensioner up in front of a court for feeding horses.”A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said that as this is an ongoing matter they would not be making any comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the fureys uniting generations through music","story":"DESPITE its relatively small population, ours has never been a country with a shortage of musicians on the international stage, but few of them have had an impact as lasting as The Fureys.Formed in the , the iconic folk group has entertained audiences throughout the world for  years. While the band’s line-up has inevitably changed over the years, brothers George and Eddie Furey have continued to tour the globe, bringing the finest ballads to generations old and new.To celebrate their th anniversary they have released a new album, ‘The Fureys  Years On… to be continued’, and will play a headline gig at Belfast’s Waterfront this January.Ahead of the gig, the Andersonstown News met with George and Eddie, who had just ed from the Netherlands leg of their jubilee tour. While their music has touched thousands,not millions of people, George and Eddie are a pair without air and graces. Our chat was an informal one that took place in the Waterfront Hall’s lobby, with school kids, excited by their trip to the panto, providing an excitable background hum. As for the story of The Fureys – it’s one of famous faces, infamous sessions, and more years worth of craic than can be adequately depicted in a single newspaper article. However, with the release of their new album – which foregoes many of the obvious tracks and is jammed full of new material – our conversation almost immediately turned to things more current.“A lot of the songs we would’ve heard as kids and would’ve grown up singing them,” Eddie explained.“Streets of London is one of them, which was written by Ralph McTell, and we know Ralph going back many, many years.”George added: “The first track on the album was written by a Donegal man, Jordy Gallagher, and he wrote the song about eight years ago. “Joe, our manager knows him very well and he gave our manager the song to have a listen to because he thought it might suit on the album because it’s a protest song. A lot of those songs from years ago are all protest songs, from the s.“We grew up with all these protest years ago. There was a great song years ago called The Eve of Destruction, and it’s about what would happen to ussomeone dropped the big bomb – we grew up with those songs. So this song really suits the album.”“The Day’s Gonna come is a great song,” Eddie concurred. “The song tells you what’s happening to the world and those older songs tell you what was happening at that time. The words are ‘the day is gonna come when the water runs out and the wells run try, man’s so dumb, fish can’t swim and birds can’t fly’.”He continued: “There’s also peace songs, love songs, and drinking songs. “We’ve sang an awful lot of love songs over the years too. Songs that our mother used to sing and our father used to sing, Sweet Sixteen and that sort of stuff.”Although it’s an anniversary album, the new CD is new territory for The Fureys, who had not previously recorded much of its material. But much like their previous albums, The Fureys have continued to record songs from some of world’s best songwriters.“The songs are mostly from people we’ve met over the years on our tours,” Eddie said.“We’ve sang a lot of great ballads over the years.“We even recorded an album of Charlie Chaplin songs. Josie, Charlie Chaplin’s second youngest daughter, was cleaning out her father’s house and she found five songs that were never recorded before, written by Charlie Chaplin, and she asked uswe would do the songs. We had to do them, and we had to do them with an orchestra. We had a -piece orchestra in the studio with us recording these great songs.”George added: “We do a mix of stuff – not just Irish songs. If you listen to some of the bands now they’re going back on the old stuff. To me, you can’t beat the real thing.”Unlike some older musicians and music fans, The Fureys are not consumed with thoughts of past ‘glory days’. On the contrary, George admits that music is “probably more versatile now”. Instead the past only serves to make their current concerts more fulfilling as they bring together people who have followed them through the generations.“A lot of the kids that come to see us now, their grandparents or parents would’ve come to our concerts and bought our albums,” George said. “Now we have kids coming to concerts with their grandma and grandpa.”Eddie noted: “People grew up with our stuff and they love to see it live.”The Fureys have united generations and their music has been played everywhere from their hometown in Dublin to the International Space Station – where astronaut Chris Hadfield famously played their track ‘Steal Away’ – but of all other places outside of their hometown, it’s in Belfast where they feel most at home.“We’ve been up here so many times it’s like our second home,” George insisted.“We used to play in the Ulster Hall before this was built. We used to bring the wives up to do the Christmas shopping, because it was cheaper up here. Then we’d smuggle it across the border. If you got caught at customs they’d take it off you – drink and everything – party time. We had some parties like.”He continued: “This is our tenth gig here, which I never knew until this morning. It was only opened up when we first played here. They know what to expect – people are used to coming to see us. They always ask for some of the old songs, and we have to do them. People will ask for some dferent songs too, and we can do them no problem.”Eddie added: “We’ll be singing some songs off the new album too. You have to add them in here and there. If a request comes up for an old song we like to keep people happy.”The Furey’s play at the Waterfront Hall on January , .

Were all going to break our hearts over the decision to close, but unfortunately the shutters must come down.\"Club chairman Jim McLarenand trustee and committee member Ed Boyleboth agreed that it would be terribly sad to say a final farewell to the club and its members on December .\"Were hoping that it will be kept as a sports bar and then we will still use it,\" Jim said.\"Otherwise, well probably see other again at funerals and things like that,\" Ed added."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast mans first christmas with birth mum ruined by gangs","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They are contained in the conclusions of yesterday evening.“That is our position. That is what we have put on the table. And now we expect Great Britain to respond.”Belgium’s PM Charles Michel said: “The ball is now politically in the British court.”And Mr Tusk said he had “no mandate” to organise any further negotiations.Mrs May’s hopes of a legally binding commitment on the backstop from the EU were dashed on Thursday, when Mr Juncker said there could be “no real changes” to the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated over  months.It seems that the Prime Minister has failed in her bid to deliver meaningful changes to her Brexit deal. We cannot go on like this. The Prime Minister should reinstate the vote on her deal next week and let Parliament take back control.— Keir StarmerDecember , The Prime Minister addressed the EU leaders on Thursday about MPs’ concerns  about the backstop which had prevented her getting her Brexit deal through Parliament this week.Mr Tusk said the leaders had expressed a “firm determination” to work “speedily” to ensure there is an agreement on the future relationship in place by the time the transition period ends in December , so the backstop is not needed.But Mr Juncker criticised Britain’s lack of clarity over what it was seeking from the future relationship.“Our UK friends need to say what they want, instead of asking us to say what we want,” he said.“So we would like, within a few weeks, our UK friends to set out their expectations for us because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise and I would like clarications.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker embraces council president Donald Tusk at the Brussels summit The EU hardball approach appears to leave Mrs May with limited room for manoeuvre during the countdown to the UK’s departure on March .The Prime Minister told the summit that a package of assurances around the backstop could “change the dynamic” at Westminster.At the same time, she made clear a failure by EU leaders to offer concessions risked the collapse of the whole agreement, with the UK leaving in March in a disorderly, no-deal Brexit.Mrs May managed a smile at her press conference when a reporter askedshe had had a “trying week”, jokingly replying: “Has something happened this week ”When asked whether the problems with her party at home and dealing with the EU had made her want to quit as leader, she said it is “our duty as a Government and as a Parliament” to see Brexit through.WATCH LIVE: PM @Theresa_May holds a press conference following EU Council https:t.co irtqNcSv— UK Prime MinisterDecember , She added: “I never said it was going to be easy.“Negotiations like this are always tough. There are always dficult times and as you get closer to the very end, that can get even more dficult because you are sorting out the last details of something.”Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May’s plan was “dead in the water” after she “utterly failed in her attempts to deliver any meaningful changes”, and reiterated Labour’s call for it to be put to a vote before Christmas.PM @Theresa_May has met leaders including @donaldtusk and @Xavier_Bettel at @EUCouncil today and discussed what is needed to get the Brexit deal over the line pic WMInAvAJkj— UK Prime MinisterDecember , Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington rejected that idea and defended Mrs May’s handling of the talks, telling Today: “Anybody who has heard Theresa May in debate, anybody who has heard her around the Cabinet table, knows there is a very clear plan.”He described the talks as “a welcome first step that was the removal of uncertainty” over the EU’s intentions, because it has shown it wants a “speedy UK trade deal” that would remove the need for the backstop in the first place."},{"url":null,"title":"mays postbrexit trade deal suggestion dismissed by taoiseach","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said he was not clear what the DUP leader was saying in regard to her oversight of Dr Andrew Crawford.\"She has a saying that she is accountable but not responsible,\" he said. \"I, for myself, am not entirely clear what that might mean.\"He pressed DUP barrister Julie Ellison over whether Mrs Foster should share more of the blame for a number of failings. These included not picking up on warnings from the whistleblower Janette OHagan, a lack of record-keeping at ministerial meetings and not realising Dr Crawford hadnt read detailed RHI reports.Ms Ellison said Mrs Foster felt Ms OHagan deserved a \"sincere apology\", that she was unaware officials werent taking minutes, and it was for the  to decide whether Mrs Foster gave proper instructions to Dr Crawford.Regarding the \"shadowy world\" of special advisers, Ms Ellison told the  they had broken the rule of never becoming the story.Former DUP minister Jonathan Bell has claimed top DUP Spad Timothy Johnston directed another adviser, Timothy Cairns, not to introduce cuts and to work instead with fellow adviser Dr Crawford.Ms Ellison said Mr Johnston had no interest or influence over RHI in the summer of . A barrister for Mr Cairns went on to say he acted \"reasonably and appropriately\" over RHI, but agreed some aspects could have been carried out better."},{"url":null,"title":"there is a job to be done theresa may confirms further talks as uk ramps up no deal preparation","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He is also a member of Victoria Park and Tower Hamlets AC which won the South of England Athletic Association Fell Running Championships on the Isle of Wight in September, with Aaron winning the inidual title. These championships comprise three races in two days, with the first two races on Saturday and the third and longest, on Sunday.The races are not by any means easy inidually, or collectively, the first being .k, but with an ascent of  metres, the second k with an ascent of  metres and the third, on the following day, k with a m ascent.Aaron was first and second respectively in the first two of the races and he calculated that he could win overallhe finished in fourth place in the third race on Sunday morning.His eventual third place left him overall winner and as he said afterwards: ldquoIt was a beautul setting and some very hard racing, good mental preparation for the XC season coming up. How prophetic that was.To further emphasise his versatility, he ran the Amsterdam Half Marathon on October  and came home in ninth place, posting a superb .. which would have placed him fourth in the recent Belfast Half and sixth in the Waterside Half in Derry, so, he is a top quality runner over all terrains.Juniors at CookstownLauren Madine was the only female from the club juniors to take part in and duly won the U- girlsrsquo race at the Cookstown venue and ever-dependable Mackenzie Murray was the only boy from the club in the U- boysrsquo race, and while he found the going tough, hersquos learning by the week and I am confident that hersquoll develop into a top class runnerFirst points for ladiesEast Down ladies were much better represented than the men as they fielded a team of six and were more than pleased to place fth overall and to register their first place points of the current league campaign.The team scorers were Catherine OrsquoConnor , Niamh Kellett , Deirdre Weatheralland Clare Carsongiving a total of  points. Asto emphasise the importance of overtaking everyone possible, right to the very end, that total was matched by Acorns AC, but because their fourth scorer had finished higher than the East Down fourth-paced runner, Acorns get the better team position.In truth, the third-placed team had only six points less than either Acorns or EDAC, so with a few extra places it could so easily have been third place.

We just set about formalising a programme in earnest back in .ldquoOur programme works so well it is held up as a model for other schools across Northern Ireland to learn from and to embed its principles into their schools.Mr Moore says there is a fundamental dference between shared education and integration.ldquoThe main dference is that each school can hold on to their faith and culture but still be able to reach out in other aspects of the curriculum.ldquoOur parent teacher associations, for example, have been working together for some time. And on other levels we pull our resources too.Mr Moorersquos views were echoed by Mr Paul Coulter, his counterpart at St Patrickrsquos, who said the idea for shared education came from parents at both schools.Mr Coulter said that demand had grown over the years and that the schools were pulling their resources to fund shared experiences, such as educational trips.ldquoWhen you talk to the children you will see that they are really excited about coming together. Many strong friendships have been formed.Mrs Helen McEvoy, Shared Education co-ordinator at St Patrickrsquos, says the programme has given children the opportunity to come together and take part in learning together.She added: ldquoThe vision for the programme is to enhance the learning of all pupils in an environment where there is equal opportunity, good relations and mutual respect fostered, while at the same time acknowledging dferences and celebrating them.The Recorder met children from both schools last Thursday morning when they busy designing a new logo for their Shared Education Programme.Ten year-old Mya McCurry, who attends St Patrickrsquos Primary School, said she wasnrsquot able to see any dferences between pupils and teachers at both schools.ldquoWe started doing this programme when I was in P, she remarked. ldquoI am in P now. Itrsquos really fun and I look forward to having my friends from Ballynahinch Primary School coming here or visiting them at their school.ldquoTo be honest we were friends before we began getting together in school. I would have played with them on our street sometimes. Now we get together in school too and its terric fun.Leon Rose, a P pupil at Ballynahinch Primary School, revealed that taking part in the Shared Education Programme has helped him become less shy.He said: ldquoI enjoy it a lot and we maintain the friendships we make outside of school too.Also taking part in the programme is Patrick Pillitteri, a P pupil at St Patrickrsquos. Eager to reveal the best thing about shared education he said it was the trips they got to go on.He added: ldquoMy favourite trip was to the Kingspan Stadium at Ravenhill. Irsquom not big into rugby but this was something . It was a fabulous big stadium and it holds many thousands.ldquoIrsquom more of a soccer fan myself. I love Liverpool and I donrsquot ever see that changing any time soon. By the way, Liverpool beat Burnley - last night. That may not seem important to you, but it sure is to me.It came as no surprise then to learn that Patrick wants to be a Premier League footballer when he grows up.He said: ldquoIrsquom going to play for Liverpool when Irsquom older. I get lots of practice in with my friends from Ballynahinch Primary. Finlay and Leon are my best friends in this programme.Animal lover Becky Martin is in P at Ballynahinch Primary. She said the best thing about being part of the programme was organising and planing activities together.ldquoWe have been to Castleward, W and, as Patrick has said, we went to the Kingspan Stadium. There have been loads of trips.ldquoI love organising events. Together we agree on what we would like to do and see it through to the end.When asked what she hoped to do when she grew up, she said: ldquoI love animals but being a vet would make me sad. I would have to put animals to sleep and I wouldnrsquot like that. I think I would like to be a professional dog walker or groom dogs and cats when Irsquom older.Becky added: ldquoThe boys and girls from St Patrickrsquos Primary School bring lots of energy with them.

However, we can now look forward to  with a new senior football team management in place, but with no guarantees of success, his report states.ldquoWe have to believe, though, that indeed the corner will be turned and as we look back to  years without inter-county senior success in football, there is surely a catalyst there for players to say they are going to make it happen.Mr McAteer points out that it will take a concerted effort from all involved in the game to get Down challenging for honours again.ldquoIt must come from within us all, players must want to make it happen in their efforts in training and on match days.ldquoAdministrators have to make sure that the environment is right for Down teams to be successful. If both of those two forces can come together then I do believe that we can be successful again.The county secretary believes that the project to develop a county training facility at Ballykinlar is another initiative to be positive about and he hopes that planning permission can be achieved in .ldquoThe hopes of many will take a further step forward early in  as we move to appoint a planning consultant and a design team for our centre at Ballykinlar, he says.ldquoThe past year has been spent being careful to ensure that all of the right steps were being taken hopefully to obtain full planning permission by the end of .While Mr McAteer praises written media within the county and thanks them for their excellent coverage of Gaelic games, he reserves some criticism for TV coverage.He says he is concerned by the coverage provided by the BBC and UTV.ldquoThere is an imbalance and this imbalance gives scant recognition of the fact that Gaelic Games are the best attended sporting events in the North of Ireland and also have now the greatest levels of participation by male and female participants.ldquoI do not wish this issue to become a political football whereby MLAs try to outscore each other on the back of an imbalance. I would prefer that this matter was championed by Ulster GAA and the GAA nationally to improve the coverage of our games. We need at the very least, parity in terms of live and deferred TV coverage by BBC in particular and a better recognition of our games by UTV.Mr McAteer also pulls no punches when he covers some of the more controversial moments of .ldquoThere were good things happened in Down GAA in , occasions when we hung out our brightest colours and showed how can deliver to the highest standard.ldquoThere were other occasions when mediocrity was the norm and we became very good at mediocracy and then there was the ugly when we showed the country our poor and unacceptable side.ldquoYes, for Down GAA it was a year of mixed feelings and mixed emotions, pride and shame shared equal space in  in the world of Down GAA.ldquoThe eyes of the country and indeedwe take social media into account, the eyes of the world were focused upon us when images from one of our fixtures went viral and everyone was shocked by what they saw. The images represented all that should not be about the GAA.ldquoPhysical violence has no place in our games or indeed at any level in our association. The fact that they might take place within the confines of GAA property is not excuse for acceptance of and turning a blind eye to such incidents.ldquoIf these incidents were happening on a public street after a Saturday night out they would be deemed to be assault and grievous bodily harm. They would lead to prosecutions and possible sentencing all of which can have a huge impact on the le of the victim and the transgressor. Someone will get badly hurt in some of these incidentsthey are to continue at our grounds.Mr McAteer adds: The one punch message has been part of a campaign by the GAA and the authorities in recent times and it is a very real message. Facts are that one punch could kill and that is in honesty something none of us would ever dare to dream of happening at a GAA game, but reality is that it could.

She was told that Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council was considering a proposal to rationalise car parking in the town, and that the council had been renting a car park from Terrace Row Church for a number of years. Part of the rationalisation programme involved considering the termination of this lease.At a committee meeting which took place on  September  Councillor Duddy, a former mayor of Coleraine, declared his interest in respect of the item relating to the church. He then left the room, in compliance with the Code. However, immediately prior to the meeting and at the pre-group party meeting he had asked another councillor to raise issues and ask questions relating to the car park lease.The Commissioner found the action of asking another councillor to ask questions ‘on his behalf’ was a deliberate attempt to circumvent the rules on disclosure and declaration of interest and represented a serious breach of the Code.At a full council meeting on  September, Councillor Duddy did not declare an interest in the church, yet commented on the council’s plans and voted in favour of a proposal to try and extend the car park’s lease. This was in breach of paragraphs . and . of the Code. Although the motion was defeated, Ms Anderson noted that there would have been a signicant financial benefit to the churchit had been agreed.Having refused to attend a second interview with investigators, and not co-operated fully with the investigations into his actions, the Commissioner also found there had been a breach of rule . of the Code.With the Commissioner’s permission, the Deputy Commissioner withdrew allegations of Councillor Duddy’s failure to register his interest in the church.The Commissioner noted the previous good conduct of Councillor Duddy and exemplary public service record, as well as his willingness to learn from the events. However, she stated that these were outweighed by the deliberate nature of the breaches. Given the requirement to uphold public confidence in the conduct of local councillors, and the importance of discouraging similar conduct by others, she believed that a  month suspension was a proportionate sanction.It’s understood Cllr Duddy can appeal to the High Court against the Commissioner’s decision, in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act.The News Letter contacted Cllr Duddy, but he said he wasn’t able to make any comment at this time.QC: Jonathan Bell sacriced political career over RHI and is now a social worker Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingPSNI issue warning to O customers seeking refund after network outageN.I. to see snow before Christmas - gale-force winds and heavy rain arriving this weekendO compensation package revealedNI farmer killed by bull: Health and Safety Executive investigatingIN PICTURES: Funeral of murder victim Jim Donegan          ..

If nothing , we can learn from her doggedness, her devotion to her church , her politeness to interviewers, who too often have to deal with bolshie male politicians and, though I can’t believe I’m writing this, her putdown of the DUP, whose narrow mindedness grows by the day. I can’t see Mrs May going on any holiday she hadn’t paid fully for herself.When the Brexit shenanigans get too much for me, I take the dog for an extra walk or catch up with the Christmas decorating. In fact, it’s not going so well, because the tree, bought in the local garden centre, was left outside until we were ready for it and got such a soaking in the rain it had to go into the shed to dry off. Prime Minister Theresa May pictured at the Waterfront in BelfastMy suggestion to Himself that he dry it off with the hairdryer as I was too busy writing this column was greeted with a look that would leave a reindeer wimpering. Politically, I felt everything was going wrong when my colleague Ben Lowry, the News Letter’s deputy editor and political writer, wrote in last Saturday’s paper that: “The very fact that a Tory government propped up by an NI unionist party has been prepared to compromise sovereignty to placate Dublin is a bad harbinger, eventhis Withdrawal Agreement fails.”This tells us that Northern Ireland politicians aren’t that smart when they can be easily outwitted by our political hierarchy. They have learned nothing from our history when Winston Churchill was prepared to do some sort of dodgy deal with the southern Irish during the Second World War in order to get their permission to allow British warships use of their ports. So much for the Belfast Agreement signed a mere two decades ago. Sinn Fein, of course, have been lying low since the RHI scandal blew over us like a bad easterly wind, and despite the fact they have some issues to answer there too, they’re still trying to play it cool as the RHI inquiry takes up less newspaper space. They leave all the shouting to Mary Lou McDonald, their president, who has urged the Irish government to commit to holding a border pollthe UK crashes out of the European Union without a deal. Abortion is not simply a women’s rights issue Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"She insists she will be telling Mrs May that a referendum on Irish unity would “advance very quickly”, in the event of Britain crashing out of the EU. She can wish all she likes. I still have some faith in Theresa May and I can’t imagine she will have SF’s wish list top of her agenda. One surprising supporter of the Prime Minister is independent MP, Lady Sylvia Hermon, who, writing in this newspaper at the weekend, said that while the Prime Minister’s Brexit is not perfect, “I will vote to support her efforts to achieve the best deal for the whole of the United Kingdom, one which protects jobs in NI, and also protects Northern Ireland’s constitutional status, and the consent principle as guaranteed by the Belfast Agreement”.She also declared she was not prepared to risk PM Corbyn. Female pragmatism at its best. We can see what happens to high ranking politicians when they become too big for their boots and we have loads of them. This week has seen France’s President Emmanuel Macron eat much humble pie in his efforts to calm a people’s revolt of his own making. A month of ‘yellow vest rioting’ forced him into a climb down that should be a lesson to politicians everywhere. When it comes to real politics, the DUP have a lot to learn.Waste not, want not: festive fashion can be done on a budgetThis Christmas, I have watched the television programmes dealing with how the poor will fare over the festive period. Some of their stories have been heart breaking other less so when it is drugs and drinking which have led to their downfall. My generation learned to save for the rainy day as well as Christmas, a habit which has never left me. And still my Christmas budget got blown in no time at all despite my best efforts.An Oxfam survey has revealed that people in Northern Ireland will spend nearly £ on festive clothes this Christmas, throw away  items of clothing a year, and have  garments that have not been worn for  months. Almost half of them won’t be seen wearing last year’s Christmas party outfit this year. When I moved house last year, I resolved to clear out my wardrobe and I honestly tried my best. But that thrt thing in me kept raising its head and I moved house carrying most of what I should have binned. Oxfam claims that celebrities such as Kate Moss, Una Healy and Ellie Goulding have donated party wear this year to the charity. I know women who get the most fabulous clothes in charity shops. But would I wear last year’s Christmas outfit this festive season  The answer is ‘yes’ because my festive jumper is four years old. Festooned with fluffy, snowy robins, it wouldn’t be Christmas without it.try catch  TrendingPSNI issue warning to O customers seeking refund after network outageN.I. to see snow before Christmas - gale-force winds and heavy rain arriving this weekendO compensation package revealedNI farmer killed by bull: Health and Safety Executive investigatingIN PICTURES: Funeral of murder victim Jim Donegan          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was embroidered inside to read: ‘Made exclusively for Dr Jonathan Rea MBE’.The former Ballynure Primary School and Larne Grammar pupil said: “I’ve been back a few times to assemblies and to talk to the kids.

Jonathan Reas specially made suit for the ceremony“My grades at GCSE were A*s, As and Bs, but unfortunately I didn’t further that. I went travelling the world racing bikes.“After I left school I went to technical college and got an HNC in manufacturing engineering and then went on to work as an engineer.“It was hard to hold down a job as I was taking too much time off work to go racing.“I had what was nearly a career-ending injury. That was a dark time in my le because I didn’t know what was coming, I’d no great qualications behind me, I was working a minimum wage job. I wasn’t in a great state of mind.“I threw myself at bikes for a few years and then it worked out, my big break came.”He added: “Northern Ireland fans are very important to me. The travelling support has been immense these last few years. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.“On my sighting laps and slow down laps I can see the Northern Ireland fans. I always try to throw out a leg to acknowledge I’ve seen them.”Rea is often claimed by both Larne and Ballyclare and sometimes referred to as a son of Ballymena. Asked where he came from, he said: “I’m a country boy. I grew up in Kilwaughter, then moved to Ballyboley. We were part of Larne Council with a Ballymena area code and a Ballyclare postcode. I’m happy to be claimed by whoever.”try catch  TrendingHeartbreak as teenage Syrian refugee dies suddenlyHome turns into a Festive WonderlandStaff flee shop after activating panic alarmSchoolgirl injured in lsquohit and runrsquo incidentGot drunk as he was going through dficulties with we          ..

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety.

Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
