Above she is pictured during the 2015 White House Christmas Party          She made copious notes on the details of her personal life while traveling to more than 60 countries over five years on Air Force One, and witnessing Obama\u0027s life in midair. Above the president is pictured on the aircraft in 2009 Her new job would give her insight into the obscure party culture within the press pool, a glimpse of the president\u0027s personal life, and would even land her in a love affair with a White House staffer. She worked out on a treadmill next to the president, who often \u0027trash-talked\u0027 her, goaded her to run faster, and taught her to be optimistic. Beck saw how Obama coped with stress and grief over 60 foreign trips, cracked his Nicorette gum to keep from smoking, and on one occasion told stories about how he met Michelle and how she tried to pass him off to one of her friends.Around the world, she watched a crew of smokers douse themselves in Purell sanitizer up past their wrists after grabbing a smoke so there was no lingering smell of cigarettes for Obama who had quit the habit. \u0027No one deserves to be this lucky\u0027, the author writes about this core group of staffers who flew around the world on Air Force One together.Beck knew she wasn\u0027t a good fit for a job at a Washington think tank, PR firm, or nonprofit after her semester-long tutoring job at Sidwell Friends School - \u0027the Harvard of Washington\u0027s private schools\u0027 - ended in 2011.          Beck Dorey-Stein discusses her professional and private affairs while working as Obama\u0027s stenographer in From the Corner of the Oval The selective Quaker school in Washington has educated a lengthy roster of notable alumni from Teddy Roosevelt\u0027s son, Richard Nixon\u0027s daughter,  Al Gore\u0027s son, Chelsea Clinton, and the Obama girls, Malia and Sasha, as well as the children of members of Congress.Beck intended to only live in D.C. for the duration of the job – three months...\u0027because who wants to live in DC? – A one trick political pony town,\u0027 she writes. \u0027My job in the spring of 2011 was to help those hormonally-charged stressballs chill the f**k out\u0027, Beck writes while casting an eye to what looked like \u0027human Ken dolls in a short-sleeved button-down\u0027.Sitting across from one of them at the school one day flirting and thinking he was a teacher, the man told her he was working although he did not seem to be doing anything.He was a Secret Service agent watching Malia.In her new job assignment, Beck was advised by the hiring agency to stay away from the Secret Service agents as well as \u0027stay with your boyfriend\u0027.    She knew this was going to be her big break and felt confident leaving her boyfriend, Sam, back in Washington working for a PR firm writing speeches for gubernatorial candidates.He always encouraged her and supported her taking the job that would separate them.But Beck broke protocol of the job when she got involved in a hot and heavy secret sexual relationship with one of Obama\u0027s senior staffers in hotel rooms - and fell in love. Left with a broken heart and feeling duplicitous with too many nights at a bar getting drunk, she says the stolen thrill was worth the heartache although it cost her the relationship with her boyfriend in D.C.    Boarding Air Force One for the first time with an overstuffed duffel because she didn\u0027t know what not to pack, she thought she saw actor Jim Carrey sitting near the front of the plane.He turned out to be the man she fell hopelessly in love with, Jason Wolf - the man she left her hotel room door ajar for in foreign cities.Air Force One - where pool reporters had their own press cabin - has everything one could ask for in comfort – endless entrees, snacks, cocktails – except while on the luxury airliner, everyone paid for food and drinks.Rushing to unpack the first time in search of her steno gear and dumping out her computer bags on the seat next to her, out fell what looked like a vibrator – while one of Obama\u0027s traveling aides was standing there.          Beck\u0027s job was to record everything the president (pictured in 2008)  said, type it up, and release the transcript to the press office and presidential archive          Her new job would give her insight into the obscure party culture within the press pool, a glimpse of the president\u0027s personal life, and would even land her in a love affair with a White House stafferRed-faced, he hurried away.It was only a little travel-sized hot pink silk bag that resembled a vibrator – she wanted to tell him but didn\u0027t.Obama\u0027s traveling staff was almost all women and dubbed \u0027the Vagiants\u0027.This wasn\u0027t the case when he first took office in 2009 when there were few female senior staffers. Now it was the choice of the women to give themselves that name.\u0027Prudish? I would especially love it if the men in the West Wing nicknamed themselves the 10-Inch Senior Staffs\u0027, she writes.Beck was one of three stenographers rotating on the travel schedule.On international trips, media chipped in and chartered a private plane dubbed the \u0027party plane.\u0027Neither POTUS or senior White House staff traveled on it and the president stayed at a different hotel.The press charter arrived a day ahead of POTUS and Air Force One so TV networks could set up their live shots.On her first trip out, Beck found herself in $500-a night hotel rooms with breathtaking views of Cabo San Lucas before continuing on to Costa Rica, Tanzania, Laos. She\u0027d listen to old-timer boozy party animals tell stories about the different administrations, presidents, international incidents they\u0027ve witnessed – from George H.W. puking on the prime minister of Japan, Reagan in Rome falling asleep in front of the pope, Monica Lewinsky, 911, and Katrina.\u0027Pinch me because how is this scene my real life\u0027? Beck writes.Her first overseas trips on Air Force One took her to Thailand, Myanmar, and Cambodia where Obama requested an unscheduled stop at the Shwedagon Pagoda, the oldest Buddhist stupa in the world.          Beck admits she had a fling with a White House staffer Jason Wolf, who broke her heart           She recalls how the everyone in the press cabin took their drug of choice and how she\u0027d listen to old-timer boozy party animals tell stories about the different administrations, presidents, and international incidents they\u0027ve witnessedLooking out of the plane\u0027s window while flying into Myanmar, Obama saw the glare of the 451 diamonds encrusting the top of the Buddha and requested a stop.Traveling on to Cambodia, Beck walked out with the press and left recording equipment attached in the room where the president had met with the Japanese prime minister.This could have been interpreted as a spy tactic with a recorder still running. But any disaster was avoided by Wolf, who quickly removed the equipment.  Wolf never talked about his serious relationship with his girlfriend Brooke back home in LA whose father was a famous producer.Beck would leave her hotel room door open for him so he could sneak in at night.   They carried on across the globe while Beck tried to keep her boyfriend Sam out of her mind.She describes experiencing \u0027the best sleepover party ever\u0027 where everyone took their drug of choice on long flights – Sonata, Xanax or Ambien – which made any \u0027awkward intimacy with colleagues suddenly just funny and bizarre,\u0027 she writes. Heading for Delhi in India where the president met the prime minister, Beck was warned about the destitution, the starving children in the streets, begging mothers, sick and thin dogs lying around waiting for death and piles of trash everywhere.But no one on this trip saw any of that.          Beck saw how Obama coped with stress and grief over 60 foreign trips, cracked his Nicorette gum to keep from smoking, and on one occasion told stories about how he met First Lady MichelleThey were always protected from seeing the poverty in these countries and instead saw a \u0027glossy, two-dimensional Disney World version\u0027 while motorcading manicured streets.\u0027We do not see the slums or hear the screams. No matter where we are in the world, Dar es Salaam or Indianapolis, the field always looks the same: red carpet, white tent, blue velvet drape\u0027.Through a ten-day swing through Africa – Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania where they were advised not to drink the water, the physical risks didn\u0027t compare to the emotional ones, according to the author.\u0027Nothing is scary when the Secret Service is around you\u0027, Beck writes, but she became ill in South Africa after ingesting water on a lettuce leaf. In Jamaica, Obama visited the one-time home of reggae master Bob Marley and sang Marley\u0027s hit, \u0027Three Little Birds in his bedroom – and then on to Panama.The crew traveled with him for the First Family Christmas vacation in Hawaii and for his summer vacation on Martha\u0027s Vineyard.Obama left the Vineyard to deal with ISIS on the rise in the Middle East, Putin revving his power in Eastern Europe and the outbreak of Ebola in Africa – before returning to the Vineyard when the news broke that ISIS had beheaded photojournalist Jim Foley.POTUS made his televised statement the following morning after allowing the family to grieve.\u0027No one in that room can deny the power and sincerity of the president\u0027s address. But even more remarkable than the president\u0027s palpable anger – the sound that follows his words: unprecedented silence\u0027.          While traveling, they were always protected from seeing the poverty in third-world countries and instead saw a \u0027glossy, two-dimensional Disney World version\u0027 while motorcading manicured streets The press were allowed no questions.\u0027And then the president goes golfing\u0027, Beck writes.Negative news stories condemned Obama\u0027s decision to play golf in the wake of such a tragedy but \u0027that exercise is how POTUS copes with stress and grief\u0027, the author writes.\u0027Golf doesn\u0027t provide the president an escape it allows him the only breathing room he\u0027s afforded\u0027.He can\u0027t just go for a walk and hasn\u0027t run outside since 2007.\u0027His influence circles the globe, but his physical freedom is limited to eighteen holes\u0027.\u0027It\u0027s lonely at the top\u0027.CNN pays homage to Bourdain with tribute show that includes...Dennis Rodman CRIES live on CNN as he reveals how Obama...Share this articleWith the end of Obama\u0027s term in sight, Beck wanted to be outside the HRC bubble and away from what felt like power players in Washington hungry to prove something.It was hard for her to imagine not traveling together with this crew of colleagues she had circled the globe with in Air Force One.She remembered the words of Von, the White House butler on her first day who had told her: \u0027It\u0027s just a job.\u0027 \u0027We are nothing special, just lucky,\u0027 she writes.  It was a privilege, an honor, and a job.Her affair with Jason was over and he went back to LA and married his girlfriend.Sam, her old boyfriend, was long gone and back in the arms of his first girlfriend.The author stayed on with the Trump administration –  or what she describes as the \u0027insane clown posse\u0027 – and the White House executive parking lot now filled with Porsches and Maseratis\u0027s instead of Priuses and Chevys.What was once joy has become \u0027a waking nightmare. I\u0027m now a stenographer in the Trump administration\u0027.From the Corner of the Oval will be released on July 10, 2018 and is available for pre-order on Amazon.   From the Corner of the Oval: A Memoir: Beck Dorey-Stein: 9780525509127: Amazon.com: Books"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/13/13/4D2AA8E300000578-5837027-image-a-29_1528894461773.jpg","title":"Studio portraits African Americans 1940s 1950s display Met","story":"    The Metropolitan Museum of Art will exhibit more than 150 studio portraits of African Americans from the 1940s and \u002750s, starting on June 26 through October 8          Though many of the subjects and photographers are unidentified, each portrait tells a story through the clothes and body language, such as this couple in a loving embrace, photographed in 1943          The collection of portraits offers a rare glimpse into what life was like for African Americans during World War II and beyond Though most of the subjects in the portraits are unidentified, they tell their own stories through their affectionate embraces, military uniforms and graduation caps and gowns. Of the photographers and studios themselves, little is known. Mr Rosenheim says many of the portraits were sourced from the South in particular, but little else is known about them.Many studios at the time were small and didn\u0027t last long, but at least one studio, the Daisy Studio in Memphis, Tennessee was more established and has been identified in a number of the portraits by a small plaque in the bottom corners of the portraits.The full horror of fighting in the trenches revealed:...Early landscape painting by Vincent Van Gogh of women...Share this articleDuring wartime, photographic studios became a popular place for communities to gather, but particularly during World War II, American culture was shifting \u0027seismically\u0027, Mr Rosenheim says.   The Great Depression had ended and more money was in circulation, so people could treat themselves to portraits – which they hadn\u0027t been able to as much before – and the middle class grew. It also helps that the process of taking portraits was less easier and less expensive than it had been before, according to The Met.\u0027Using waterproof direct positive paper rather than film, the studios were able to offer their clientele high quality, inexpensive portraits in a matter of minutes,\u0027 a statement says.          Though little is known about many of the studios, at least one, the Daisy Studio in Memphis, Tennessee has been identified in a number of portraits by a small  plaque in the bottom corners of the portraits like this portrait from 1942          It was during wartime that photographic studios became a popular place for communities to gather, as the middle class grew and the culture was shifting          The Met press release says: \u0027Using waterproof direct positive paper rather than film, the studios were able to offer their clientele high quality, inexpensive portraits in a matter of minutes\u0027Mr Rosenheim says: \u0027I started seeing these pictures and I realized they had poignancy and were entrancing and simple and many soldiers and sailors and airmen and women posing in their uniforms… and the way they look at the camera and the way their sisters and children and mothers look at the camera and the way friends pose with each other and look at the camera, is just particularly special. \u0027Because it was a time of great change in the US and it was on the cusp of the Civil Rights era. It was the beginning of the second great migration from the South. And it was also a time of introspection.\u0027He adds: \u0027The show is kind of inspired by Frederick Douglass, who argued, at the time of slavery, that even after slavery ended, which he hoped would be soon, that he did not think African Americans would be fully free until they could imagine themselves and project themselves using photography as an act of self-expression. And to replace the negative images of African Americans with positive ones. And that\u0027s what I see in these pictures as an inspiration.\u0027          \u0027The poignancy of these small photographs lies in the essential respect the camera offers its subjects, who sit for their portraits as an act of self-expression,\u0027 the release says          Though some of the backdrops were plain, many portraits were taken in front of elaborate painted backgrounds of forests, lakes and flowers, like this one          This portrait from 1945 shows a woman posing in front of a painted backdrop of a lake, with mountains and flowers  Though few of the subjects have been identified beyond a possible first name or personal note written on the back, Mr Rosenheim hopes that the opening of the exhibit will help curators be able to identify as many of the subjects and portrait studios as they can.\u0027I’m hoping that… people coming to see the show will recognize family members or distant friends or say, doesn’t this look like so and so? Haven’t I seen this face before? I really hope that people will contact us,\u0027 he says.\u0027Mathematically, the youngest people that went to fight in World War II are dying or have just recently died… People who lived a long time. These are people who lived until their 80s or 90s. And so we’re on the cusp of no one knowing who these people are. It’s a really interesting moment.\u0027 The exhibit, with more than 150 studio portraits, will open at The Met Fifth Avenue on June 26 and will be open until October 8.\u0027African American Portraits: Photographs from the 1940s and 1950s\u0027 is organized by Mr Rosenheim and was put on with the help of the Alfred Stieglitz Society.

In a grovelling apology, he said: ‘It is extraordinarily disappointing and I am extremely sorry and I am unhappy we let ... our customers down.’ The scandal comes after Carphone Warehouse, now owned by Dixons Carphone, was fined £400,000 by the ICO in January following a hack hitting more than three million customers in 2015.For the past 11 months, hackers have been able to access personal data, including addresses and phone numbers. Dixons said the hack occurred in one of the processing systems of Currys PC World and Dixons Travel stores.          The breach included details of 5.9 million payment cards and 1.2 million personal data records Simon McCalla, of Nominet, which is responsible for the security of UK domain names, said the timing of the breach is all the worse considering the recently brought in rules on data protection.He said:  \u0027It\u0027s also alarming to see how long it took the company to respond to the breach, which allegedly began in July last year. \u0027As we\u0027re now nearly a year on, something clearly went wrong. With GDPR now in place, businesses need to tighten up their processes and ensure they have a plan in place to prevent these breaches, or risk paying a huge penalty.\u0027The company doesn\u0027t believe any customer data left its systems, but at this stage they can\u0027t be sure, especially as over 100,000 non-EU cards have been compromised.\u0027 The Information Commissioner\u0027s Office is investigating and urged anyone who feared they were a victim of fraud to follow the advice of Action Fraud. It is understood the breach took place before new rules on data protection were introduced in May, meaning the company would not have had to notify authorities within 72 hours.          Hackers have repeatedly targeted British companies to access customers\u0027 dataIt emerged last year that around 400,000 people in the UK may have had their information stolen following a cybersecurity breach at the credit monitoring firm Equifax.The US company said an investigation had revealed that a file containing UK consumer information \u0027may potentially have been accessed\u0027.The data included names, dates of birth, email addresses and telephone numbers, but not not addresses, passwords or financial information, the company said.In 2016, TalkTalk was hit with a record £400,000 fine for the security failings that led to the company being hacked in October 2015.The Information Commissioner\u0027s Office said the attack \u0027could have been prevented if TalkTalk had taken basic steps to protect customers\u0027 information\u0027.More than 150,000 people of the internet service provider had personal information access, including sensitive financial data of more than 15,000 customers.

In 1998, Kark returned to Australia and worked for Ten News in Brisbane.Two years later he moved to the Nine Network and started out as a reporter and back-up presenter for National Nine News. After covering the Warragamba bushfires, he was given a role to Nine’s Sydney newsroom.Stefanovic went on to replace Today host Steve Liebmann in 2005 and still presents the show to this day. Karl has also filled in on A Current Affair and participated on Torvill and Dean’s Dancing on Ice. He also worked on Carols by Candlelight and is a reporter on 60 Minutes.He met Cassandra Thorburn in 1995 and they later married, having three children together before separating after 21 years. Their orce was finalised in October 2017.          Stefanovic went on to replace Steve Liebmann in 2005 and still presents Today to this dayKarl Stefanovic and Jasmine YarbroughAfter meeting on a Sydney Harbour boat cruise in December 2016, Karl Stefanovic and Jasmine Yarbrough were seen kissing the following February and their romance was confirmed. A year later, the pair were engaged despite claiming to take things slowly.\u0027We are taking things really, really slowly. I certainly did not expect to meet someone five months after I broke up with my wife. That was not planned. I met her on a boat in Sydney. We have a really lovely relationship, but it\u0027s got to be slow for a variety of reasons,\u0027 Karl said.They made their first appearance at the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week and spent time together in Bora Bora and Mexico, where Karl met Jasmine’s parents for the first time. However, many slammed Karl’s quick move from Cassandra to Jasmine, including former KIIS FM radio host Meshel Laurie.The radio host blasted their displays of affection as ‘insensitive’ and ‘shameless’. \u0027It feels a little insensitive, obviously I don\u0027t know these people. Is it criminal? No. Is it illegal? No, is it a bit bloody shameless and rotten? Maybe.’           Cassandra Thorburn and Karl Stefanovic attend the Global Illumination Gala Dinner 2008In the marriage that lasted over 21 years, Cassandra seemed to act as the traditional mother and wife and would ‘struggle to re-establish her career, following two decades of standing loyally by her husband’s side as a somewhat “traditional wife and mother”.’After their separation, it was rumoured that Stefanovic had agreed to a ‘orce financialproperty settlement’ and from the deal, Karl received $500,000 (£284,000) out of the couple’s combined net worth of $6.5 million (£3.7m) as well as his Mercedes Benz car. Cassandra got the remaining $6 million (£3.4m), 92 per cent of the asset pool.Creek, a managing director and special counsel in orce law, believed that Cassandra is able to enter the workforce and earn the same as her ex-husband. ‘Perhaps Mr Stefanovic is shortly to inherit a large fortune.

We have a historic solution after two and a half decades. Our agreement includes Republic of North Macedonia for overall use,\u0027 Zaev (pictured) told reporters in the capital Skopje yesterday  Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras speaks during a televised address to the nation, in Athens, after Greece and Macedonia reached an agreement on Tuesday to end a bitter 27-year name dispute The deal reached by the prime ministers of the two countries is expected to be signed by their foreign ministers this weekend. After that, Macedonia\u0027s parliament would vote on it, and if it is approved, Ivanov\u0027s signature would be needed.If the president refuses to sign, the deal would return to parliament for another vote. Ivanov would have to sign off on the agreement if it is passed a second time.The name dispute, which has prevented Macedonia from joining international institutions such as NATO, has roused strong nationalist sentiments and poisoned the two countries\u0027 relations since the Balkan country declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.Greece argues that the term \u0027Macedonia\u0027 implies a claim on the territory and ancient heritage of its own northern province of the same name - the birthplace of ancient warrior king Alexander the Great.Macedonia agrees to change its name to end decades-long...The new migrant path to Europe: People smugglers open new...European leaders in talks to create migrant camp outside the...Ex Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith accuses EU of trying to...Share this articleEuropean Council President Donald Tusk and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg issued a statement Wednesday welcoming the deal, but added a note of warning.\u0027We hope that this unique opportunity to relaunch the wider Western Balkan region\u0027s European and Euro-Atlantic integration will not be wasted,\u0027 the statement said. \u0027This agreement sets an example for others on how to consolidate peace and stability across the region.\u0027The two prime ministers\u0027 efforts to forge an agreement face strong dissent, with opponents staging large protests on both sides of the border. The issue threatened to split Greece\u0027s governing coalition, and provoked a rift between Macedonia\u0027s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev and Ivanov.\u0027Everything that is sacred to Macedonia is being trampled underfoot, and the unborn are deprived of the right and pride to be Macedonians,\u0027 Ivanov said in his address.  Ancient Macedonia was the cradle of Alexander the Great\u0027s empire, a point of pride to Greeks today. Pictured: A statue of Alexander in Thessaloniki, GreeceCalls were circulating on Macedonian social media for a renewed street protest late Wednesday, while Greek opponents of the deal are planning a rally in Athens on Friday. Hardliners on both sides are arguing that their prime ministers conceded too much to reach the deal. In Macedonia, Zaev has said he will put the deal to a referendum in the fall.Zaev, accompanied by Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov, visited Ivanov Wednesday to brief him on the deal. But Ivanov refused to discuss the issue.\u0027President Ivanov ... left the meeting, refusing to talk about the achievements of this historical agreement,\u0027 the government said in a statement.\u0027I think Prime Minister Zaev\u0027s most difficult task will be to actually explain the deal, to build political consensus for the implementation and, of course, the upcoming referendum,\u0027 said political analyst Petar Arsovski.Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras also faces opposition at home.Defense Minister Panos Kammenos, whose right-wing Independent Greeks party is the coalition partner in Tsipras\u0027 government, said he would oppose an agreement in a parliamentary vote. This would leave the left-wing prime minister dependent on support from political opponents to ratify the deal in parliament.Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the head of New Democracy, Greece\u0027s main opposition party, described the agreement as \u0027deeply problematic\u0027 and called on Greece\u0027s president to intervene so the deal can be debated in parliament before it is signed, instead of after.On the streets of both capitals, reactions were mixed.\u0027We lost the country, this is a disaster,\u0027 45-year-old lawyer Mila Ivanovska said in Skopje, the Macedonian capital, and began to cry.Greek opponents were equally angry.\u0027You, Slavs from Skopje through the centuries, you have never been true Macedonians,\u0027 said Athenian resident Konstandinos Goutras.But for others, the deal marks a welcome end to a protracted dispute.\u0027North Macedonia is acceptable for me,\u0027 said Svetlana Jancevska, a 55-year-old music teacher in Skopje, adding that it will \u0027not damage my identity as Macedonian. The language remains Macedonian and that makes me happy. It was high time for the problem to be solved.\u0027The dispute was deadlocked for years but hope for a resolution was rekindled after Zaev became Macedonia\u0027s prime minister last year, replacing conservative Nikola Gruevski who had served as prime minister for a decade.Opponents in Greece object to any use of the term \u0027Macedonia\u0027 in their northern neighbor\u0027s name, fearing territorial claims and seeing the use of the name as a usurping of Greece\u0027s ancient heritage. Opponents in Macedonia disagree with any modification to their country\u0027s name, seeing it as a threat to their national identity.While both sides have announced certain details of the deal, the full text has not been made public yet.According to what has been released, the citizens of the newly named country will be called \u0027Macedoniancitizen of the Republic of North Macedonia.\u0027 The deal includes provisions for labels to be placed on statues erected in Macedonia depicting the likeness of Alexander the Great which make clear they refer to ancient Greek times.After it\u0027s ratified by Macedonia, Greece will then back invitations for Macedonia to join NATO and start negotiations on joining the EU. However, Tsipras said, this will be contingent on Macedonia completing the constitutional changes."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/13/21/4D32996A00000578-0-image-a-6_1528920792526.jpg","title":"Homes evacuated huge blaze scrapyard triggers explosions Welsh town","story":"Homes have been evacuated tonight as firefighters tackle a serious blaze at a scrapyard in Wales  Witnesses in Pontypridd say they are hearing \u0027explosions\u0027 as the fire is understood to have spread through the site\u0027s car park          Huge plumes of smoke could be seen from people\u0027s back gardens          The fire seen from the A470 towards Cardiff          Four fire engines are at the scene along with three water bowsers South Wales Fire and Rescue said: \u0027There\u0027s a building on fire and black smoke in the area.

It would also put Parliament in charge of the final stage of the negotiations. Minutes after Mr Grieve left yesterday’s meeting the participants started planning on a campaign for a second referendum to stop Brexit.Mr Rees-Mogg said it was ‘completely improper’ for the Commission to allow its buildings ‘to be used in a domestic political controversy’.‘We fund the EU and it should not use our money to interfere in our domestic affairs,’ he said.Sir Bill Cash, the chairman of the Commons European scrutiny committee, said: ‘It’s clear that Mr Grieve is consorting with those people who are all intent on reversing Brexit.‘It makes his claim that he is trying to be helpful to the Government transparent nonsense.’Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘I’m surprised if he is meeting with a whole load of people whose sole purpose is to stop Brexit when he has said it is not his intention to do so.’      Pictured (from left to right) Patience Wheatcroft, Ros Altmann and Sarah Ludford pictured in Smith Square yesterdayThe ex-editor‘We have to stop Brexit,’ is view of former newspaper editor Patience Wheatcroft, ennobled by David Cameron in 2010.

She urged MPs to tell Leave voters to ‘suck it up’ and accept that free movement would have to continue as part of any Brexit deal. ‘Suck it up, suck it up and accept there is no alternative other than the customs union and single market,’ she said. ‘Let’s grab it and move on.’Her comments sparked fury, with fellow Tory Simon Clarke warning they would be met with ‘disbelief’ by Leave voters in his Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland constituency. He told MPs: ‘My constituents voted to leave the EU precisely because they were not going to suck it up. They know what they voted for.‘If we break faith and ignore their voice we will create the most almighty problem for ourselves and have lost the chance to have a sensible debate around issues like immigration.’ Mrs May halted a major Tory rebellion on the EU Withdrawal Bill on Tuesday by agreeing to hold talks with rebel MPs on their demands.Government sources said the PM was willing to discuss the demand that MPs will get a guaranteed vote on Brexit, regardless of whether ministers succeed in striking a deal or not.But Mr Grieve and his supporters want the power to ‘direct’ the Government if talks fail – holding out the prospect that MPs could order ministers to stay in the single market or not even leave the EU at all. Mrs May yesterday said: ‘I cannot countenance Parliament being able to overturn the will of the British people. Parliament gave the decision to the British people, the British people voted to leave the European Union and, as Prime Minister, I am determined to deliver that.’Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, said rebels’ demands for a meaningful vote were ‘not about parliamentary scrutiny but about stopping Brexit’. Fellow Tory Philip Davies said those calling for a meaningful vote ‘would be betraying the result of the referendum’.Eurosceptic MP Daniel Kawczynski last night urged Leave voters to boot out Tory rebels trying to thwart Brexit.He added: ‘Some MPs still clearly don’t wish to respect the will of the British people.

Above the president is pictured on the aircraft in 2009 Her new job would give her insight into the obscure party culture within the press pool, a glimpse of the president\u0027s personal life, and would even land her in a love affair with a White House staffer. She worked out on a treadmill next to the president, who often \u0027trash-talked\u0027 her, goaded her to run faster, and taught her to be optimistic. Beck saw how Obama coped with stress and grief over 60 foreign trips, cracked his Nicorette gum to keep from smoking, and on one occasion told stories about how he met Michelle and how she tried to pass him off to one of her friends.Around the world, she watched a crew of smokers douse themselves in Purell sanitizer up past their wrists after grabbing a smoke so there was no lingering smell of cigarettes for Obama who had quit the habit. \u0027No one deserves to be this lucky\u0027, the author writes about this core group of staffers who flew around the world on Air Force One together.Beck knew she wasn\u0027t a good fit for a job at a Washington think tank, PR firm, or nonprofit after her semester-long tutoring job at Sidwell Friends School - \u0027the Harvard of Washington\u0027s private schools\u0027 - ended in 2011.

Beck\u0027s job was to record everything the president (pictured in 2008)  said, type it up, and release the transcript to the press office and presidential archive          Her new job would give her insight into the obscure party culture within the press pool, a glimpse of the president\u0027s personal life, and would even land her in a love affair with a White House stafferRed-faced, he hurried away.It was only a little travel-sized hot pink silk bag that resembled a vibrator – she wanted to tell him but didn\u0027t.Obama\u0027s traveling staff was almost all women and dubbed \u0027the Vagiants\u0027.This wasn\u0027t the case when he first took office in 2009 when there were few female senior staffers. Now it was the choice of the women to give themselves that name.\u0027Prudish? I would especially love it if the men in the West Wing nicknamed themselves the 10-Inch Senior Staffs\u0027, she writes.Beck was one of three stenographers rotating on the travel schedule.On international trips, media chipped in and chartered a private plane dubbed the \u0027party plane.\u0027Neither POTUS or senior White House staff traveled on it and the president stayed at a different hotel.The press charter arrived a day ahead of POTUS and Air Force One so TV networks could set up their live shots.On her first trip out, Beck found herself in $500-a night hotel rooms with breathtaking views of Cabo San Lucas before continuing on to Costa Rica, Tanzania, Laos. She\u0027d listen to old-timer boozy party animals tell stories about the different administrations, presidents, international incidents they\u0027ve witnessed – from George H.W. puking on the prime minister of Japan, Reagan in Rome falling asleep in front of the pope, Monica Lewinsky, 911, and Katrina.\u0027Pinch me because how is this scene my real life\u0027? Beck writes.Her first overseas trips on Air Force One took her to Thailand, Myanmar, and Cambodia where Obama requested an unscheduled stop at the Shwedagon Pagoda, the oldest Buddhist stupa in the world.          Beck admits she had a fling with a White House staffer Jason Wolf, who broke her heart           She recalls how the everyone in the press cabin took their drug of choice and how she\u0027d listen to old-timer boozy party animals tell stories about the different administrations, presidents, and international incidents they\u0027ve witnessedLooking out of the plane\u0027s window while flying into Myanmar, Obama saw the glare of the 451 diamonds encrusting the top of the Buddha and requested a stop.Traveling on to Cambodia, Beck walked out with the press and left recording equipment attached in the room where the president had met with the Japanese prime minister.This could have been interpreted as a spy tactic with a recorder still running. But any disaster was avoided by Wolf, who quickly removed the equipment.  Wolf never talked about his serious relationship with his girlfriend Brooke back home in LA whose father was a famous producer.Beck would leave her hotel room door open for him so he could sneak in at night.   They carried on across the globe while Beck tried to keep her boyfriend Sam out of her mind.She describes experiencing \u0027the best sleepover party ever\u0027 where everyone took their drug of choice on long flights – Sonata, Xanax or Ambien – which made any \u0027awkward intimacy with colleagues suddenly just funny and bizarre,\u0027 she writes. Heading for Delhi in India where the president met the prime minister, Beck was warned about the destitution, the starving children in the streets, begging mothers, sick and thin dogs lying around waiting for death and piles of trash everywhere.But no one on this trip saw any of that.          Beck saw how Obama coped with stress and grief over 60 foreign trips, cracked his Nicorette gum to keep from smoking, and on one occasion told stories about how he met First Lady MichelleThey were always protected from seeing the poverty in these countries and instead saw a \u0027glossy, two-dimensional Disney World version\u0027 while motorcading manicured streets.\u0027We do not see the slums or hear the screams. No matter where we are in the world, Dar es Salaam or Indianapolis, the field always looks the same: red carpet, white tent, blue velvet drape\u0027.Through a ten-day swing through Africa – Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania where they were advised not to drink the water, the physical risks didn\u0027t compare to the emotional ones, according to the author.\u0027Nothing is scary when the Secret Service is around you\u0027, Beck writes, but she became ill in South Africa after ingesting water on a lettuce leaf. In Jamaica, Obama visited the one-time home of reggae master Bob Marley and sang Marley\u0027s hit, \u0027Three Little Birds in his bedroom – and then on to Panama.The crew traveled with him for the First Family Christmas vacation in Hawaii and for his summer vacation on Martha\u0027s Vineyard.Obama left the Vineyard to deal with ISIS on the rise in the Middle East, Putin revving his power in Eastern Europe and the outbreak of Ebola in Africa – before returning to the Vineyard when the news broke that ISIS had beheaded photojournalist Jim Foley.POTUS made his televised statement the following morning after allowing the family to grieve.\u0027No one in that room can deny the power and sincerity of the president\u0027s address. But even more remarkable than the president\u0027s palpable anger – the sound that follows his words: unprecedented silence\u0027.          While traveling, they were always protected from seeing the poverty in third-world countries and instead saw a \u0027glossy, two-dimensional Disney World version\u0027 while motorcading manicured streets The press were allowed no questions.\u0027And then the president goes golfing\u0027, Beck writes.Negative news stories condemned Obama\u0027s decision to play golf in the wake of such a tragedy but \u0027that exercise is how POTUS copes with stress and grief\u0027, the author writes.\u0027Golf doesn\u0027t provide the president an escape it allows him the only breathing room he\u0027s afforded\u0027.He can\u0027t just go for a walk and hasn\u0027t run outside since 2007.\u0027His influence circles the globe, but his physical freedom is limited to eighteen holes\u0027.\u0027It\u0027s lonely at the top\u0027.CNN pays homage to Bourdain with tribute show that includes...Dennis Rodman CRIES live on CNN as he reveals how Obama...Share this articleWith the end of Obama\u0027s term in sight, Beck wanted to be outside the HRC bubble and away from what felt like power players in Washington hungry to prove something.It was hard for her to imagine not traveling together with this crew of colleagues she had circled the globe with in Air Force One.She remembered the words of Von, the White House butler on her first day who had told her: \u0027It\u0027s just a job.\u0027 \u0027We are nothing special, just lucky,\u0027 she writes.  It was a privilege, an honor, and a job.Her affair with Jason was over and he went back to LA and married his girlfriend.Sam, her old boyfriend, was long gone and back in the arms of his first girlfriend.The author stayed on with the Trump administration –  or what she describes as the \u0027insane clown posse\u0027 – and the White House executive parking lot now filled with Porsches and Maseratis\u0027s instead of Priuses and Chevys.What was once joy has become \u0027a waking nightmare.

It was ruled the boy can return home with his care supervised by social services.Analysing the 44-page witness statement from a Carmarthenshire county Council social worker, Mr Justice Mostyn described the evidence as \u0027very long on rhetoric\u0027 but \u0027very short\u0027 on examples of \u0027deficient\u0027 parenting.  Speaking at the Family Division of the High Court in London, Mr Justice Mostyn said it was \u0027very hard\u0027 to pin down what exactly the social services had \u0027against\u0027 the mother.He said: \u0027The local authority\u0027s evidence in opposition to the mother\u0027s application was contained in an extremely long, 44-page, witness statement made by the social worker.\u0027          The case was heard at the The Royal Courts of Justice todayHe added: \u0027This witness statement was very long on rhetoric and generalised criticism but very short indeed on any concrete examples of where and how the mother\u0027s parenting had been deficient.\u0027 The social worker had been asked to \u0027identify her best example\u0027 of the mother failing to meet the boys emotional needs - to which she replied citing that she had not given him ice cream. \u0027Her response was that until prompted by the local authority mother had not spent sufficient one-to-one time with (the boy) and had failed on one occasion to take him out for an ice cream,\u0027 said the judge.\u0027This struck me as utterly insubstantial criticism.\u0027He added: \u0027A further criticism in this vein was that the mother had failed to arrange for (his) hair to be cut in the way that he liked.

She has claimed in the Lords that ‘the public wants a vote on the final deal’ – a second referendum she hopes will delay Brexit – and has encouraged Remainers, saying ‘history is on your side’.Pensions queenA Tory peer since 2015 and a former pensions minister under David Cameron, Ros Altmann has repeatedly voted against the Government on key Brexit issues in the Lords.

Mr Grieve followed just before 10.45am. Shortly afterwards came Tom Baldwin, who was Labour ex-leader Ed Miliband’s spin doctor and now works for People’s Vote, and James McGrory, the former communications director at Stronger In, the official Remain campaign, who now works for Open Britain.Mr Grieve left just before midday. Most of the other participants left around 1pm, including Baroness Altmann, the anti-Brexit Tory peer, Patience Wheatcroft, the Tory peer and former newspaper editor who has backed a second referendum and has argued ‘we have to stop Brexit’, and the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman in the Lords, Sarah Ludford.They were joined by AC Grayling, the philosopher who has said it was wrong to ‘normalise acceptance of leaving the EU’.The meeting reveals that separate Remainer groups are coordinating to try to stop Britain’s departure from the EU. On Tuesday night Mr Grieve told the Commons he was not trying to prevent Brexit but ‘legitimately looking at the detail of one of the most complex legal and political exercises in which we have ever engaged in peacetime’.In an interview with The Guardian last month, he backed another national poll to ask the public ‘is this what you really want?’ but also claimed he was ‘not working to precipitate it’.

She urged MPs to tell Leave voters to ‘suck it up’ and accept that free movement would have to continue as part of any Brexit deal. ‘Suck it up, suck it up and accept there is no alternative other than the customs union and single market,’ she said. ‘Let’s grab it and move on.’Her comments sparked fury, with fellow Tory Simon Clarke warning they would be met with ‘disbelief’ by Leave voters in his Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland constituency. He told MPs: ‘My constituents voted to leave the EU precisely because they were not going to suck it up. They know what they voted for.‘If we break faith and ignore their voice we will create the most almighty problem for ourselves and have lost the chance to have a sensible debate around issues like immigration.’ Mrs May halted a major Tory rebellion on the EU Withdrawal Bill on Tuesday by agreeing to hold talks with rebel MPs on their demands.Government sources said the PM was willing to discuss the demand that MPs will get a guaranteed vote on Brexit, regardless of whether ministers succeed in striking a deal or not.But Mr Grieve and his supporters want the power to ‘direct’ the Government if talks fail – holding out the prospect that MPs could order ministers to stay in the single market or not even leave the EU at all.

Fellow Tory Philip Davies said those calling for a meaningful vote ‘would be betraying the result of the referendum’.Eurosceptic MP Daniel Kawczynski last night urged Leave voters to boot out Tory rebels trying to thwart Brexit.He added: ‘Some MPs still clearly don’t wish to respect the will of the British people.

An art class lasts an hour. The teacher spends 10 minutes explaining what the students have to do, then they spend the next 45 minutes doing it. And while they’re cutting out, drawing and colouring, the teacher just sits there at his desk. That repeats hourly, from 8am until 6pm, every single day.So about four years in, I started making work in the classroom. I first became obsessed with hyperrealistic drawing. My students were what I had in front of me, so I started taking passport-style photographs of them, which I would copy. Within a few months, people thought my drawings were photographs. I then moved on to colour photographs and oil painting, before realising that the photographs were what was most interesting. In the darkroom, I would notice things I hadn’t seen in the viewfinder. The student sitting behind the model, or the one holding the paper background and looking away. So I started integrating more students into the images. And since it was an art room, the materials I had to hand – paper, cloth, tape, plaster – made their way into the images, too. I’d plan out exactly what I wanted to do, and then do a few versions of each, with different pupils. Sometimes I’d need to bring objects in from the outside – a very large jumper, a woollen hat I had asked a seamstress friend to make, or a pair of trousers of which she had lengthened one leg.With this image, I started with the cardboard feet and gradually added cardboard arms. The boy couldn’t get the feet on without taking off his shoes, and I left his shoes exactly where he put them. They reminded me of my father, a very lazy man. When he comes home after work, he takes off his suit to put on his joggers, and leaves it right there on the floor. Running through these images, and my work in general, is this idea of Moroccan society being stuck, in limbo. A society that doesn’t move, yet isn’t stable one out of kilter. Sometimes the model would appear to be hanging from the ceiling, or he’d be seated at a desk tipping over to one side. Sometimes they’d be seated at desks on top of desks. Fifteen years on, Morocco has changed but not necessarily developed. You see people driving in the wrong direction on the motorway, or not stopping at red lights others throwing stuff out of windows donkeys weaving through traffic. There are laws, but everyone just does as they please. It is the world upside-down, a surreal place.If I was bored, the students were, too. I had to follow the curriculum in class, and it was so repetitive, so pointless, that anything out of the ordinary was exciting for them. As soon as I took my camera out, their faces would light up. “What’s he going to get us to do now?” I could feel their gaze on me: we had a real understanding. I didn’t direct them in terms of making facial expressions. I’d just set up the camera and tell them how to position themselves. It was only when I developed the film that I’d notice they were smiling, or looking serious.It didn’t make them any more interested in art. They really didn’t care. These sessions never led to any conversations. I would try to engage them further – talking about Matisse’s cutouts, say, his technique, his childlike sensibility – and they’d listen respectfully, but without curiosity. One day I gave copies of one photo to the two students who were in it, and they immediately put them in their notebooks and asked if they could leave. I scratched my head, wondering if they’d not realised it was them in the picture. I asked them what they thought. They said they didn’t think it was beautiful – because a good picture, for them, was a portrait with big smiles. I don’t remember any of their names – I saw about 460 students a week – but I’ve since met a couple who remember me. Once in Paris, I was waiting to cross the road and noticed a north African girl on the other side, staring at me. When we passed each other, she stopped to ask if I was Monsieur Benohoud. To which I replied: “Let’s get out of the road first.” We spoke for a while, and she said: “You were my teacher you took photos of me in that series.” She was an adult now, no longer a teenager.• Hicham Benohoud’s series The Classroom will be exhibited in the Carte Blanche show at PHotoESPAÑA 2018, in Madrid, until 26 August.Training: Art baccalauréat art teacher training at the Centre Pédagogique Régional, Marrakech, and the Centre de Formation de Plasticiens Intervenants Ecole des Arts Décoratifs, Strasbourg."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea932ecf922fdba53f668f44e24f80daa270b8b8/36_242_2574_1545/master/2574.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=382d99532745eb742978f0428f024aaf","title":"to forget is to offend the slave trade legacy nicola lo calzo in pictures","story":"From carnival-goers in the West Indies to voodoo ceremonies in west Africa, Nicola Lo Calzo’s photography confronts us with memories of slavery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f06bff23e24378e6336178f6b9d04f5d80223cc4/586_75_1924_1155/master/1924.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc77a262f3e709b78ea12a5ee1f4dd56","title":"junot diaz sherman alexie morality contract publishers","story":"Offensive opinions. Bullying. Sexual misconduct. As the literary world is rocked by scandal US publishers are asking authors to sign contracts with ‘morality clauses’. Are they really the answer?When the American Libraries Association awards its Andrew Carnegie medals in New Orleans later this month, there will be no winner for excellence in non-fiction. Sherman Alexie, the poet and novelist who was due to receive it for a memoir, You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me, has declined the award following allegations of sexual harassment.Last month, the novelist Junot Díaz withdrew from the Sydney writers’ festival and from chairing the Pulitzer prize board after being confronted by his own accusers. As the allegations swept through social media, another writer, Mary Karr, joined the fray, tweeting of her distress that her testimony to DT Max, the biographer of her one-time partner David Foster Wallace, about Foster Wallace’s abusive behaviour had been marginalised. “Deeply saddened by the allegations against #JunotDiaz \u0026amp I support every woman brave enough to speak. The violence #DavidFosterWallace inflicted on me as a single mom was ignored by his biographer \u0026amp @NewYorker as ‘alleged’ despite my having letters in his hand,” she wrote.Such high profile cases are far from rare as the #MeToo movement spreads across the creative industries. They come at a time when writers are facing increasingly draconian attempts by publishers to police their behaviour, calling into question centuries old assumptions about the desirability – or even the possibility in today’s networked world – of separating writers’ lives from their work.Sexual harassment might be the most acute manifestation of this crisis but it is only one aspect of it. Last year, Simon \u0026amp Schuster cancelled a book by the rightwing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos after comments he had made about sex between men and “younger boys” put an abrupt end to tolerance of his controversialist views. Just months earlier, when the book deal was announced, human rights organisations had rallied to defend the firm’s right to publish his autobiography, Dangerous, however objectionable his views were held to be.Cancelling contracts is a costly and legally dangerous business for publishers – as the Yiannopoulos case revealed. It involved waving goodbye to a reported $250,000 advance, and Simon \u0026amp Schuster only avoided being sued for breach of contract when the disgraced author opted to drop the lawsuit and self-publish instead. The fear among authors and agents is that the case will be seen to strengthen the argument for personal behaviour to be written into author contracts.Clearly, reputation doesn’t matter to a controversialist in the way it does to literary authors such as Alexie or Díaz, who are facing serious damage to their careers. In the weeks since 10 women came forward with accusations against Alexie, the Native American author has been subjected to a cascade of punitive measures. His name has been stripped from a scholarship awarded by the Institute of American Indian Arts, all references to him have been “deleted or modified” in the blog Native Americans in Children’s Literature, bookshops and libraries are destocking his books and his US publisher has said that it will be postponing the paperback of his memoir (though his UK publisher, Penguin Random House, says it will continue to reprint his work as required).Díaz’s US publisher scrapped the publicity schedule for his children’s picture book Islandborn, and his forthcoming public lectures have been cancelled. His UK publisher Oneworld has confirmed it is going ahead with publication, but will postpone it until the autumn. Meanwhile, this month three editors resigned from the Boston Review after the magazine, where Díaz has worked as fiction editor since 2003, announced that it was keeping him on, because “the objectionable conduct described in the public reports does not have the kind of severity that animated the #MeToo movement”.Shortly before the accusations – in what has been denounced by his detractors as a pre-emptive move – Dominican American Díaz wrote a long and moving confessional in the New Yorker about the legacy of damage inflicted on him by being raped as a child. Supporters in the academic world have rallied round him with an open letter in the Chronicle of Higher Education claiming that the “(at times uncritical) reception and repetition of the charges ... amounts to a full-blown media-harassment campaign”. While not dismissing the allegations, the 26 signatories, who include professors from Harvard, Yale, New York, California and Florida, warn that “the … characterization of Díaz as a dangerous and aggressive sexual predator from whom all women must be protected reinforces racist stereotypes”.The high emotions surrounding the behaviour of writers are starkly exemplified by the case of Foster Wallace. Though Karr feels understandably aggrieved that her experience wasn’t taken more seriously by his biographer, she would be wrong to think it wasn’t noted. In a blog written at the time, Kristen Roupenian – who went on to write the New Yorker short story sensation “Cat Person” – described her dismay at discovering in Max’s book that the literary hero she worshipped as a student would probably have dismissed her as “audience pussy”.She wasn’t looking for a boycott of his work, she wrote. “All I expect is a quiet, un-showy disqualification for the role of hero, mentor or saint. I would like the ‘statue’ (Wallace’s word) of his public image to be carefully dismantled, for the overblown ideas we have of him and what his life meant to slowly begin to deflate. I would like him to become just another writer, imbued with no moral authority beyond what is contained in his words on the page.”“Publishers feel an obligation to use their personal social media accounts to publicise books and to go out for drinks,” says Kremer. “People forget that these are not friendships, they are friendly business relationships. You have to understand what’s off limits.”The urgency of addressing these issues is not simply about protecting those who work in the industry, but of finding a way to safeguard the freedom of literature itself. When the Díaz story broke in the US, Elleke Boehmer, professor of world literature in English at Oxford University, considered whether his Pulitzer prize-winning novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao should be taken off her teaching syllabus. Her department decided to let it stay on the grounds that “what would be really valuable would be not to block writers’ voices, but to put others alongside these authors who are now being deplatformed”.“We’ve been here before,” says a senior UK biographer, who declined to be named, citing the furore over Philip Larkin’s racism and misogyny, which threatened to obliterate his reputation after the publication of his Selected Letters in the early 1990s. “Yes, I am fearful that wonderful writers with horrible personal lives are going to fall out of the literary canon because of their terrible behaviour. Puritanism isn’t good for literary understanding.”But these are different times, in which technological changes have created unprecedented forms of accountability. For Kremer, finding a way forward involves responsibility all round – a challenge that is especially tough in an era when reputations can be made or destroyed with an anonymous comment beneath an article, or a single tweet. Her hope is that new, negotiated social contracts will prove more powerful than no-platforming or the imposition of morality clauses that, as Nicola Solomon, CEO of the Society of Authors, points out, could be wrongly invoked to end contracts with writers whom publishers no longer wanted for reasons that had nothing to do with their morality.Writers have a central role to play in exploring the nuances of the new, wired environment, whether through short stories, such as Roupenian’s “Cat Person”, which investigates the politics of unwanted sex, or novels such as Lisa Halliday’s recent Asymmetry, which examines the perils of cultural asymmetry in terms of both a young editor’s relationship with an famous older writer, and the right of a white, female writer to describe the experience of a young Iraqi-American man.As Warner said in her speech: “Striving to be good is not the same as good writing. Engaging in fictive truth-telling is not the same as winning gold stars for conduct.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc8fd2ed774b06730f9c76ed4b0fb8a9e7b39a49/0_215_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a8cb8d7e2ade784329db3292beb9585","title":"what is manchester one mans mission to photograph a citys essence","story":"Following the Manchester Arena attack, Paul Dobraszczyk spent one year, 80 walks, 300 miles and 9,000 photographs trying to capture what unites the cityOne of the strongest responses to the suicide bombing at the Manchester Arena last May was a call for unity: for Mancunians of every persuasion to be strong and stand together. Like so many others, I felt a need to identify with the city and its people, to respond in some way that keyed into this desire for solidarity.I decided to immerse myself in the city by walking the streets and building an archive of photographs. With the edges of Manchester’s city centre in the throes of breakneck redevelopment that is seeing the construction of dozens of high-rise luxury apartment blocks, I wanted to find what had endured beyond this bubble of speculative building – and to find something that might counter it.Tony Walsh’s 2012 poem This is the Place – read to a crowd of thousands the day after the attack – spoke passionately of Manchester as a city with a distinct identity that embraced international clout (music and football) and defiant localism (cups of tea and cobbled streets). But a question kept coming back to me: what exactly is Manchester – where does it begin and end? Strictly speaking, the city of Manchester is only a small part of a wider metropolitan region: the county of Greater Manchester, created in 1974, which brought together 10 metropolitan boroughs and two cities – Salford and Manchester – under a larger urban identity. Yet for me that wider urban region – which at 493 square miles is nearly as big as Greater London – meant very little, because I’d not had cause to visit many areas outside of the city centre.One year, 80 walks, 300 miles and 9,000 photographs later, I am still overwhelmed by the sheer variety of places, buildings and people. Everywhere was different and yet so much recurred. There was a whole family of buildings, both fanciful and mundane, that developed out of the co-operative movement, which began in Rochdale in the 1840s and quickly spread to the whole urban region and far beyond. There were the dozen or so libraries scattered around the region that were funded by Andrew Carnegie in the early 20th century (and most of which, thankfully, were still open – proof of a longstanding communal loyalty to these buildings). And there were the cotton mills: towering brick edifices in various states of disrepair that grew out of Manchester’s role in the industrial revolution as the global centre of cotton production. While many of these mills have now been demolished, hundreds still remain standing as testament to the industry that once united this enormous urban region and gave it a distinct working-class identity.For me though, it was the more mundane things that brought a sense of unity to Greater Manchester: the electricity substations, often built in a housing style, that told you which borough you were in the hundreds of Victorian terraces that still make up the majority of the region’s housing stock, which manage to be both uniform and endlessly varied in their small details and a gamut of ghost signs that identified lost industries from Manchester’s days as Cottonopolis. And then there were the bees – symbols of civic pride invented by the Victorians that were transformed in the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing into icons of defiance, unity and strength. Countless bee stickers now adorn cars and windows, bee tattoos mark bodies, and bee paintings and murals enliven walls.Chance encounters along the way backed up the commonly held idea that people in the north of England are friendlier on many of my walks, people were keen to point out local landmarks and interesting buildings they’d grown up with. People were generally quick to identify themselves with the larger urban region, explicitly or otherwise. A farmer in Tyldesley spoke of the enormous pipes under his land that brought fresh water from Thirlmere in Cumbria to Manchester a pensioner in Bramhall told me how lucky he felt to be living in Stockport – half a mile away, outside Greater Manchester, he wouldn’t be entitled to free travel on public transport.It is these networks – the hidden infrastructures and invisible boundaries – that are perhaps the most important things that bring unity to a sprawling area. And yet there are still great disparities in Greater Manchester: for instance the woeful Northern Rail network that, for many is the only form of transport available apart from buses.I had not expected to come across architectural wonders outside the centre. So I am aghast that very few guides to Manchester include any detail on buildings such as Rochdale Town Hall, completed in 1871 and to my mind one of the finest Victorian buildings in the country. They also make little mention of the Monastery in Gorton, a monumental edifice completed in 1872 and reopened as a community hub in 2007. It is a gothic rampart that towers over one of the poorest districts of the city. And nowhere did I find reference to the joyous exuberance of many of the region’s mosques, or the astonishing 1930s stained glass that fills the church of St Oswald \u0026amp St Edmund Arrowsmith in Ashton-in-Makerfield.Of course, no single resource can offer an exhaustive visual record of the built environment and there are many types of building that I’ve not covered. My project, The Stones of Manchester, is more of an invitation to see the city anew to connect erse and fragmentary views to embrace the commonplace, often ignored things that make the area feel as though it belongs to us. In cities, it is what continues to endure, be it houses, amenities or infrastructure, that provides an anchor around which communities can flourish. In other words, precisely the opposite of what is currently happening in the heartland of Manchester, where buildings for the rich are disregarding not only the history of the city but also the people that made it.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7632b02e40c5fbe0842864087bf88e474c18b70e/458_0_3332_2000/master/3332.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=589465a1caf5269c6d5191e7a6484a98","title":"suits fruit and scooters 30 years of hanois 36 streets in pictures","story":"William E Crawford was one of the first western photographers to work in postwar north Vietnam.

Yes, there will also be singing. About the dark times.” Last Sunday, in a service at St Clement’s church, where many took shelter on the first night after the Grenfell fire, there was indeed singing. We sang the words of June Boyce-Tillman’s stirring hymn: “We shall go out, from strength to strength go on … We’ll make the tunes for those who sing no longer.” Over the past year survivors from Grenfell Tower, bereaved families and the communities around them have faced the very darkest of times. But in them they have also shown us a spirit of solidarity and resilience, of\u0026nbsplove and hope.It was there from the first. Three days after the fire at Grenfell, in the chaos, heat and dust, a trail of hearts appeared in chalk in Ladbroke Grove. It led to Maxilla Gardens, where the local artist Sophie Lodge sat making heart-shaped frames out of willow, covering them with wet-strength tissue paper. Sophie would make 24 hearts, one for each floor of Grenfell Tower. Today’s regular silent walks feature large green hearts made from willow frames, emblazoned with the words “dignity”, “grace”, “justice”, “peace”, “truth”, “love”.I walked past Sophie and her fellow heart-makers that day, and for many days afterwards. Near the Rugby Portobello club, where a crowd of mostly young people waited for news, I saw Susan Rudnik, a local resident I’d known before the fire, putting up posters for an art therapy centre she was setting up on her estate, where I used to work. An art psychotherapist, Susan wrote a powerful report titled “Out of the darkness”, in which she recorded how children from local schools drew spontaneous memorials on the streets. Every public space, every pavement was full of donations, and people just kept arriving.A friend said to me recently that people bring what skills they have in a crisis. The residents of W10 and W11 brought love. At the makeshift memorials, people gathered to write names and messages of support on the walls. Someone spray-painted “strength” in huge capital letters. People tied ribbons on railings and put flowers in vases. They cut, sewed and crocheted. They cleaned up and cleared rubbish from the tributes. They tended plants. Later, when the cold weather came, they wrapped them in cellophane.As we pause to reflect on the past year, we should remember all this: the role of the community, how it came together, how it was they who provided the humanitarian response when the government’s was so completely lacking, and how this extended into the weeks and months that followed.As for me, I walked around looking for ways to help, trying to make out faces I\u0026nbspknew. In the centres at St Clement’s, the Harrow Club, the Notting Hill Methodist church, the Al Manaar centre, Kensal Resource Centre, Acklam Village, donations were sorted and labelled. I\u0026nbspchecked social media groups to see where they needed help, then shifted boxes on Kensal Road, opposite the offices of the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO), where I had worked several years before. I half-expected to bump into ex-colleagues and face their disapproval for going public about the organisation’s failings. I needn’t have worried – KCTMO, like the council, was nowhere to be seen.No, it was the local community who looked after the needs of survivors. Looking back, Andrea Newton, who lives on the Lancaster West Estate and is member of the steering group there, believes that it was local residents’ “overwhelming outpouring of love and generosity” that got people through the sleepless days and months that followed. “The concept of residents assisting residents is known to be the key to recovery around the world and residents of North Kensington seemed to instinctively fall into this role for each other. Caring for another person aided your own recovery.” It continues to this day.There was, for instance, the Grenfell Muslim Response Unit. This new organisation, funded by the National Zakat Foundation, was one of those able to respond in a quick and dynamic way to the needs of those on the ground.Everyone has been inspired by the dignity of bereaved families and survivors, and by Grenfell United’s quiet approach to seeking justice. That early community spirit has transformed into organising for the greater good, locally and nationally, urging the government to abide by the recommendations of the inquiry and campaigning to make homes safe across the country. We\u0026nbspwould do well to carry these qualities into other areas of public life, to learn from this community how to\u0026nbspbe kinder to each other.Grenfell Speaks, a social media channel for the transparent broadcast of public meetings and the voices of the bereaved, survivors and the local community, has repeatedly held both local and national government officials to account. Residents have established gardening projects, childcare projects. They have co-designed health and wellbeing services and advocacy groups for better housing services across the borough and country. Artistic projects involving young people have helped them translate some of their experiences.It would be a lie to say all this has been easy. Of course there has been anger, especially in the early, chaotic times. People have encountered extreme suffering and mental anguish. The NHS estimates that 11,000 people have been affected in the locality alone. And a new report from a local law centre, NKLC, says the delays in rehousing have added to the community’s suffering. Nevertheless, acts of solidarity and kindness continue to tend to the emotional wounds. Monthly silent walks bring people together to remember the reasons for this sudden traumatic tearing of a community’s fabric on the loss of 72 lives and the displacement of hundreds more.This week is a time of reflection. The green heart has become a symbol representing hope for all groups in the community. Carried on silent marches and now taken to other cities throughout the country, the willow hearts bring with them the spirit of the Grenfell communities – those who were bereaved and those who\u0026nbspwere displaced. Those who tended the memorials, day after day: changing water in the flowers, removing litter, cleaning the teddy bears. There is now a sign at Maxilla Gardens which reads, “Heart fixing”.Those affected by the fire do not need anyone to speak for them. They are writing this story themselves – with their dignity, their actions, and in the way they live. For 12 months they have had to fight for justice and yet the inquiry, which everyone hopes will deliver a meaningful outcome (though many fear won’t), has only just begun. There are still so many issues that need to be resolved. But the community has demonstrated a strength, resilience and love that few of us will see the like of again. They deserve justice. They will not give up. And they will continue to exhibit the virtues so beautifully evoked by those green hearts. Dignity. Unity. Grace. Peace. Justice. Love.• Seraphima Kennedy is a writer and academic researcher.

Images of the fire, trapped residents silhouetted in the windows, and the blackened husk that remains beneath the scaffolding – topped for Thursday’s anniversary by a banner with the green heart that is the survivors’ symbol – will surely never leave those who saw them. Shock ricocheted around the city and far beyond.The next day, the  compared Theresa May to George W Bush following Hurricane Katrina. Just a week after the general election failed to secure the mandate she sought, the prime minister’s inadequate response to the tragedy appeared to confirm every doubt about her. Twelve months on, the government has shaken off this torpor. Last month Mrs May agreed to appoint a panel to work with the inquiry’s chair, Martin Moore-Bick. On Monday, the housing and communities secretary, James Brokenshire, invoked Winston Churchill when he called Grenfell one of Britain’s “darkest hours”, and repeated a promise to consult on banning combustible cladding.It is the inquiry’s job to decide, along with the police and courts, where the blame lies. The fire service Kensington and Chelsea council and tenant management organisation the contractors and manufacturers involved in the refurbishment safety inspectors ministers who oversaw the weakening of regulations over several decades and promoted complex procurement processes: all must answer for their actions. In light of past mistakes, not least the failure to heed the many warnings – local, national and international – that could have prevented this fire, the Grenfell campaigners are more than justified in demanding that the government should commit now to implementing the inquiry’s recommendations.We cannot bring their 72 loved ones back. We can build\u0026nbspthem a legacy that goes beyond the nuts and bolts\u0026nbspof liability for this fire. The situation regarding hundreds of other blocks with Grenfell-style cladding is mired in confusion, with court cases likely to drag on for years. But the problems go deeper. What the disaster\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspits aftermath brought home in the most savage way is that we have lost our bearings with regard to housing. Ever since right to buy enshrined home ownership as an ideal, renters have been second-class citizens. The many homes sitting empty and lightly taxed demonstrate that making money, not providing shelter, has become the point of housing. Slashing regulation, because this boosts profits, has been the priority – even at the expense\u0026nbspof safety. When a coroner recommended tighter regulations and the fitting of sprinklers, following a cladding fire in which\u0026nbspsix people died at Lakanal House, south London, in 2009, ministers did\u0026nbspnothing.But if the direction of travel has been unchanged since Margaret Thatcher, the balance of power has tilted ever more sharply in favour of landlords, with the bedroom tax and criminalisation of squatting among other changes introduced since 2010. Rightwing politicians and thinktanks proclaim that living in central London is a privilege, not a right – even if your grandparents grew up in the neighbourhood, you work there and your children are in a local school. Demolitions and transfers to the private sector of homes that were once state-owned have picked up pace, forcing thousands of people to relocate, including leaseholders who exercised their right to buy only to find their properties bought back by councils using compulsory purchase orders.Three decades of public policy has failed even on its own terms, with home ownership rates collapsing. There is no quick fix to the problem of price inflation. There are ways to protect renters. In January, London MP Karen Buck won government backing for a bill that will force landlords including councils to make homes “fit for human habitation”. Building control and fire safety must be overhauled and enforcement strengthened. Democratic accountability must be restored, and residents balloted where regeneration is proposed. Developers must be challenged and the stranglehold of the big housebuilders broken. Above all, councils must be freed to borrow to build.It’s not hard to see how Grenfell’s botched refurbishment could feed arguments in favour of demolitions, and questions about the desirability of high-rise living will not go away. But the tragedy can also teach us a lesson about the value of social housing per se. Nye Bevan, who was housing as well as health secretary in the 1945 Labour government, spoke of the desirability of doctors and farm labourers “living in the same street”. Mixed communities are part of the point of subsidised housing, and Grenfell thrust this fact into the heart of public debate. Confusingly, Kensington and Chelsea became a symbol of polarisation – with its poor north and rich south – but also of how the principle has endured: this was still one borough after all, and cabinet ministers lived down the road. Though there were vulnerable people among them, Grenfell’s 350 ethnically and religiously mixed residents were not, as some early reports suggested, the wretched of the earth: they were busy, happy families, with jobs and friends and hopes and children – 18 of them among the deceased – who were excelling at school.It won’t arrive with the same fanfare as the NHS’s 70th birthday. But next year marks the 70th anniversary of another key postwar achievement: the 1949 Housing Act. This most battered pillar of the welfare state urgently needs rebuilding. Being sorry for what happened at Grenfell is not enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f237c606bea7a8c7ace162f1e0c9aebba617e91/0_0_650_394/master/650.jpg?w=645\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=34775ea8e4f6bb6d04fe5f4861e93c4e 1290w","title":"can cricket become the game of choice for young bme women","story":"Cricket has a huge following among the BME community – particularly south Asians – yet few women try their hand at the sport. Two Leicestershire women have set out to change thatGrowing up in Pakistan, Nafeesa Katib remembers watching cricket with her siblings on a TV hired at the weekend as a treat. It wasn’t a viewing choice at the time – it was the only thing being broadcast – but she remembers it fondly. “Even if we didn’t like cricket we had to watch it, and in the end all of us fell in love with the game,” she says. She remembers thinking: “Where are all the women on the cricket field?” That thought stuck with her after she moved to the UK as a teenager. Now 41, and living in Leicestershire with her husband and two children of her own, she is helping to redress that imbalance, in her role as a cricket coach for girls aged eight to 14. Her hope is to be a role model to all the girls who attend her sessions – but also to show, as a visibly Muslim woman playing and teaching cricket, that a headscarf need not stop anyone playing sport. “If you’ve got somebody who inspires you, who shows you, yes, I can do it, it’s a great feeling. And that’s what I try do,” says Katib.Women’s cricket has never been more popular in the UK – 2017 was a landmark year, as millions watched the England team triumph in the Women’s Cricket World Cup in front of a sold-out crowd at Lord’s. In the wake of that result, the cricket governing board said it was committed to getting more south Asian women involved in the game.One reason is the lack of appropriate coaching and facilities. In Oadby, where Katib lives, there were no organised sporting activities for her nine-year-old daughter on a Saturday morning – until cricket came along. “Most of the things are aimed at boys, like the football clubs for example,” says Katib. “There were some crafty things for girls, but not all girls are into arts and crafts.”Her friend and fellow coach Mai Kazi emphasises that the scheduling of sports sessions can be an issue, particularly for kids who come from a Muslim background. “Most of the Muslim kids in the area go to Islamic school between 4pm and 6pm, and that’s when most of the clubs are held,” says Kazi. But a Saturday morning works perfectly for her and her 13-year-old daughter, and the sessions are something they now do together. The coaches have worked hard to create a safe environment for girls from all backgrounds, who might be feeling apprehensive about throwing themselves into the game.“There are a few girls who wear headscarves,” says Katib. “The first time they came they were very nervous and really worried about them, with one hand touching their head at all times. But over time I’ve been able to give them a bit of confidence. At the end of the day, it’s all girls there.”Although having women run the sessions has boosted participation from the local Muslim and south Asian community, it’s the sight of two familiar faces that encourages parents to keep bringing their kids back. “A lot of the mums that drop their girls off know us from school,” says Kazi. “We live in a very small borough, so it’s the kind of place where everyone knows each other. There is obviously the sense of: ‘Oh, this is run by someone we know.’”She believes that community feeling is essential to the project’s success: “The fact it’s very local has really appealed to people – otherwise, they’d have to travel to Leicester, which isn’t always possible.”Katib has just completed her level two coaching certificate and hopes, one day, to run her own club. But the key thing for her is to keep showing her daughter there’s no such thing as a sport girls can’t do.“I’ve never wanted my daughter to think that certain things are only for girls, and that certain things are only for boys,” she says. “There shouldn’t be any limitations for anything.” In 2017 one of the key elements of Natwest’s partnership with the ECB was to help raise funding to open up even more opportunities for young people, both male and female, to enjoy cricket. This will continue in 2018.As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981.

Entrepreneurial experts share their hard-learned lessons, from the genuinely useful to what to avoidDon’t get lost in the crowdYou may think your product is better than everything else, but without something distinctive about it, it’s not going to stand out. “When I do consultancy work occasionally and, say, someone’s made a new T-shirt, I’ll say: ‘What’s so good about it?’” says Kuldip Singh Sahota, founder and chief executive of Mr Singh’s chilli sauces and crisps. “They’ll say, the fabric or design, but that’s what everyone says. What’s going to make you stand out? That’s where your brand and authenticity comes in, especially in such a crowded market.”Dave Bailey, a business coach and entrepreneur, agrees: “When you’re starting a new business, you have to get people to believe what you believe. And they’re never going to believe someone they think is fake or doing it for the wrong reasons.”Do have a good storyIt’s the entrepreneur who can spin a good yarn who gains a head start. For Sahota, that was the chilli sauce recipe his father Hardev “Pops” Singh Sahota had perfected over decades in the family’s shed in east London. They now sell sauces globally.“Everyone loves a good story, don’t they,” says Sahota. “It’s something customers can relate to but also, in our case, it helped us stand out with retailers who we wanted to stock our products.” To highlight the backstory, Sahota cast his father in a series of online comedy music videos to promote the brand.Don’t think all advice is good adviceIf launching a business or a product is like having a baby, entrepreneurs face a similar barrage of well-meaning, often contradictory advice from family, friends and a million business books. “Sarah Wood, the co-founder of the video ad tech company Unruly, once said the best piece of advice she ever got was that advice itself was overrated,” says startups’s Shane Donnelly.Sahota hates the kind of motivational self-help quotes that flood Instagram – “An investment in yourself pays the best interest” and all that sort of thing. “It starts off really well intentioned but it can really get on top of you after a while, so I ignore it all now,” he says.Do ask for experience not advice“A lot of advice is regret in disguise,” Bailey says. “Everyone’s got an experience, but rather than ask for advice, I often recommend asking for that experience.” In other words, not so much “what would you do?” but “what did you do?” – then make your own decision.“The worst advice I got was when I called this big wholesaler in east London and he said: ‘My biggest piece of advice for you is just quit, this is really hard’”, Sahota recalls. “And then he goes: ‘I’ll take a pallet off you if you want.’ And I remember thinking: ‘You told me to quit but you also want a pallet of my sauces? I’ll show you.’”Don’t stick with a product beyond its sell by dateBuilding a product around yourself only enhances your emotional attachment to your baby, but attachment parenting can be bad when things get tricky. “Where people come unstuck is they fall in love with their first creation and stay with it even when the evidence is against it,” says Bailey.“Holding a sentimental attachment to elements that just aren’t working will do your startup no long-term favours,” Donnelly adds.Do go back to the beginningIf sales or interest in your product aren’t what you had hoped, Bailey suggests going back to page one of your story. “Remember what it was that first motivated you,” he says. “What problem were you trying to solve? You have to be open to trying 10 or 20 different solutions and seeing what works.”For Sahota, the first element was working – his sauces were popular and central to his story – but to satisfy investors and progress as a business, he knew the answer was to make his crisps work. “And we should have made that move a lot sooner,” he says. “But I felt like I couldn’t look beyond the sauces unless I was dead.”Don’t look like an amateurIt doesn’t matter how good your story is if you come up short when talk turns serious. “You’ve got to have that nice soft exterior to connect but when you sit down with the supermarket or an investor, they have to know you mean business,” says Sahota. “You need to be able to say: ‘When you put my product on your shelves, I’ll drive customers in to your store because I’ve got followers who want it and I will add value to the category.’ That is hugely important for retailers.”Do ask the right questionsCustomer research is vital for any new business. “But people always ask their customers: ‘Would you use this product that does this cool thing,’” says Bailey. “But that’s a leading question. They’ll say: ‘Yes’ – and that looks like validation. But you should be asking about experience and behaviour.”Knowing how someone lives will help you to see how your product fits into people’s lives.To do this, Bailey suggests directing people to a landing page on your website and setting up a waiting list long before you launch anything, and then having a conversation with those people on the waiting list. “Even if you just get 10 people, that also means they feel the problem you’re trying to solve. And if nobody signs up, that tells you something, too.”Don’t fall into bad habitsKnowing how to structure each day – and what to do – can be tough for a solo starter, particularly one who has come out of an office environment. “You need to create really good habits straight away,” Sahota says. “There’ll be days when it’s really hard and those habits will get you through even if you’ve run out of willpower or motivation.” The sauce entrepreneur sets himself daily goals. “It could be something really simple like sending one really good email to a potential lead and following it with a phone call. On some days it’s good to set your goals low so you feel like you’ve achieved something.”Do take care of number one“Basically, get enough sleep and you’re halfway there,” Bailey says. “I used to work for a big consultancy, working all hours and travelling, and I hated the lifestyle. When I started my first business I was like: ‘I’m going to take my work-life balance seriously.’ Nonetheless, two years later, an investor turns to me during a crisis and says: ‘Dave, here’s what you’re going to do. You’re going to take a holiday for a week and come back to this fresh.’ It was what I needed.”Now you’re well versed in the major dos and don’ts, it’s time to get down to business.

That the British retailer is in financial trouble, with 100 stores to close in the next four years, is well-documented, as are claims that it has forgotten who its target customer is. But judging by its autumnwinter 2018 womenswear presentation in London on Tuesday, the potential is there: next season is all about quality, consistency and rediscovering its core customer.“This is heartland M\u0026ampS,” said the company’s style director, Belinda Earl, introducing the new foundation edit she described as “the mainstays of any woman’s working wardrobe”. It includes a city coat, a black blazer, a pair of black trousers and a striped Breton top. The focus at M\u0026ampS this season is to provide beautifully executed staples that women can wear day to night, throughout the year, every year things that, says Earl, “we’re known for and want to be known for even more to build a broader customer base”.There remain seasonal trend items with which to mix and match, such as statement T-shirts, metallic pleated skirts and – something the design team are predicting will be a hit – a buckled kilt that comes in traditional tartan as well as black. There are also several contenders for the “new pink coat”, including a long Prince of Wales check coat, £99 a long shearling-style coat, £99 and (the style that everyone will want) a faux-fur leopard-print teddy-bear coat, £79.However, the emphasis on understanding what M\u0026ampS has historically been really good at – knitwear, outerwear and underwear – is clear and will be what they are hoping bring back to the masses. Trousers come in multiple cuts and colourways, as does knitwear, while tailoring is available in classic heritage patterns and materials. At the presentation, the design team showcased its clothes alongside underwear to show it has approached this collection with a more holistic idea of how women dress – ie choosing what bra and knickers to wear depending on what we want to put on top. Crucially, though, these mainstays won’t be one-season wonders, but will reappear next season and the one after that.“It’s something that we’re very conscious of doing,” said Earl. “When you do find a piece, you tend to want more and we’re looking to build on that. It’s a big reminder to us and the customer that those are the pieces that should be the focus of everyone’s wardrobe.”Earl remains positive. For womenswear, she says, “having a tighter focus does make things clearer”.

It would almost certainly have the backing of Europe, pending other bids from the continent, with Uefa’s president, Aleksander Ceferin, praising the FA chairman, Greg Clarke, for overhauling the “arrogant” image of English football.Ceferin was buoyant about England’s ability to host a 48-team tournament. “England has fantastic infrastructure, experience and everything else,” he said. “As much as we are trying to be neutral now we will certainly not be neutral if anyone from Europe bids. Greg Clarke has changed that image very much, he’s travelling around, he’s showing a different face and I think he’s very popular in Europe. The English FA is doing well.”The FA is understood to have taken encouragement from the transparent voting process for the 2026 World Cup during Fifa’s annual congress in Moscow on Wednesday. Minutes after the United 2026 bid was announced as the winner, a large screen in the room flashed up how every federation had voted. It was a marked contrast to England’s failed campaign in 2010, when they suffered a bruising defeat by Russia and the voting remained hidden amid suspicions of foul play.Any England bid could also take heart from the voting federations opting for United 2026 as the host. The joint bid by the United States, Canada and Mexico was vastly superior on technical grounds to that of Morocco, receiving four out of five in a Fifa bid evaluation report, compared with Morocco’s 2.7 out of five.David Gill, a Fifa vice-president and former Manchester United chief executive, was encouraged by the new voting process. “What it does is gives great confidence that the procedures in place now are appropriate and relevant,” he said. “If you’ve got a product then it’s up to the company selling that product to actually demonstrate what’s required, review that and then come up with the answer.“Both bids were very good but if you are four out of five versus 2.7 out of five – what is best for football – the best bid has won.”Gill said he would relish an English World Cup. “Why wouldn’t you? If you love football, to see it on your doorstep. You look at the assets that we’ve got in England, or the UK, in terms of grounds. Some of the best grounds in world football the best training grounds. It would be fantastic.”A redirection of resources at the FA suggests it is looking at a possible bid for 2030. The director of communications, Rob Sullivan, is to be placed in charge of a bolstered international department and given additional responsibilities. His role is expected to involve managing the seven games at Wembley during Euro 2020, the bid to host the women’s European Championship in 2021 and preparing the ground for a possible World Cup bid. It is understood that the FA will spend the next 12 months assessing the positives and negatives of campaigning to host football’s showpiece for the first time since 1966.Ceferin suggested teaming up with the home nations for a joint bid would put them in an even stronger position. “It’s always a bit stronger bid with more countries,” he said. “But at the same time if we are talking about England with their infrastructure they can host on their own or with the rest of the UK.”Any England bid would face opposition from the joint campaign of Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay. It is also possible there will be an African bid, especially in light of Morocco’s defeat over 2026. If the home nations do not submit a joint bid Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland may have the opportunity to vote despite a potential conflict of interest. The Fifa council has discussed amending the rule under which the US-governed territories of Guam, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands were forced into abstaining from voting on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce755e218854398adb3db6988a9135f1eb5a71af/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4489de7469a6b160509199c242388c8","title":"fast friends world cup squads dealt with ramadan","story":"Fasting during daylight hours is obligatory during the Muslim festival, and the seven teams in Russia from largely Islamic nations have found various ways of tackling the issueAs World Cup 2018 begins in Russia, the Muslim festival of Ramadan is ending around the world. With fasting during daylight hours obligatory for all adults, Ramadan provides challenges for seven nations taking part in the World Cup with majority or large Muslim populations. Here is how the squads from each country have responded.Russia’s opponents in the opening fixture, Saudi Arabia will play their first match during Ramadan. Moreover, their base in St Petersburg is currently experiencing 18 hours of daylight. Faced with such strictures, the majority of the Saudi camp have opted to defer their fast till after the tournament. Citing travel as a cause for postponement is a common dispensation during Ramadan. It was given the rubber stamp by Saudi authorities who issued abstention permits to players who required them.In the Islamic Republic of Iran, there has not been much complaining about the effects of Ramadan on athletic conditioning. “Ramadan does not really affect training” said the forward Reza Ghoochannejhad. President Hassan Rouhani drew a direct parallel between fasting and training. “You go to the gym to prepare yourself for an important international competition,” he said. “ The month of Ramadan is the gym for all of us. It is about patience and resistance.” Due to the ergent nature of the Ramadan calendar in different countries, Iranian players will not have finished fasting by the time they play Morocco on Friday.Of all the countries facing the fasting dilemma, Morocco have been the most circumspect. Fasting in their country also comes to an end on Friday night, after the crucial group B opener with Iran, but neither the Moroccan FA nor the religious body that issues fatwas in Morocco, the Higher Council of Ulema, have commented on the team’s preparations.The Egyptian FA hired nutritional specialists to ensure Ramadan caused minimal disruption to their preparations. The outcome was not entirely successful, however, as the team failed to win a single pre-tournament match. A number of clerics weighed in with interpretations of whether athletes were able to break the fast and, if so, for how long. The FA issued a statement insisting they were “determined” to last the entire month but Egypt’s Grand Mufti Shawki Allam granted exemption to the team.Nigeria’s heterogenous religious mix has left coach Gernot Rohr with fewer challenges than some of his peers in African football. He has, however, been more outspoken about the consequences of fasting. The forward Ahmed Musa and defender Shehu Abdullahi have both been observing Sawm and, despite Nigeria not playing until Sunday, Rohr is expected to rest the pair. “For the first game, it will not be easy to put it fasting away,” the German said. “It will be difficult to regain the energy lost in such a short time.”A majority Muslim country, Senegal have faced the same issues. “Everyone knows that high-level football isn’t compatible with Ramadan,” the coach Aliou Cissé, himself a Muslim, told local media. “I am responsible for the health of these players.” Cissé did not elaborate on how he planned to address the issue, but it has been reported in Senegal that the players collectively agreed not to fast ahead of the World Cup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8095f3dbc45ba94984017b25a6a508ef84d17cbd/0_195_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90bda674e1dc4ca5dcea9bbbaf9920ca","title":"football anthony martial agent leave manchester united jose mourinho","story":"Anthony Martial wants to leave Manchester United, according to his agent. The 22-year-old, who joined United from Monaco for £36m in September 2015, has found life at Old Trafford increasingly frustrating under José Mourinho, with limited opportunities from the bench.The forward was not included in France’s squad for the World Cup having struggled to make much impact at United since Mourinho’s arrival.On Wednesday night, his representative, Philippe Lamboley, insisted that “the time has come” for the player to move on.Lamboley told RMC Sport: “After thinking about all the factors and possibilities, Anthony wants to leave Manchester United. There are lots of factors, and right now it’s too early to talk about them. Manchester United want Anthony to extend his deal and do not want him to leave but we have not reached an agreement for several months.“I think that when Manchester United, the most powerful club in the world, do not find an agreement after eight months of negotiations then they do not really want to keep such an important player in their squad. That’s why this decision has come – it’s a well-thought-out decision.“It’s important to remember that he is under contract and that Manchester United will have the last word. We will respect the club’s decision and he will stick with his commitment to the end.“Anthony is disappointed because he has shown his love for the club and the supporters for three seasons. Without the unconditional support of the fans he would have already asked to leave United. I think he has done his best for three years and it is important to remember that he scored 11 goals and made 10 assists in five months of last season.“Everyone will have their opinion but I think he needs to resume his career.

And while it is too late in the game to do anything about it, ultimately it sends a very bad message to clean athletes.”In December 2016 the McLaren report found that more than 1,000 Russian athletes in 30 sports had been part of state-sponsored doping programme, including footballers. Seven months earlier, the Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov revealed how his country’s athletes had their urine samples manipulated at the 2014 Winter Olympics to avoid positive tests.When asked if he worried about a repeat of Sochi, Tygart responded: “Unfortunately the weak and political decisions that the International Olympic Committee and Wada made in dealing with Russia has caused a lot of people to ask that question. We can’t be naive when it looks like you can steal and not be held accountable.”Tygart also raised the possibility that Russian hackers Fancy Bears, which he described as “a unit of the Russian government”, could be active during the World Cup. And he said that athletes in some sports were worried about competing in Russia at all because of the possibility of “false positive” doping tests.“Remember the McLaren report that indicated that the minister’s office told Rodchenkov to create a false positive for a Ukrainian athlete and that served the interest of Russia,” he said. “Athletes have expressed their concern for the security around doping - and possibility getting a false positive that has been intentionally created to take them down. It is an environment that is really scary for athletes.”Tygart also warned there were voices in the IOC and Wada who wanted Russia to be brought back in from the cold, despite not fulfilling two key obligations of Wada’s roadmap - accepting the McLaren investigation and permitting access to the Moscow laboratory and providing the data necessary to ensure justice on hundreds of outstanding cases. And he said he expected a “showdown” between Wada and Russia over the reinstatement.“The IOC is pushing to draw a line under the Russian doping scandal,” said Tygart. “That would be a total disaster and if Wada allows it to happen, without the Russians meeting the roadmap, it will be a devastating blow to its credibility. I think people are genuinely concerned that is going to happen and it has the appearance of a total set up. If possible the IOC will allow it to go away. So it is incumbent on everyone who agrees that clean sport matters, to ensure that it doesn’t.”Tygart also called for Wada’s funding model to be changed so that it is no longer funded half by the IOC and half by governments, and said he supported a levy on broadcast rights instead. “Unfortunately Wada is really doomed to fail in its current structure unless it has pretty significant changes that makes it free from the conflict of interest - and those who have an interest not to promote clean sport,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59ea8144151da8dc1b55dd962b79d374f887f40c/0_90_2073_1244/master/2073.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47d7bda4b6dd2c65ea5551ec7a4469ad","title":"strikers coach allan russell long route russia england","story":"Russell is on England’s staff at the World Cup to work specifically with the forwards after being inspired by coaching methods in the USGlance along the second row of suited England players and staff on their official World Cup squad photograph and the focus is drawn to an unfamiliar face at the end of the line. Allan Russell, once a journeyman striker at clubs from St Mirren to Macclesfield, stands next to Nick Pope and behind Trent Alexander-Arnold, a Scot with the Three Lions badge on his breast pocket.England’s travelling party to Russia is 58 strong, but it is a measure of the esteem in which Gareth Southgate holds the 37-year-old that he joins the assistant manager, Steve Holland, and the goalkeeping coach, Martyn Margetson, in making the cut for the team picture. Russell is a specialist attacking coach, the self-styled “superior striker”, who has been involved in the set-up for around a year having previously focused his efforts on inidual forwards up and down the leagues, or with clubs on an ad-hoc basis. Those included Chelsea, who had Holland on their staff at the time.Russell worked with players such as Andre Gray, Benik Afobe, Alexander Mitrovic and Saido Berahino before linking up with England, with his task now to improve a record which has seen the team score 27 goals in Southgate’s 18 games. The Glaswegian had a nomadic career that took in spells, not all prolific, at five Scottish clubs and three in England’s lower leagues.“I took aspects of that into what I am doing now. I could never understand why, as a striker, they are not given specific training which allows them to work on their movement, awareness, timing of the runs and execution of the finish.”Russell was prominently involved in England’s first session at the Spartak Zelenogorsk Stadium, and will hope to work again with Marcus Rashford on Thursday when the Manchester United forward is expected to return from a knock to a knee, sustained before the team’s departure for Russia.Eric Dier, who trained with heavy strapping to his left thigh, has said he is not carrying an injury and is fit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ca72531340e5474c77a3d30a1ceb13869a3d402/312_0_3343_2007/master/3343.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=341c48141403d362f91ba8fc4e888bfd","title":"world cup welcome baltic sea england excuses russia","story":"Luxury mattresses have been shipped to the team hotel and family photos put up by the FA but heat of Volgograd is a worryAt least England’s footballers are getting an easier ride than their Russian counterparts right now. “Destined for defeat” was the headline in Wednesday’s edition of the Moscow Times, complete with a team photograph of these apparent no-hopers. Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un were all bumped off the front page for the newspaper to make its point: “Ageing and inexperienced: why Russia is doomed to fail.”Four hundred and fifty miles north-east on the Gulf of Finland, the mood was considerably lighter. Teenage locals with foam hands showed the guests to their seats for England’s first training session at the Stadium Spartak Zelenogorsk, set in a pine forest close to the Baltic Sea. People from the village came with gifts – bread, salt and a golden teapot – and the players were only an hour or so late for the reception. “Applaud to keep warm,” came the message from the woman with the microphone, as the wind picked up and the temperatures dropped.In fairness, the weather was not too bad and if you watched Frankie Boyle’s BBC documentary on Russia, it is fair to say that Repino, in keeping with most seaside resorts, is more pleasant in the summer than it is out of season, when the sea freezes over and the line comes to mind – copyright: Morrissey – about the coastal town that they forgot to close down.It will be a lot hotter in Volgograd, though, when England play Tunisia on Monday in their first assignment of Group G and would it be too impudent to wonder whether, in hindsight, the Football Association might have been better sticking by its original choice of a warmer base? Too late now, of course, but when Gareth Southgate decided the heat and humidity of a Black Sea resort might be too oppressive he would not have known their opening game would take place in another city where the temperatures will be close to 30C. Sweden took the hotel, the Kempinski Grand, that had been earmarked for the England team in Gelendzhik and Southgate’s men will have to acclimatise the best they can when they fly to Volgograd on Sunday.That apart, the only minor issue is the knee injury that meant Marcus Rashford missing the morning training drills and the autograph-signing session when, noticeably, Southgate stayed out a lot longer than any of his players. Rashford’s absence, however, was only a precautionary measure and the Manchester United forward will be fit for Monday’s game. Eric Dier is carrying a minor problem, with his left thigh strapped, but England are injury-free and controversy-free, rubbernecking in Spain’s direction after the sacking of Julen Lopetegui, and it has not needed long in Repino to get the impression that the players are being looked after impeccably behind the scenes.At Euro 2016 one complaint was that the air conditioning in the team’s Chantilly hotel was too fierce and, no kidding, the pillows too plump. Best of all, the chandeliers had to be removed from the £500-a-night Auberge du Jeu de Paume because the FA was so concerned they might be damaged if the players’ table-tennis tournaments got out of hand. These operations are always complicated because the players can be so high maintenance – Daniel Sturridge once asked if he could light joss sticks in his room – but there is a reason why the FA coddles and spoils them so much. For Southgate, it is about eliminating any possible excuses and creating a culture whereby everything is expected to run smoothly.That process has gone as far as the FA shipping luxury mattresses to help everyone get a good night’s sleep. The team hotel, the ForRestMix Club, already had blackout blinds to get around the fact it is still light here at 11pm, and light again from 3.30am, and when the players checked into their rooms they found that somebody from the FA had already been there and the walls were adorned with photographs of their families, children, wives and so on. No cuddly lions, though. England’s fluffy mascots – Kit, Cee and Leo – were given their own seats, and even had their own inflatable headrests, on the flight into France for Euro 2016. This time, there has been none of that silliness.As for the potential for boredom, Southgate has described that as a red herring and recalled how he was once told by a physio at Aston Villa that “only boring people complain of being bored”. Even so, it is a regular complaint in major tournaments and Jermain Defoe has spoken about it being such a problem at the 2010 World Cup that he and Wayne Rooney spent one afternoon together watching Rooney’s entire wedding video.Two days in, the only complaint from the players is that the live feed to watch Love Island on television apparently cut out on the first night. The FA has even put a bowling alley, a pool table and a darts board in the media centre, as well as an entertainment room at the team hotel. Plus there will be time set aside for the players to visit St Petersburg, where most of their families are staying.Southgate, for one, wants to spend some time in the city and, presumably, he will not make the same mistake as Roy Hodgson in Euro 2016, when the then England manager decided to go sightseeing in Paris, including a boat trip on the Seine with his assistant, Ray Lewington, rather than taking the opportunity to watch Iceland play Austria at the Stade de France. England’s game against Iceland came five days later and, well, you can probably remember what happened."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2b73bb03e4b0222f9d27f711c34cf4f2aaec335/0_163_4576_2746/master/4576.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aba3b201dedce76a7430d192927ec7df","title":"russia stanislav cherchesov world cup","story":"Stanislav Cherchesov smiled when asked by a Danish journalist whether he had a message for the Russian people on the eve of the opening match of a World Cup finals that is taking place in the largest country on the planet.“You would be hard pushed to get around the labyrinth of the Russian soul,” the Russia coach replied. “I think half the country will find out that we have a World Cup when the whistle blows. It takes a long time for us to start driving but I think when we press the foot on the pedal, we go all the way.”Russia, in other words, is not exactly gripped by World Cup fever in the way Brazil was four years ago, and the extent to which that mood shifts from apathy to excitement over the next couple of weeks is likely to hinge on whether the lowest-ranked team in the tournament can defy expectations and avoid the ignominy of being among the first to leave their own party.Hopes are not high in that respect. The front page of the Moscow Times, 24 hours before Russia face Saudi Arabia at the Luzhniki Stadium, provided a reasonable gauge of the mood in the country. “Ageing and inexperienced: why Russia is doomed to fail” ran the headline. “Destined for defeat” screamed the words above the article inside that lamented Russia’s failure to invest in a new youth programme once they were awarded the World Cup.The fact Cherchesov’s players are without a win in their past seven matches and have registered only one shot on target in 180 minutes has fuelled the inescapable sense of pessimism, with plenty of media commentators, as well as former players, describing the current generation as the worst Russia team ever.With all that in mind, Cherchesov could have been forgiven for walking into a packed media room in Moscow on Wednesday afternoon and looking like a rabbit staring into the headlights when the microphone was passed around the auditorium, yet nothing could have been further from the truth. The 54-year-old cracked jokes about James Bond and moustaches, revealed that his players had been relaxing by playing Trivial Pursuit and generally gave the impression that pressure was the last thing he was feeling.“I can tell you I don’t read anything,” Cherchesov said, when quizzed about the negative backdrop in Russia. “Getting criticism is a natural thing in the world that we live in today. But we never touch upon this topic at all. We have to do everything to earn praise and do everything we can to turn criticism into positive feedback.”That may be easier said than done, not least because there are clear signs that the Russia players are not as detached from the scathing media coverage as their manager.In Saudi Arabia, the next-lowest-ranked team in the World Cup, Russia could not have asked for more obliging opponents for their first game in a group that also features Egypt and Uruguay, yet few within the host nation are taking victory for granted. Serious injuries to Viktor Vasin, Georgy Dzhikiya and Alexander Kokorin have robbed Russia of three nailed-on starters and raised the possibility of Sergei Ignashevich, who effectively retired from international football two years ago and turns 39 the day before the final, starting in central defence against Saudi Arabia.Cherchesov, however, made Ignashevich’s belated return sound like it was all part of his grand plan. “As far as Ignashevich is concerned, I have the feeling that he never left us,” he said. “We kept track of him from day one, we reached an agreement with him and we kept our end of the bargain. He’s a cementing factor inside and outside of the pitch.”Whether that turns out to be the case against Saudi Arabia remains to be seen. The Saudis have not won a World Cup match since 1994, when Saeed al-Owairan ran half the length of the pitch to score a brilliant solo goal against Belgium, but recent results suggest that they can be awkward opponents. Managed by Juan Antonio Pizzi, a former Chile coach, Saudi Arabia lost only 2-1 against Italy at the end of last month and were narrowly beaten by Germany on Friday.An experiment in which nine Saudi players moved to Spain for the second half of the season to gain experience in a more competitive environment never worked, with few getting much game time, but this is the sort of stage – the opening match of a World Cup, in front of a huge global television audience – that should inspire Pizzi’s players. “We are ready, we are not afraid,” the former Spain international said. “Our goal is to beat\u0026nbspRussia.”The challenge for Russia, in contrast, is to galvanise a sceptical nation with the victory that would lift some of the gloom that has enveloped the team before a ball has been kicked and give everyone in this vast country a gentle nudge that the greatest sporting event of all is taking place on their doorstep."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68a8aca4583325f5ba40cebb2ad9cc4d620375af/0_105_6600_3960/master/6600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8eb930f64fa9c356631fcdb2f2a9be3","title":"world cup beauty russia vladimir putin","story":"Welcome, once again, to the world. Eight years, $19bn and two terms in the glorious 100-year rule of Vladimir Putin in the making, the 2018 World Cup in Russia is upon us. This has been a fittingly Soviet-scale construction project, taking in eight new superstadiums, thousands of miles of new roads and 53,000 civilian volunteers trained in the arts of pointing, waving and – toughest and most Russian of all – smiling at strangers.As ever the greatest show on earth carries its own irresistible heat before the tournament opener on Thursday afternoon. The World Cup may be compromised by greed and murkiness. Fifa may have become a kind of floating corporate city state, orbiting the globe, planting its great clanking tentacles down among the ripest pastures. But as preparations thrummed up through the gears in Moscow on Wednesday there was a familiar sense of clarity, of that background hum beginning to die away.It is one of football’s mysteries that no matter what its governing bodies throw at this great belching, burping circus, the spectacle at its heart somehow remains pure and impossibly more-ish. There will be the usual moments of beauty and outrage over the next 35 days and 64 matches. On Saturday afternoon Lionel Messi, the greatest footballer of the modern age, will take on an Iceland team managed by a part-time dentist.On Monday the odd-job street footballers of Panama will kick off their first ever World Cup, by the Black Sea. In Rostov the aristocrats of Brazil seek revenge for the humiliation of 2014 and for now the opening exchanges of any World Cup remain a four-yearly Christmas Day, an occasion that resonates with a deeply personal excitement.At which point, the world beyond must also come rushing in. Should Fifa’s simperingly insincere football family be here at all? When Russia’s players walk out to face Saudi Arabia on Thursday they will do so as emissaries of the world’s largest land mass, a nation with a long-standing football culture and with the will to put on a grand show.But still the question of Russia itself remains. There will be no shortage of pop-up Moscow expertise over the next few days, plenty of just-add-water holding forth on the exact scope and meaning of Putin’s sui generis superstate.This is not a criticism of attempts to put this spectacle in context, something everyone from Boris Johnson to Frankie Boyle (from whom this article has already stolen at least one Putin joke) has had a go at.What really stands out is the impossibility of the task, the basic dizzying oddity of Russia and a political system the writer Peter Pomerantsev has described as “a post-modern dictatorship”.A while back Gary Lineker offered a little handy moral relativism, floating the oft-repeated and deeply Russian notion that as there is corruption and murkiness in every country it is hypocritical to censure Russia for doing something similar.While this is true in one sense, it also eliminates at a stroke the question of degree, obscuring in Russia’s case the lack of political opposition – liberal Russians sometimes refer to the system as “a shitocracy” – or the fact Amnesty International has voiced concerns about violence against dissenting voices.Naturally the president was a visible presence in Moscow on the eve of the big kick-off, appearing suddenly on stage at the Fifa congress that would later award the United States, Mexico and Canada the 2026 tournament.As Putin took the microphone the World Cup trophy sat gleaming on its plinth a few yards away, a mirror image of smooth golden otherworldly alpha power. Relaxed as ever, with that strange capacity to fill any room with his presence, Russia’s leader spoke approvingly of Gianni Infantino – and without a false note right up until the moment he described Fifa’s president as “our front man”. Translation issues, no doubt.The view from Moscow is at least a little clearer. The grand beige-hued centre of town has been sandblasted by a two-year facelift project, leaving a spotless face to greet the World Cup’s half a million visitors. On Wednesday night travelling fans could already be seen singing in the central squares as Moscow submitted to World Cup fever like a sombre great-uncle dancing at a wedding.What happens next – if we can, finally, speak of the football – is equally fascinating. Among the favourites to win the World Cup, Brazil and Germany look strong and settled, and Spain strong and unsettled after the outlandish decision to sack their manager Julen Lopetegui on Wednesday morning, punishment for his acceptance of the Real Madrid job after the tournament.France have the greatest depth of talent. Argentina look brittle in defence and dreamily strong in attack, with Messi always capable of simply lifting the tournament by the scruff of the neck and walking away with it.Neutrals will perhaps hope for some new faces in the late stages. Nigeria, Senegal and Egypt carry Africa’s middling hopes of a first semi-finalist. Serbia may spring a shock, while Belgium, most people’s hotly tipped over-underdogs, have a look of England 2006 about them, with dollops of elite talent, a slightly jarring strain of optimism and a manager with a nice suit.Ah yes. England. For once football’s most quietly tortured nation will enter a World Cup with the burden of expectation close to zero. This has brought its own unexpected positivity. With an admirable manager in Gareth Southgate and some fit, likeable young players there has even been a cautious bubbling of optimism around the squad as they set about their drills in sleepy Repino.In the past England have relied on iniduals, on the notion a single burst of running power from some celebrity A-lister may be enough to roar the world into submission. This time they have a grooved system and a team of willing workers. A lack of outstanding players will do for them at some stage. But Southgate deserves credit for the way the tone has been set, for his backing of Raheem Sterling in the face of nonsensical assaults on his character and for the fraternal support offered to Danny Rose over his struggles with depression.And so on with the show. It is an odd side note to Russia 2018 that Putin wanted this World Cup for reasons that now seem a little distant. Ten years ago Russia was keen to engage with the world on positive terms, to signify its coming out as a global player. The temperature has dropped since, to the extent it is debatable Russia would bother bidding now.The greatest hope is the next five weeks, as Fifa flags decked with platitudes about friendship and family and anti-racism are unfurled around the Luzhniki Stadium, is that football may still provide something unexpected, a connection in some enduringly distant corners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd9b0086b181548bd323ca738abff8b831cd9a3b/0_210_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0aa9bb2d8930295ed85386d22b40d55","title":"how one marine lost his dream job but found meaning helping other veterans","story":"When a freak injury ended marine Nick Fleming’s chances of ever seeing active deployment, he left the services unsure of what to do next. But it wasn’t long before The Royal British Legion answered that question for himNick Fleming had always wanted to be a marine. After joining the service in February 2014, and enduring eight months of gruelling training, he was devastated when his career came to end because of a knee injury. The fact that it happened while on a rugby league pitch, rather than during deployment, added insult to injury. “It was my dream job,” he says. “To have it taken out from under my feet before it even got started was a pretty tough one to take.”The 28-year-old had been posted to Plymouth as part of the Royal Marines’ 42 Commando unit and would spend two years in rehabilitation, undergoing a number of operations to try and repair the damage. Eventually, under his surgeon’s advice, he had to admit defeat and accept that he wouldn’t be able to continue as a Royal Marine . He was medically discharged in October 2017 – only three and a half years after he’d joined the service. “One of the top knee surgeons in the south west said it was time to rethink my career. I potentially could have stayed on as a clerk or in the store, but it’s not really what I joined up to do. So it was decided I’d leave.” For service men and women who leave the forces, adjusting to civilian life can be a challenge. Fleming admits he didn’t really know what he wanted to do after he left the marines. “I had no clear direction,” he says, but decided to move to London to be with his girlfriend. He had come across The Royal British Legion while in rehabilitation, attending the charity’s Battle Back Centre in Lilleshall, which supports sick and injured armed forces personnel. While there, he took part in indoor climbing and golf sessions, and completed a wheelchair basketball coaching qualification. In London, he saw a job advert for an advice and information officer at the Legion’s Pop-In Centre and applied. He now helps others make the same transition as he did, and offers welfare support to the armed forces community as needed. Working in an office has been a real culture change, but he admits he’s found the work really rewarding. “We were able to talk to him, find him accommodation, get him a deposit and kit out the property. We gave him a fresh start and took that worry off him, so he could start getting his life back together.”Many of the charity’s beneficiaries are dealing with mental health issues, often related to their time in the services. Fleming has completed a mental health first aid course with the Legion to help those who come through the centre’s doors. The other common issue is accommodation – particularly in London. Some of the men and women leaving the service won’t have a plan in place for where they’re going to live afterwards and will panic about leaving it to the last minute. The Legion can help with finding somewhere suitable, offering grants for deposits or furnishings, or with filling out benefit forms. Fleming can also signpost beneficiaries to other services, such as counselling and physiotherapy. For him, the most challenging part of his work is learning to deal with the stress and responsibility of other people’s problems. Golf, which he was introduced to at the Battle Back Centre while in rehabilitation, has become an important coping mechanism.“Not only am I coming to terms with losing my career and moving to London, trying to find somewhere to live, all of that stuff, but you’re also picking up other people’s issues, which are constantly going through your mind,” he says. “Golf sounds really boring but if I need to unwind, that’s what I’ll go and do.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e781c19203bff7f6d1e09151cda434ef455ccdd/0_102_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86c9e6af0fe6731c26425d9b5c6befc1","title":"fox comcast buy offer latest rupert murdoch sale disney","story":"Cable giant Comcast has launched a hostile bid for 21st Century Fox, the media empire controlled by Rupert Murdoch.The $65bn bid, made on Wednesday afternoon, comes in a week of seismic change for the media industry. On Tuesday, a judge threw out US government objections to AT\u0026ampT’s takeover of Fox’s rival Time Warner.That decision had widely been interpreted as a signal that Comcast would make a play for Fox, which is currently negotiating a merger with Walt Disney.The reordering of the media landscape comes as cable, telecoms and media companies scramble to compete with tech companies including Amazon, Apple and Netflix, which are spending billions to develop their own empires.Five years from now there will be “three or four large, vertically integrated conglomerates with presence in wireline, wireless and content” competing with each other and the Silicon Valley giants, Barclays analysts said Wednesday.Advocacy group Free Press was quick to criticize the deal. “We simply don’t need the country’s biggest cable company and broadband provider controlling even more content and taking even more of our money every month,” said research director Derek Turner. “This merger will further strengthen Comcast’s hand, making it far more difficult for rivals to compete.”Comcast, which already owns NBCUniversal, is the US’s largest cable company and is likely to face regulatory scrutiny should Fox consider its bid.But on Tuesday, Judge Richard Leon threw out the justice department’s objections to AT\u0026ampT’s takeover of Time Warner. AT\u0026ampT is the US’s second largest mobile phone operator and also owns the satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV.The justice department, and Donald Trump, had argued the deal would concentrate too much power in one set of hands and that AT\u0026ampT could use the power of Time Warner’s content, which includes hit shows like HBO’s Game of Thrones and the Warner Brothers movie catalogue, to force rival carriers to pay higher prices that would be passed on to the consumer.But Leon rejected all of the government’s arguments in a stunning rebuttal to the justice department. Leon ruled it had failed to prove that the deal would suppress competition in the pay-TV industry.In a letter to Murdoch and his sons, Lachlan and James, Comcast’s chairman, Brian Roberts, wrote: “We have long admired what the Murdoch family has built at 21st Century Fox. After our meetings last year, we came away convinced that the 21CF businesses to be sold are highly complementary to ours, and that our company would be the right strategic home for them.”Roberts said he had been “disappointed” that Fox had entered into negotiations with Disney but was “highly confident” that his new offer would be approved by regulators.Fox is selling its famous film studio, networks National Geographic and FX, its stake in British satellite TV business Sky and Asian pay-TV operator Star TV, among other assets. Comcast made a bid for all of Sky in April and will pursue both mergers simultaneously.Murdoch’s decision to sell will leave the family with a far smaller media business consisting of Fox News and sports channels and its news media business, which includes the Wall Street Journal, the Times and the Sun.The surprise decision was announced last December. “Are we retreating? Absolutely not,” said Rupert Murdoch in a conference call. “Those who know me know I am a news man with a competitive spirit. Fox News is probably the strongest brand in all of television. We are pivoting at a pivotal moment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bf93034ea01b27c6924ca685fd17f061175d762/0_0_2772_1664/master/2772.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bd291d59c5257dcbac763c0fcf88f5b","title":"whatsapp popular for sharing news minus the toxic debates","story":"The public is increasingly forgoing Facebook as a news source and using WhatsApp to share and discuss stories with friends and family, according to a new report on the state of the media.“Consumers are being put off by ‘toxic’ debates and unreliable news. They are also finding that alternative networks offer more convenience, greater privacy and less opportunity to be misunderstood. As a result they are moving discussion to messaging apps where they can be sure they are talking to ‘real friends’,” says the report from the University of Oxford’s Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.Many publishers have noted a growing importance afforded private WhatsApp groups for distributing news and information.This change raises enormous challenges for news outlets and fact checkers, since the service is encrypted and it is almost impossible to monitor how articles are being shared and correct any spread of misinformation.It could also prove to be another regulatory headache for Facebook, since Mark Zuckerberg’s company also owns WhatsApp in addition to its flagship social network.The seventh annual Digital News Report, from the University of Oxford’s Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, which is based an online YouGov survey of 74,000 people in 37 countries, show substantial changes in the news landscape over the last year. The fallout from the 2016 US presidential election has continued to affect the actions of social media businesses and consumers.The report found that use of WhatsApp for news has almost tripled since 2014 and overtaken Twitter in importance in many countries, especially among younger users. In some countries, such as Malaysia and Turkey, the encryption makes it a far safer place than Facebook for iniduals wanting to discuss political issues without attracting the attention of the authorities.Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, a professor and one of the report’s editors, said the public still tended to blame news publishers rather than social networks for the “long-standing crisis of confidence” in the media industry. “Much of the public does not feel it can trust the news, especially in countries with highly polarised politics and where many media are vulnerable to undue economic or political influence,” he said.The Reuters Institute research concluded that British media consumption was still dominated by BBC News, although the  website was the second most popular online news website, just ahead of MailOnline.It also found growing awareness in the UK for niche campaigning left-wing websites supportive of Jeremy Corbyn, such as The Canary, and Another Angry Voice, but warned that changes to Facebook’s algorithm “could see these alternative websites struggle to retain attention”. The social network is known to be refining its algorithm to take greater account of how much users trust various news sites.Most of the respondents to the survey erroneously believed that the majority of online news outlets made money. However, the survey found readers were much more likely to pay for a news subscription or give a donation if they were an informed that an outlet needed the income to cover costs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50438ef15c5ff956fe8301b785ba7bd938bc3c0a/1137_1245_3657_2194/master/3657.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be59e4f2439e4b92b754f344f606a777","title":"female composers largely ignored by concert line ups","story":"Women in Music project finds that in 1,445 classical concerts across globe only 76 include a work by a womanNew statistics have shown up the “inexcusable” fact that only 76 classical concerts among 1,445 performed across the world from this year to 2019 include at least one piece by a woman. The composer Emily Hall, who called the result of the tot-up inexcusable, said: “All organisations have a responsibility to programme at least one work by a female composer, I just think that should be standard now. I’m always shocked when I go to a concert and they don’t, it seems such a straightforward thing to do ... I’m always amazed, it seems like such a huge oversight.”The soprano Gabriella Di Laccio said she was shocked by the research. “I don’t really understand it, we don’t have excuses any more. The idea that there might not be enough female composers or the music might not be good enough ... this is all in the past.”Campaigners say the old arguments about the canon being overwhelmingly male do not stand up. Di Laccio created the Donne project this year to champion female composers and highlight women whose music often went unrecognised in their lifetime. She said the project had convinced her that there were more than enough female composers in history to get a fairer gender balance at concerts.She thought part of the solution could come from audiences being more questioning about the music orchestras presented. “The whole idea of doing this is not to make people angry but to raise awareness. I hope this will be a gentle wake-up call.”Hall said she was in favour of positive discrimination. “It works, it really does. We need to rebalance the scales.”She recalled encountering lots of “unconscious barriers” in her career and remembered her music education being all about middle-aged men. “It has taken me until now to actually conduct my own music because I had always felt like I shouldn’t be doing that on some subconscious level. We need to make it completely equal for the next generation.”Some organisations have introduced measures to address the issue. The BBC Proms and the Aldeburgh Festival, for example, have pledged a 5050 gender balance in commissions of contemporary composers by 2022.The Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music \u0026amp Dance announced a commitment to female composers, entitled Venus Blazing, which it said it hoped would abolish all-male composer programmes. It said music by women, past and present and across genres, would make up more than half of its concert programmes in 201819.Di Laccio said orchestras should be playing the great works by composers such as Beethoven and Mozart but that did not excuse them from ignoring so many female composers.The project Donne and the independent label Drama Musica gathered the data for the figures from the 2018-19 programmes of 15 large orchestras across the world, including the London Philharmonic Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and Los Angeles Philharmonic.The LSO’s managing director, Kathryn McDowell, said the orchestra championed the work of women. “Of the 12 young composers on our programmes this season six are women, and while entry to them is based purely on merit, we have seen a 5050 gender split emerge for the past two years, signalling that the best composers writing in Britain today are just as likely to be women as they are men, which is exactly as it should be.”Timothy Walker, chief executive and artistic director of the LPO, said the orchestra did “not make artistic choices based on issues of gender, religion or ethnicity” but was “strongly committed to supporting female musicians and composers”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25fff606cae5537c97fc2a76a720bff0bf19bbc8/0_0_3500_2335/master/3500.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97182754439fe62b3825f32a04377d2f 700w","title":"labour jeremy corbyn backbench revolt 75 mps brexit vote","story":"Labour isions show as one front bencher and five aides resign from shadow cabinetJeremy Corbyn has suffered his biggest backbench revolt since he became leader as Labour’s isions on Europe broke out into the open once more. In an extraordinary breakdown of party discipline, more than half of his backbenchers defied the party whip.In a vote on a Lords amendment that would effectively mean staying in the European Economic Area, 75 backbenchers defied party instructions to abstain and voted for the EEA. A further 15, also defying the party whip, voted against.In a week at Westminster that has been dominated by the sense that the Brexit debate and the UK’s future relations with the EU are approaching a crisis, many Labour MPs were frustrated at the frontbench attempt to fudge away party differences. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said on Monday night that the party was too ided to pursue the so-called Norway option of EEA membership.But rebelling on the bill for the first time on Wednesday evening, Hilary Benn, the former shadow foreign secretary, who chairs the Commons cross-party Brexit committee, said there comes a point where “we have to stand up and be counted”.He said that remaining in the EEA, which includes membership of the single market, was not a perfect solution. But it was better than all the others. Pointing out that the other options proposed by the government and by Labour were only untested proposals, Benn said the EEA was an established alternative to EU membership.“It has the one great advantage – it at least looks like a lifeboat. And the closer we get to October, the less inviting the cold sea appears.”One frontbencher and five parliamentary aides resigned from the shadow cabinet ahead of the vote: the junior shadow cabinet office minister Laura Smith and the parliamentary private secretaries Ged Killen, Ellie Reeves, Tonia Antoniazzi, Anna McMorrin and Rosie Duffield. Illustrating the isions in the party, Smith resigned in order to vote against the EEA. She has a majority of just 48 in her leave-voting Crewe and Nantwich seat. Meanwhile Duffield (who won the seat of Canterbury in 2017’s most shocking result), resigned in order to back EEA membership.But whips were relieved that there were not more rebels. A week ago reports of as many as 120 were being touted, while this week’s New Statesman reports that the leading Labour remainer Chuka Umunna has been talking openly of starting a new party, Back Together. One rebel claimed the result suggested that there would be a majority for an EEA-type amendment to either the trade bill or the customs bill, both of which will be back in the Commons in the next few weeks. With three Tory MPs voting for the EEA amendment and eight abstaining, there is already a core of Conservative dissidents and a customs union amendment is gathering cross-party support.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, anticipating the revolt, admitted in a speech on Wednesday morning that the party was on a tightrope. “We campaigned for remain but many of our MPs, including myself, now represent seats which voted heavily leave.“We are trying to construct at the moment a traditional British compromise and we are trying to drag as many with us as possible both in government and elsewhere around some key elements of that compromise.”Caroline Flint, a Labour remainer whose Don Valley constituency voted more than two to one to leave, defended her constituents, who she said had been insulted “day in and day out by some of the comments in this place and outside” stressing that they “are not against all migration”.Flint said she could not support EEA membership because it would mean there would be no restriction on free movement.She said her constituents “want to have a sense that we can turn the tap on and off when we choose. “But also they want us to answer the question, why hasn’t Britain got the workforce it needs, why has social mobility stopped, why do we train fewer doctors than Holland or Ireland and why are these jobs dominated by those in the middle and upper classes so my constituents don’t get a look in?”But the former Europe minister Pat McFadden said it would be “unwise and rash” to take the EEA, the one viable alternative to a Tory deal on Brexit, or no deal at all, off the table. Backing the Lords amendment, he said “We need to address working class discontent but we do not take the first step to doing that by making the country poorer, to not get the wealth for public services, for housing, and for the better chance in life our working classes deserve.”Yvette Cooper, the former shadow home secretary who now chairs the home affairs select committee said she would obey the party whip and not vote for membership of the EEA only because she wanted to try to build consensus.Cooper and Benn had introduced an amendment calling for EEA “with safeguards”. She said her committee had heard evidence about the measures other EU member states were applying to introduce some control over migration, which she had been told could be a way of the UK having full single market access without complete free movement. A spokesman for Corbyn said: “The Labour Party respects the outcome of the EU referendum and does not support the EEA or Norway model as it is not the right option for Britain.”The debate exposed how two years after the referendum, Labour is still profoundly ided over the best way to respond to the anxieties it revealed. While talk of a new party might be partly discounted by business managers as the result of too many warm summer evenings on the Commons terrace, both sides will be aware of how 40 years ago the long debate over whether or not to join the Common Market as it then was, also dissolved traditional party loyalties. Ultimately it led to the fracturing of the Labour party and the breakaway Social Democratic party – and more than 20 years in opposition."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/457fb69e6e8bcd7a770183d23d8a89ea3395579a/65_0_1773_1064/master/1773.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5066096278b57a377c6c2c8833d1a73c","title":"snp gifts may a hissy fit to take her out of the limelight at pmqs","story":"Better still for the PM, she got to field questions from Brexit ultras and not testy Scots Nats It was one way of getting noticed. For a while now the SNP have been feeling rather peripheral to the main events in Westminster. Unloved, unrecognised, unwanted. An afterthought at best. Much the same way the prime minister must feel when she goes to meetings of the G5 + 1 + 1 and the European council.After parliament had been given just 19 minutes the day before to debate the impact of Brexit on the devolved governments, Ian Blackford decided enough was enough at prime minister’s questions. Rather than bothering to ask Theresa May a question she wasn’t going to answer, the SNP leader chose to invoke an arcane piece of procedure to demand an immediate vote in private on the government’s handling of Scottish constitutional affairs. For the first time in his parliamentary career, Blackford had the Commons’ unided attention.Cue chaos. The Speaker was blindsided and didn’t appear to know whether he was obliged to halt PMQs and call a vote immediately or delay it till the end of the session. After some hesitation, John Bercow advised Blackford to wait until PMQs were over. Blackford remained on his feet, insisting the session be interrupted for his meaningless meaningless vote. As a change from a meaningless meaningful vote if nothing else.With the noise levels rising and sensing he was about to lose control of the chamber, the Speaker ordered the SNP leader in Westminster to leave the chamber for the rest of the day. Blackford punched the air. Job done. The vote in private had always been secondary to the stunt in public. Now he couldn’t be ignored. Even if only for a matter of minutes.As Blackford waddled – he tried to stomp, but was just a bit too self-conscious – out of the chamber, the other 34 SNP MPs rose to leave with him. Joanna Cherry gestured angrily towards the Speaker. Mhairi Black jabbed her finger and looked ready to take on all comers – “come and get me if you think you’re hard enough” – as Tory backbenchers heckled and jeered the Scots Nats on their way out.The walkout might have been right up there in futility with the Lib Dem hissy-fit of 2008 – over an EU referendum, of all things – but the long-term fallout may be more damaging. The sight of several hundred entitled Tory backbenchers making it clear they don’t give a toss about anyone in Scotland is not going to play out well north of the border. When it comes to the Union, the Tories couldn’t have made it clearer that it’s England first.The disruption did work to one person’s advantage though. For a few minutes everyone forgot about the prime minister. There’s only one reasonable explanation left for how Theresa May can continue to function. And that is that she goes to bed each night hoping everyone will forget how badly she’s screwed up the day before and that she can start afresh in an altered reality. One where she never called the election. Where Britain never voted to leave the EU. And preferably where she isn’t prime minister.For the fourth consecutive week, Jeremy Corbyn chose to exploit the government’s isions and confusion over Brexit, though with less success than before. Not because May was any better prepared, but because her uselessness has now been factored in to the equation. No one now expects her to say anything coherent – or even credible – and provided she doesn’t fall over or inadvertently crash her circuit boards, her minders rate her performance as a triumph.Better still for May, the mass walkout meant she didn’t have to face tricky questions from the four Scots Nats who had been tabled to speak. Instead the hardline Brexiters Jacob Rees-Mogg and Philip Davies got to press her on whether she was going to offer concessions to the Tory rebels who forgot to rebel or stick with offering a meaningless meaningful vote.May happily reassured them. She is now so far gone with Stockholm syndrome she can’t prevent herself from saying anything she thinks her captors want to hear. Whether she meant what she said, not even she really knows. It was just beginning to dawn on Dominic Grieve that he might have been outwitted by someone far dimmer and less capable than him.To round off one of the more extraordinary PMQs, Labour’s Frank Field spent the entire session sitting on the Tory front bench. He has appeared for a while to be angling for a transfer. Now he’s got his wish. If several more Tory ministers resign over Brexit, he could be in the cabinet by this time next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf97727faa060268ce134b7343b21aecede59d8/186_0_1667_1000/master/1667.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3faaf0732dc72b9e0f95f8249c2ca060","title":"mars storm nasa rover opportunity","story":"Experts have no idea what the landscape, or the Opportunity, will look like after storm raging across a quarter of the planet Nasa’s Mars rover Opportunity has been knocked out by a gigantic dust storm that is enveloping the red planet and blotting out the sun.Officials said on Wednesday they were hopeful the rover would survive the storm, which already covers a quarter of Mars and is expected to encircle the planet in another few days. It could be weeks, or even months, until the sky clears enough for sunlight to reach the surface and recharge Opportunity’s batteries through its solar panels.For now, Mars’ oldest working rover is stuck in the middle of the raging storm, in round-the-clock darkness.“By no means are we out of the woods here,” said John Callas, the Opportunity project manager at Nasa’s jet propulsion laboratory in Pasadena, California. “This storm is threatening, and we don’t know how long it will last, and we don’t know what the environment will be like once it clears.”Flight controllers tried late on Tuesday night to contact Opportunity, but the rover did not respond. The storm has been growing since the end of May with unprecedented speed.Nasa launched the twin rovers Opportunity and Spirit in 2003 to study Martian rocks and soil. They landed in 2004. Spirit hasn’t worked for several years. Opportunity, however, has kept exploring well past its expected mission lifetime.Scientists are not concerned about the newer, nuclear-powered Curiosity rover, which is on the other side of Mars where skies are beginning to darken.Dust storms, which occur from time to time on Mars, send dust tens of kilometres into the atmosphere and turn day into night. Spacecraft orbiting Mars are too high to be affected.The Opportunity is unlikely to be buried or get a wheel stuck in dust. Even in the worst of storms, only a layer of fine dust is left behind. Managers said the main concern is that dust could temporarily cover its optical instruments.The rover’s batteries are likely so low that only a clock is still working, to wake the spacecraft for periodic power-level checks, according to officials. If the clock also goes offline, then the rover won’t know what time it is when it comes back on and could send back signals at any time.This isn’t Opportunity’s first major brush with dust.In 2007, a massive dust storm kept Opportunity silent for a few days. It jumped back into action after awakening from its deep self-protecting slumber.This time, the rover’s energy level is believed to be much lower. However, Martian summertime is approaching, which should keep temperatures up at night and prevent the batteries and other parts freezing. Besides electrical heaters, Opportunity is equipped with eight tiny plutonium-powered heaters.Scientists are eager to learn as much as they can about the dust storm to hone their weather forecasting skills. Astronauts living on Mars, for instance, would struggle if caught outside in a fierce dust storm, where winds can reach 113kph (70mph). Opportunity was in remarkably good health going into the storm, Callas said, with only an arthritic joint in its robotic arm. “Keep in mind, we’re talking about a rover that’s been working at Mars, hanging in there, for 15 years and designed just for 90 days,” said Jim Watzin, director of Nasa’s Mars exploration program. “It just doesn’t get any better than that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77c66117ce13c2e4903d2161b5343ab41b371368/200_0_4083_2449/master/4083.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3808558d87bc4daba91acd248f7f1569","title":"christina nielsen le mans 24 hours","story":"Porsche’s selected driver is following in her father’s wake and this weekend will be competing for the third time at La SartheCasual observers of this year’s Le Mans 24 Hours might be forgiven for believing that despite boasting a grid of 60 cars, encompassing 180 drivers, the meeting concerns but two.Inevitably it is Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button who have caused the furore as the two former Formula One world champions attempt to add winning the world’s greatest grand prix d’endurance to their CVs. Yet, as always, this magnificent event is so much more and for Denmark’s Christina Nielsen, racing at Le Mans is almost a family affair.Nielsen is competing for the third time at Circuit de la Sarthe, having already blazed a trail with a hugely successful career. She competes for the Ebimotors team in the GTE-AM class in a Porsche 911 RSR. Porsche are the race’s most successful manufacturer with 19 overall wins and have chosen Nielsen as the first woman with whom they have an official association, with the title of Porsche selected driver.For the 26-year-old it is honour and pleasure. Her father, Lars Erik Nielsen, drove a Porsche in four of his five runs at Le Mans between 2004 and 2008. In 2007 Nielsen attended the race to watch him when she was 15. This time he will be at the track to watch her.Her ambition was rewarded in 2016 when she became the first woman to win the IMSA sportscar championship in the US in the GT Daytona class and remarkably repeated the feat the following year. The class is hugely competitive, as it will be at Le Mans, but the close racing is the attraction for Nielsen.It was Denmark’s Tom Kristensen who really put the race on the map in their home country, becoming the most successful driver at Le Mans with nine wins, but Nielsen too has made her mark and is putting it to good use. She is active in the Danish Women’s Society. “Our common goal in the organisation is to promote equality,” she explains. “So in a sport like racing, where men and women compete equally, to have those results to back me up is really important.”She has the credentials then but others still have lessons to be learned and there is some exasperation already at Le Mans. “I get annoyed when I am in a drivers’ briefing and the race director for the third year in a row continues to say: ‘Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.’ Instead of ladies and gentlemen, or he could just say ‘drivers’. I picked them up on it for the last two years but this year I didn’t because it didn’t change, so all I can do is go out and do my thing on the race track.”When Nielsen does, she knows she will not be the centre of attention and this week it has been impossible to ignore Alonso and Button. However, another former Porsche driver, Derek Bell, who won four of his five race victories for them, remembered gloriously in his new book, All My Porsche Races, believes the same principles for success apply across the grid when drivers share the car for 24 hours.“You have to work as a team,” says Bell. “You have to have total respect for your team-mates. The important thing was sitting in the car and saying: ‘We can win this bastard.’ And you have confidence your team-mates agree.”Bell drove with the great Jacky Ickx for three of his five wins, a formidable pairing indeed, but good team-mates are only part of the story. The 8.46‑mile La Sarthe circuit has unique demands but drivers must also cope with the volume of traffic and the high closing speeds between classes – all skills Nielsen possesses but ones that Alonso and Button must learn in short order.“They both have enough brains but you have to be able to analyse,” Bell says. “You mustn’t look at every gap and think it is a chance to go past and win. You have to think: ‘Will I benefit, or will it bugger up my lap?’”He is optimistic, however, that both have what it takes to prove themselves at the first attempt on the 24. “Fernando will adapt very quickly as he has been in the car already and Jenson will adapt because he knows what he has to do to win,” he says. “It’s more of a thinking race than F1 or any other.”Nielsen know all this already and brings a professional detachment to the maelstrom around the superstars. “It’s great that they are part of making it a success,” she says. “But once they are behind the wheel they are just like everyone else.”For her it is an event greater than any inidual, no matter their fame. “Le Mans is so much bigger than anything else,” she says. “Every driver leaves with the same feeling: that I hope I can be back here next year – another 364 days and I can’t wait.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48aa692da828a279153420a85df919999271a1a3/0_247_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26022aabc9d7f2c4911640a34db55b15","title":"england australia first odi report","story":"England won the first one-day international against Australia by three wickets. But they did so messily, in a manner hardly befitting the side ranked No\u0026nbsp1 in the world. Had they lost this match England would have lost their position at the top of the ICC’s one-day perch and no one could have quibbled about that. The Australians were tigerish in the field but they were defending an inadequate total. Too often England’s batsmen were wanton, as if taking the win for granted. It may be time for a word from those in charge – an “honest discussion” is the modern description.The Australians behaved impeccably but they did not bat very well. With the exception of Glenn Maxwell their batsmen succumbed meekly against the bowling attack hammered by the Scots four days earlier. England’s spinners, Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, did most of the damage, sharing five wickets as Australia were bowled out for 214.That total could have been worse. In fact it was one more run than Australia scored in arguably the greatest 50-over game of all, the semi-final of the 1999 World Cup at Edgbaston when the match was tied, which allowed Steve Waugh’s side to progress to the final rather than South Africa. On that occasion the bowlers who prevailed in a low-scoring match were Shaun Pollock, Allan Donald and Shane Warne.That calibre of bowler was not on view here and the game has changed a lot since then. A total of 214 has become a paltry one in 50-over cricket, one which makes thousands of punters feel slightly betrayed at the absence of a contest. And it appears that for too many of England’s batsmen it is not a target that warrants serious consideration. Only Joe Root and Eoin Morgan appeared to take the contrary view that this was a task, however menial, that required some application.The ticket touts were out in force outside Oval tube station beforehand but the value for money was better in Edinburgh. Most of the fans were in place in time for the crucial handshakes just before the start of play. At least the players did not hang around too long when performing this gesture. It did not take 12 seconds for all of them to get this odd ritual out of the way.Once the game started David Willey did not have to work too hard for the initial breakthrough. A very wide swinging half volley was edged by Travis Head and the ball ballooned gently to Jonny Bairstow at first slip. Thereafter 40 easy runs were crunched against the pacemen and there was the expectation of a runfest from Aaron Finch and Shaun Marsh. Both looked in fine fettle until the introduction of Moeen.Morgan gave his off-spinner the ninth over, which can be a teaser for the batsmen. It was a worthwhile ploy. In his first over Finch was trying to drive with an inside-out swing of the bat in pursuit of a boundary but the outcome was only a gentle catch to backward point. Marsh soon fell in a more classical manner as the ball turned sufficiently to beat his outside edge.Moeen’s third wicket was the Australia captain, Tim Paine. The bowler removed his first slip so to the next delivery Paine opted to reverse sweep instead of mischievously trickling through the vacant slip area the ball ended up in the hands of Mark Wood at backward point. So Australia were stumbling at 70 for four, which soon became 90 for five when Marcus Stoinis was caught behind, trying to cut a delivery from Rashid, who had embarked on one of his more frugal spells for England.Maxwell, with discreet support from Ashton Agar, forged a minor recovery, the pair adding 84 in 17 overs. Even Maxwell recognised a grave situation and reined himself in, though he did treat himself to 14 runs from Moeen’s final over, hitting an effortless six over mid-off with the ease of a golfer who had decided to give the ball a hint of fade. But on 62 he was caught on the square-leg boundary by Bairstow and the chances of Australia posting a decent target disappeared.The blasters at the top of the order had all disappeared within eight overs when England took to the crease. Jason Roy was bowled off the inside edge by the second delivery he faced from the beanpole Billy Stanlake Alex Hales was lbw to Michael Neser. Bairstow hit six boundaries, five of them racing from the middle of his bat, to confirm that he is in princely form, but he could not capitalise. A pull shot fizzed from his bat straight into the hands of Head on the rope at square leg.Morgan and Root managed to restore the situation with no apparent difficulty, with the white-ball captain scoring faster and striking the boundaries. Meanwhile Root was content to bat with restraint, a rare event in this England side. Then there was another surprising flurry of wickets. Morgan was caught behind off the cunning Andrew Tye, whose pace variations caused considerable confusion.Jos Buttler’s mind seemed elsewhere he was off the mark with a lofted drive a top-edged catch was dropped by Paine and then he was duped by Tye’s knuckle ball and caught at mid-on. In the next over Root was caught behind off Stanlake with 52 runs still required. Moeen holed out to square leg. But Willey, forsaking the notion of getting ’em in singles, swatted enough boundaries to see a relieved England home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40d5117a268c0ec5178f5d9ed1cc76815fbdcbdc/0_380_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d5584ecbe541e1982f62f47e1709ace","title":"parklife britains green spaces in urban places","story":"Spending time outdoors in nature has a hugely positive effect on our wellbeing, but you don’t have to live in a rural area to experience the benefits. Kevin Rushby shares some of his favourite city parks, heaths, wetlands and gardens The only British city to ever win the European Green Capital award (for 2015), Bristol is an urban park-lover’s paradise. Close to the centre is Castle Park, a garden with ruins that is linked across the river by the elegant Castle footbridge. There’s a good five-mile walk to be had along the river, linking gardens and the docks, including Brandon Hill Park. Climb the 30-metre-tall (105ft) Cabot Tower for a fine city view. Scattered all around the city are some great parks worthy of cycle adventures. To the south there is Victoria Park, presided over by the colourful terraced houses of St Luke’s Crescent. Nearby, a real gem is Arnos Vale Victorian cemetery, 18 hectares (45 acres) of greenery where, with luck, you can spot woodpeckers, deer and even slow worms basking on tombstones.Arriving at Glasgow Central, you might be forgiven for wondering where all the green spaces might be, given the extent to which the city’s formidable architecture dominates. Dotted around, however, are some magnificent spots: a top place to go is Kelvingrove, a park with everything for a day out – cafes (try An Clachan), a brilliant museum, monuments, and fountains (the Stewart is a good meeting point). Heading east, check out the Necropolis, last resting place of Victorian grandees. Southwards, the gem is Pollok country park, a lovely day out, even though the unparalleled Burrell Collection is currently closed (till 2020). In the west are the Botanic Gardens, with their fascinating hothouse collection.Given London property prices, you might reasonably expect the city’s green spaces to shrink, not grow. But there have been recent additions, notably Walthamstow Wetlands, a huge area of lakes with 13 miles of trails just a few minutes’ walk from Tottenham Hale station. There is great birdwatching, fishing, cycling and a decent cafe, the Engine House. Also new are the Woodberry Wetlands, a green space that had existed since 1833, but only opened to the public in 2013. Right beside Finsbury Park, it is a good inner-city birding site: you can spot red kites and even marsh harriers. Not exactly new, but renewed, is Burgess Park off the Old Kent Road in Southwark, which recently had an £8m facelift, introducing a bigger lake, new bridge and play areas. Downriver from Greenwich, there are fascinating brownfield parks.The Black Country, if you didn’t know, is actually green: Birmingham has hundreds of parks, many of them vast. Kingfisher country park, for example, runs for 11km along the river Cole, while Cannon Hill Park covers around 100 hectares (250 acres). Within that space you have lakes, tennis, golf, playgrounds, running trails and tearooms – this place really can do a full family day out. If you believe that any great park must be in search of a stately home, then try Aston Park – it has a magnificent Jacobean palace. All the above, however, are dwarfed by Sutton Park, a 970-hectare (2,400-acre) national nature reserve six miles north of the centre, which boasts 22 species of butterfly, plus a few rarities. Look out for the startling Camberwell Beauty – unseen since 1996.Holyrood Park certainly has the size (263 hectares650 acres) and the eye-catching eminence of Arthur’s Seat, but this former royal hunting park also leads through to the less well-known Dr Neil’s Garden, a lovely area created by two local GPs who used caravan holidays in Europe as plant-hunting expeditions. Other off-the-beaten track green spaces in Edinburgh include the Archivists’ Garden, one of several small city gardens tucked away from the busy streets. Also check out Dunbar’s Close, a 17th-century garden, and the roof garden at the National Museum of Scotland. About a mile north from the centre is Inverleith Park, which neighbours the magnificent Royal Botanic Garden.Few cities can boast a green space like Cardiff’s Bute Park, a vast expanse of woodland, grass, trails and playgrounds close to the city centre. Its true magic, however, is that it connects, all along the banks of the river Taff, to several other parks: across the Millennium footbridge check out Sophia Gardens – home to Glamorgan Cricket Club, plus cycle hire, horse-riding centre and cafes – then various meadows, parks and gardens all the way north to the M4. Forest Farm country park is worth a visit: the footpath along the old Glamorganshire canal is rich in birdlife, including kingfishers. Also right in the heart of the city is another, much smaller, green space: the Victorian roof garden on top of the Bute Tower in Cardiff Castle.Green may not be the first colour that pops into your mind when thinking of Liverpool, but the city is blessed with great parks. Stanley Park, a classic Victorian creation, separates the Reds and the Blues – the two football grounds of Anfield and Goodison Park. There’s a good cafe in the Isla Gladstone conservatory, plus fishing lake, playground and a red sandstone wall that inspired the Redwall series of children’s books by Brian Jacques. On the other side of the city, check out Sefton Park and Calderstones. From the latter you could walk the mile to another green space: St Peter’s church, Woolton, scene of arguably the most important musical moment in the 20th century: the first public performance by Lennon and McCartney. Also in this quiet churchyard is the gravestone that inspired the Beatles’ Eleanor Rigby."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2404420d866665b1942db16f281177773a2a0964/0_80_3429_2058/master/3429.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b96ec3969d9d6678d514251589202a2b","title":"eu member states block uks access to galileo satellite programme after brexit","story":"Fears over impact on Brexit talks with UK taxpayers having already contributed £1bn A fresh row over the UK’s involvement with the Galileo satellite programme, to which the country’s taxpayers have already paid £1bn, threatens to poison the Brexit talks after the EU shut Britain out of the project.A majority of member states have turned against the UK and voted in favour of pushing forward on the next round of contracts for the £8bn project, despite requests for a delay to allow negotiations over British involvement to progress. UK firms are being blocked from bidding for contracts.Galileo is an £8bn satellite navigation system intended to rival the US-controlled global positioning system. Once fully operational in 2020 it will provide accurate position, navigation and timing information to be used by governments, citizens, industry and the military.British companies have been central to its design and build. A technical paper handed to EU negotiators last month warned that restricting UK involvement would lead to delays of up to three years and an additional cost to the EU of about €1bn. .The result prompted a furious response from the UK science minister, Sam Gyimah, who repeated the claim that Britain was willing to “walk away” from the project, to develop a rival satellite. The UK was beaten by a “simple majority” within the 28 member states.Gyimah said: “The government has been clear that our preference is to contribute fully to Galileo as part of a deep security partnership with the EU, and that negotiations should be allowed to run their course. By forcing through this vote, while excluding UK companies from the contracts on unfounded security grounds, the European Commission has put this at risk. “There is an option on the table that would benefit both the UK and EU. If that is not accepted by the EU, we are a proud and confident nation and will be looking at all alternatives.”The development came 24 hours after European commission officials secured support from the 27 member states for their decision to treat the UK like any other non-EU country, despite concerns among some at the high-handed approach of its officials on the issue. France, the UK’s closest security partner in the EU, which is particularly keen for tight cooperation in the future, backed Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator.A commission slide presentation to the member states was made public on Wednesday that dismissed British demands as seeking to go beyond what is possible for third countries.The document insisted that the EU’s guiding philosophy was that a country withdrawing from the union could not enjoy the same benefits as a member state.Stefaan de Rynck, an aide to Barnier, tweeted on their publication: “As @MichelBarnier said in a speech on 14 May, ‘we need to put the cooperation on Galileo between the EU and the UK on a new basis’”. The development is likely to infect the wider negotiations. The UK has warned of irreparable damage to security cooperation should the EU insist on blocking its requests for a status on the project similar to that enjoyed today.Yet this week’s commission paper claims the UK is seeking a “change of nature” of the programme, turning it into an international endeavour rather than a purely EU one.There would be a loss of “strategic autonomy” for the bloc if it gave way to the UK’s calls for equal access to the design and development of the secure military-grade signal as the EU, the commission successfully argued.It was further agreed that the UK government could instead only have “observer status” on decisions relating to the project. Its space industry will also not be permitted the same access to contracts for security elements of the satellite system as member states.EU diplomats were quick to point out that the commission is not blocking the UK’s military from access to Galileo’s secure signal, just proprietary knowledge of its codes, design and development. In restricted circumstances, UK companies could also manufacture the receivers for the military-grade signal. But the commission managed to get agreement that the UK would not be offered a special status, a position that Downing Street claims would not be strong enough for it to put its faith in the satellite when its military was engaged in a conflict zone.EU officials have previously suggested that offering the UK access to Galileo’s secure components and development would give Downing Street the power to switch the satellite off.A UK government source said: “The suggestion the UK could ‘switch off the system’ is absurd fearmongering which ignores the strength of UK support for Europe’s security, our shared aims in Nato, and our common interests.“It implies they wish to treat us as a hostile state, which is frankly laughable. Of course, if they really are worried about it we could easily provide safeguards on that point in the terms of our access.”Last month the chancellor, Philip Hammond, warned that the UK would “have to go it alone”, if the EU maintained their position.The UK has also threatened to seek the return of its past financial contributions. Such a move would imperil the wider withdrawal agreement by opening up the sensitive matter of the country’s £39bn orce bill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8814426e64d7e8d61126b17faa606256be9d87a0/0_24_2769_1662/master/2769.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2464e60659b4da0befc01b8a7f679204","title":"putins russia with david dimbleby review things are different there","story":"On a mission to take the temperature of the host nation before the World Cup, the broadcaster discovers plenty of opposition to Putin – but also admirationDavid Dimbleby’s in Russia. For the Tunisia game? Ingerland, Ingerland, Ingerland … I can’t quite see it, though that is sort of why he is here: to find out what kind of Russia football fans are coming to. There are other reasons to be interested in Russia right now, of course. Not least: THE NEW COLD WAR.Dimbleby was here 25 years ago, talking to Boris Yeltsin. “Are you no longer targeting British citizens?” a younger Dimbleby asked the then president. No presidential audience this time. No opportunity to ask the man – who, after 18 years in charge, is looking more settled and established than ever – the same. Who are you targeting, Vlad? Anyone, for example, in the Salisbury area? Foreign elections, perhaps?Instead, Dimbleby talks to the people. He meets a lot of young ones, whom you might hope would support democracy, free speech, human rights etc, but are actually massive Putin fans. He visits a hospitable lady called Maria who lives in an apartment block with her 10 children. Ten! They’ve built a clever triple-decker bunk system into the walls. Maria has a medal – the Order of Parental Glory – for having children. I’d say she has earned it. Her eldest is 24, her youngest just two that’s 22 years of manufacturing new Russians.Maria, who has her nails painted in the colours of the Russian flag, also likes Putin – he is strong, he has made the army strong, he likes big families, she likes his foreign policy. Dimbleby has an awkward conversation with the kids about the Queen – our Queen. He has met her twice, he tells them, though he has to think about it.The veteran BBC man turns away with a look of disgust. I don’t think Harvey, who once won a news scholarship with the BBC, should bother applying for the Question Time gig when – if – Dimbleby ever calls it a day. The clip from RT is about the Skripal case, incidentally: an interview with Sergei’s niece Viktoria, saying she was manipulated – not by the Kremlin though, but by MI5.Dimbleby also meets Vladimir Pozner, a veteran broadcaster with a weekly TV politics show – a sort of Russian David Dimbleby, then. Pozner’s show is on state-controlled Channel One, where he says he has more autonomy than most, and gets to choose who he has on, though he couldn’t have opposition leader Alexei Navalny on, for example. A politics show in which you can’t interview Putin’s main political opponent? It might seem incredible to us, but – well, things are different here.Hang on, Dimbleby’s not on Channel One, he could visit Navalny. Maybe he was in jail. I hope he tried.Dimbleby visits an independent radio station (allowed to exist so the Kremlin can claim free speech), where Yevgenia Albats, a campaigner for democracy, explains that Russia is a corporate state, run by the FSB. He meets Alena Popova, a women’s rights campaigner protesting against an MP accused of sexual harassment. While they are talking, a man from state security arrives, followed by someone who films her, then a counter-protester, the police … eventually Popova, who has only just been released, is arrested again. It’s farcical, hilarious … well, apart from the fact it’s state harassment of a woman protesting against sexual harassment, something she has every right to do. Popova is remarkably sanguine. I guess it’s normal, and has been for a long time.This is Russia, and they do things differently here – that’s the main conclusion of Dimbleby’s thorough and fascinating second Russian odyssey. Now it’s football time. I know it’s good for the atmosphere of a tournament if the host nation wins the opening game, but this isn’t making me feel the love. Who are they up against again? Saudi Arabia! Brilliant.

Photograph: Bryan O’Brien The Department of Education is reviewing the granting of exemptions from studying Irish amid evidence that thousands of students who secure them are sitting exams in foreign languages.The latest official figures show 3,851 students were granted an exemption to sit the Leaving Cert Irish exam in 2016 on the grounds of a disability.Almost 60 per cent of these (2,227 students) went on to study a European language such as French, German or Spanish.Students or their parents are required to submit a psychologist’s report in order to secure an exemption on the grounds of disability.However, the validity of some privately commissioned psychologists’ reports have been queried by senior education figures.The National University of Ireland (NUI) said it had challenged cases where psychologists’ reports were not accurate.“Where it has appeared to us that psychologists have not fully understood our criteria, we have clarified these for them,” said Dr Attracta O’Halpin, the NUI’s registrar. “We are keeping the system under review and are monitoring it closely.”Some school principals have questioned the reasons behind the numbers amid claims that the system is being “gamed” in order to avoid what many students perceive to be one of the most challenging Leaving Cert subjects.Clive Byrne, of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, said: “Certain school leaders have queried the increase in numbers of students with exemptions in Irish, and the implications it may have for third level progression.”However, the Dyslexia Association of Ireland has insisted there are genuine reasons why many students who secure exemptions end up studying a European language.The association says students with dyslexia need additional time and learning support in order to build their literacy skills in English at primary level.Many of these students may go on to learn a second language in secondary school at the same time as other pupils.While the association has accepted that some iniduals may try to “play” the system, it has said the criteria to get an Irish exemption on the grounds of dyslexia are very stringent.The Department has confirmed it is reviewing arrangements for the granting of exemptions from the study of Irish.It intends to publish the review and draft revised circulars early in the new school year.“The outcome of this public consultation process will inform the finalisation of revised arrangements for the granting of exemptions from the study of Irish,” it said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3529499.1528917559!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"antarctica intimately coupled with future of rest of planet","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIcebergs in the northern Weddell Sea off Antarctica:  ice loss is speeding up and adding even more to rising sea levels. Photograph: John SonntagNasa via The New York TimesIt may be the remotest region in the world but Antarctica is “intimately coupled” with the rest of the planet and human society, according to a group of eminent scientists.The next decade will be critical to Antarctica’s fate as choices made in that period will have long-lasting consequences across Earth, they predict.Two different “plausible future scenarios” for the continent are outlined one leading to irreversible changes and the other successfully countering the worst effects of global warming.Recent work by Prof Rob DeConto of the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the US highlighted the potential for Antarctica to contribute much more sea-level rise in the world’s oceans than previously considered.But it also showed how reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could reduce the exposure of low-lying coastlines and cities to rising seas.In a Nature paper this week, he says: “A reduction in emissions, in line with the aspirations of the Paris Climate Agreement, dramatically reduces the risk of flooding our coastlines in future decades and centuries.”He and eight co-authors accept their scenarios are “highly speculative”. They are “not forecasts but intended as starting points for discussion”. They touch on consequences for ice shelves, invasive species, ocean and land ecosystems, and humans.In the first scenario, “GHG emissions remained unchecked, the climate continued to warm” and the policy responses were ineffective with large ramifications in Antarctica and worldwide. Antarctica and the Southern Ocean would see dramatic loss of ice shelves, causing an acceleration in global sea-level rise.In the second scenario, “ambitious action” has been taken to limit emissions and to establish policies that reduce human pressure on the environment, slowing the rate of change and enhancing Antarctica’s resilience. It would look “much like it did in the early decades of the century”, with slower loss from the ice sheet and reduced threat of sea level rise.“GHG emissions must start decreasing in the coming decade to have a realistic prospect of following the low emissions narrative and so avoid global impacts,” said co-author Dr Steve Rintoul. “Actions can be taken now that will slow the rate of environmental change, increase the resilience of Antarctica, and reduce the risk we commit to irreversible changes with widespread impact.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3529538.1528920121!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"antarctic ice loss has surged in recent years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Ice floats near the coast of Antarctica. Photograph: NasaThe Antarctic ice sheet lost about 3 trillion tonnes of ice between 1992 and 2017, according to satellite analysis, with recent losses causing global sea levels to rise faster today than at any time in the past 25 years.There has been a threefold increase in ice losses from Antarctica in the period 2012 to 2017, which corresponds to a sea-level rise of about 3mm, the researchers conclude.Antarctica’s ice sheets, which contain enough water to raise global sea levels by 58m, are a key indicator of climate change, with rising global temperatures the single biggest contributor to ice sheet loss.In the most complete picture of Antarctic ice sheet change to date, published by the scientific journal Nature on Wednesday, 84 scientists from 44 international organisations combined 24 satellite surveys to produce an assessment.The project was directed by Prof Andrew Shepherd of the University of Leeds and Dr Erik Ivins of Nasa in the US.Prof Shepherd said: “We have long suspected changes in Earth’s climate will affect the polar ice sheets. Thanks to the satellites our space agencies have launched, we can now track their ice losses and global sea level contribution with confidence.”He added: “According to our analysis, there has been a step increase in ice losses from Antarctica during the past decade, and the continent is causing sea levels to rise faster today than at any time in the past 25 years. This has to be a concern for the governments we trust to protect our coastal cities and communities.”Dr Pippa Whitehouse of Durham University said: “Satellites have given us an amazing, continent-wide picture of how Antarctica is changing. The length of the satellite record now makes it possible for us to identify regions that have been undergoing sustained ice loss for over a decade.“The next piece of the puzzle is to understand the processes driving this change . . . we need to keep watching the ice sheet closely, but we also need to look back in time and try to understand how the ice sheet responded to past climate change.”Giant ice sheets, such as those in Antarctica and over Greenland, channel ice to the oceans through a network of glaciers and ice streams. Understanding current “ice-sheet mass balance” – the net balance of ice mass gains and losses – is key to estimating potential future changes in the ice sheet."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3529625.1528926355!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"psychiatrists resigning as position untenable and unsafe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil TD for Wexford James Browne said it was his understanding all other Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service staff working under the psychiatrists “can no longer effectively do their jobs because they’ve no one to oversee them”.  Photograph: Eric LukeChildren in Wexford and Waterford face the prospect of having no public consultant psychiatric services from next month due to the resignation of psychiatrists who are concerned about working in unsafe conditionsDr Kieran Moore, a specialist consultant paediatric psychiatrist, on Wednesday told the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Mental Healthcare that he and two of his colleagues from the southeast region were resigning. “I’m resigning from Wexford because it’s untenable and unsafe and two of my colleagues are doing the same,” he said. Dr Moore said patients were coming into a building that “is in a state” and where staff are “burnt out”. He said mental health services required continuous funding and “looking after the people who look after patients”. The prevalence of those suffering from mental health problems was increasing, he said, describing the issue as “a national emergency”. Senator Joan Freeman, the chair of the committee, which was examining staffing difficulties in psychiatric services, said that unless the psychiatrists are replaced “there will be no services for children” in Wexford and Waterford. “I personally find that extremely disturbing,” she said. Mr Browne said it was also his understanding that all other Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) staff working under the psychiatrists such as psychologists and occupational therapists “can no longer effectively do their jobs because they’ve no one to oversee them”. Dr Moore added “where I work in Wexford, there are five managers, none of them is clear about what they do”. “Honestly if we’re to talk about staff recruitment and retention, the one thing that works is if people feel valued and they don’t,” he said. In a statement, the HSE said it was currently operating a national and international recruitment campaign for consultant child and adolescent psychiatrists. “South East Community Healthcare plans to draw on this resource to fill positions on a permanent basis, in addition to vacancies being filled on an interim or temporary basis,” it said. Declan O’Hanlon, of the Irish Hospital Consultants’ Association, told the committee that of 44 consultant psychiatrist posts advertised in 2015 and 2016, about one-quarter had no applicants and 30 per cent had one applicant. “The failure to fill consultant psychiatrist posts is severely undermining the quality and quantity of the psychiatry service that can be provided to patients,” he said. Peter Hughes, general secretary of the Psychiatric Nurses’ Association said a recent survey of the union’s branches suggested there were about 500 nursing vacancies in the mental health services with shortages expected to “exacerbate significantly” in the next four years. Rosarii Mannion, the HSE’s national human resources director, said it is likely to face a changing industrial relations environment that may add to the challenges impacting on the overall attracting, recruitment and retention of staff. “Another significant emerging issue is the possible fallout from Brexit on the health workforce both in Ireland and in Britain and Northern Ireland over the next number of years,” Ms Mannion said.

The Taoiseach is also understood to have said the focus would remain on Brexit for now.Such a statement is likely to be criticised by those such as the DUP, who have repeatedly rejected any prospect of Brexit weakening Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom.Mr Varadkar spoke about the warm reception he received from both sides of the community in Northern Ireland during a trip last Friday, which saw him visit the headquarters of the Orange Order and the Féile an Phobail festival in west Belfast.The Taoiseach also spoke about housing issues, and an anticipated motion of no confidence in Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy.

But opposition TDs didn’t let the occasion of Leo Varadkar’s first anniversary as Taoiseach go unmarked.Technically, they were a little early but, as he doesn’t do Leaders’ Questions on Thursday, his milestone moment was noted a day in advance.Not even 40 years old yet and already a year in the top job.The Opposition members are deeply unimpressed and happily sneered their best wishes to him from across the floor.It was Catherine Murphy of the Social Democrats who mentioned Leo’s political landmark.“A year ago this week you became Taoiseach and told us of your vision for a republic of opportunities,” she reminded him, pointing out that his anniversary has coincided with a visit to Ireland from Leilani Farha, who is the UN Special Rapporteur on adequate housing.“Ms Farha had one clear message, and that is that Ireland is failing abysmally when it comes to housing,” Catherine told him.And speaking of the republic of opportunities, she threw in the latest comments from the Children’s Ombudsman who has described the position of almost 100,000 people in emergency accommodation as “shameful”.So how does Leo feel about the housing crisis getting worse since he took office and what does he intend to do to address this unacceptable situation?The Taoiseach rose to his feet and, naturally, began his response by ignoring the substance of the question. You don’t spend 12 months in the Taoiseach’s office and not learn a thing or two about talking down the clock in the Dáil.“It is indeed a year tomorrow – it’s my anniversary of my election as Taoiseach.”“Where’s the party?” wondered Mattie McGrath, in a somewhat sarcastic tone.Leo wittered on. “I have to say, eh, I’m not, I’m not one for anniversaries or birthdays. I’m known to forget them or very often decline to celebrate them.”But Leo wasn’t finished. “I think the milestones that are important are not the ones that appear on a calendar - they are the things you’ve achieved along the way.”And on he went.“I am very proud to have been part of a Government in the past year that has successfully brought about a referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment, has at long last ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, has brought employment to record levels – the highest ever. . .”There was hardly a dry seat in the House.“A lot more to do!” chortled Sinn Féin’s Sean Crowe.Leo pressed on with his greatest hits. But he was performing for a tough crowd.Róisín Shortall of the Soc Dems told him to get on with it. “Answer the question and stop trying to run down the clock.”As a derisory chorus of “more to do!” rang around the chamber, the Taoiseach continued singing his own praises.“. . . has balanced the books, has improved living standards, has reduced income inequality, has reduced poverty and reduced deprivation . . .”“It’s the Leo show,” harrumphed Mattie.Finally, Leo got around to the question, sounding like he’d swallowed Fianna Fáil’s 2002 “A lot done. More to do” election manifesto for breakfast.“But, as the hecklers rightly point out, there is a lot more to do and there is always more to do and, particularly, housing is one of those areas in which there is very much more to do.”Delivering a searing insight into how to tackle the homeless crisis, Leo declared: “What we actually need to do is build more houses and the crux of the solution to this is increasing housing supply.” Since he became Taoiseach, planning permissions and commencement notices are up by 30 per cent, while the construction of 18,000 new homes has started in the past year, he added.“House prices and rents are also up,” retorted Fianna Fáil’s John Lahart.“Fiasco!” roared his colleague, Eugene Murphy.“What about social housing?” demanded Sinn Féin’s Dessie Ellis as the anniversary boy continued his recitation. “More so than any year in the past 10. ESB connections again up 30 per cent, employment in the construction sector up 14 per cent.”“We’re all grand so,” giggled Brendan Howlin.In the year to come, his Government will be adding up to 8,000 new social homes, promised Leo, flushed with success after his fabulous year.“So we have a long, long way to go yet . . . We are finally starting to catch up and we’re starting to see that now in the figures. But the Deputy is absolutely right, we have much more to do and it’s going to take many more years.”Catherine Murphy thought it would be a good idea if the Taoiseach formally met Leilani Farha to discuss housing policy as she has some tangible solutions around developing a coherent housing strategy, especially in areas such as the private rental sector.Leo wasn’t against the idea, although he knows Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy has already met her. Although Leilani “at the time, hadn’t had the chance to read Rebuilding Ireland, so perhaps, as part of that engagement, we could get her views on Rebuilding Ireland and what she thinks of that.”Some gals have all the luck.And, still with the Varadkar landmark date, Independent TD Tommy Broughan was also looking to rain on Leo’s parade.“Taoiseach, is it not a characteristic of your first year in office that we are having a growing breakdown of law and order?” he asked.“It seems as though almost every day of the week now we have an appalling murder or homicide,” observed Tommy, taking out a big pin to burst Leo’s happy anniversary balloon. “It’s astonishing, isn’t it, that Fine Gael is presiding over this growing lawlessness and appalling homicides and appalling criminal behaviour. What are you going to do about it?”No, it is not astonishing, sniffed Leo. Furthermore, the number of gardaí has never been higher.He told Tommy he was “misinformed and out of date”.And anyway, it isn’t even his anniversary.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3522835.1528382517!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gene activity offers a window into kidney transplants","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Barbara Murphy: ensuring better outcomes for kidney transplant patients. Photograph: Claudia Paul Prof Barbara Murphy, chair of the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine, the Murray M Rosenberg Professor of Medicine and the Dean of Clinical Integration and Population Management at the Icahn School of Medicine at the Mount Sinai Health System in New YorkYour research is looking to improve kidney transplants, what are you doing?“We are developing new ways to predict when a transplanted kidney is likely to become damaged over the long term, so the person who received the kidney can be managed more effectively in order to prolong the survival of that organ. The hope then is they will not need another transplant as quickly or hopefully not at all.How are you going about that?We have been looking both at biopsies from kidneys following transplant and also at blood samples from recipients. We are finding patterns of genes that are being switched on that can tell us if a person is at higher risk of rejecting that kidney either acutely in the short term, or if they are at risk of the kidney becoming chronically damaged over the longer term.How has the work been going?Really well. We have published some big studies – one in The Lancet – and we are in the process of submitting another two studies. In the Lancet study, we found that a gene profile in biopsies taken from the recipients three months after the transplant was able to predict their risk of the kidney being damaged by a year after the transplant. The idea is that you can then use this profile to treat the recipients who are at risk, with the aim of protecting the kidney and thereby preventing it from failing.And what about the blood samples?We have been looking at gene activity in blood because it’s an easier sample for patients to give than a kidney biopsy. That work has been going well, we have found a set of genes that are active in the blood that can tell even before a person has had a transplant how likely they are to have a rejection episode after transplantation.What is the big reward of doing all this work?Well, we would hope that thanks to the approach we are taking it will be possible to stratify patients into high and low risk before a transplant, and then treat them appropriately at the time of the transplant and monitor them more closely overall. That would hopefully lead to less rejection and damage of kidneys. It would also mean that people that were low risk could avoid unnecessary exposure to high levels of immunosuppression and as a result decrease their risk of infection and cancer.And the challenges?The time it takes. I applied for the funding to start this research back in 2005 and we started in 2008. It took a long time to set everything up and enrol patients and follow them over time, to take the biopsies and the blood and analyse the results. You also always need to be thinking of what it takes to translate these assays into clinical care. It often means seeking investment from companies and setting up trials across multiple centres so you can demonstrate the true impact.You received an honorary doctorate from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland last month, how did that feel?It was brilliant, to get this award from my alma mater was wonderful. My husband and our son were there for it, and my mum and dad too, which made it even more special.And how do you like to get a break from all the research?I like mainly outdoorsy things: biking, hiking, gardening. We are based in New York but we have a place in Vermont and that is where you can totally switch off. We love going up there."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3529354.1528908499!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit backstop is no temporary little arrangement","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHelen Slater, from Bristol, joins anti-Brexit demonstrators as they wave European Union and Union flags outside the Houses of Parliament in London on Wednesday. Photograph: Rick FindlerPA WireA “temporary little arrangement” (TLA) was how Albert Reynolds described the Fianna Fáil-PD coalition of the late 1980s. A necessary, but grubby compromise his party would soon put behind them.And yet, as a description of the wishful thinking and denial in Fianna Fáil’s unwillingness to face up to the permanent eclipse of its days of governing single-handed, there is a nice historical irony in the euphemism.The same is likely to prove true of the latter-day TLA, the Northern Ireland “backstop”, and the “temporary customs arrangement” that the UK has floated as its version of the latter.Far from temporary, the backstop is increasingly looking as if it will have to be a permanent fixture. An unfortunate but necessary fixture alongside any EU-UK trade deal and, like it or not, accompanied by customsregulatory controls, as Michel Barnier put it last week, “on the ferries”.Ever since the December joint agreement which set out this fallback guarantee for the frictionless Irish Border it has become clearer by the day that the UK has no clue how to operationalise a commitment it increasingly regrets. Without, that is, introducing customs checks on the Irish Sea and fatally alienating the DUP.In truth the UK can say the December agreement did not specifically treat Northern Ireland apart from the rest of the UK, as the EU did in its subsequent draft legal text.The European Commission insists that its version of this commitment is the best way to preserve the integrity of the single market, making an exception to its rules for a relatively confined area.London has always made clear it regards the backstop guarantee as very much a second choice, an option not to be deployed unless by the end of the transition period a deal has not been agreed on a comprehensive EU-UK tradecustoms arrangement, and then until such an arrangement is put in place. That would allow, they argue, a simple one-stop changeover for businesses.In suggesting that the EU task force’s Northern Ireland deal – continued participation by the North in the customs union and in major regulatory alignment\u0026nbsp– can be extended to the rest of the UK for that post-transition hiatus, London is effectively asking for a further extension of the transition for what it says\u0026nbspit “expects” to be no more than a year. In fact, indefinitely, a reality that has surprisingly caused no adverse reaction yet among diehard Brexiteers.But in doing so it is asking the EU to extend to the rest of the UK unique-to-Northern-Ireland “cherrypicking” exceptions to single market rules that the union has agreed exceptionally to safeguard the frictionless border and the achievements of the Belfast Agreement.The 27 are adamant that is not a runner and say that the UK must come up with an alternative legal commitment by October, or, quite simply, there will be no withdrawal agreement and no transition, the ultimate hard Brexit. That means serious work by the UK on both the Irish and “future relationship” tracks of talks in the next couple of months.London’s “temporary customs arrangement” is remarkable for two assumptions. Firstly, that a comprehensive EU-UK future relationship agreement can be agreed in political form by October\u0026nbspwithout the UK rethinking its red lines on the customs union and single market membership. A free trade agreement may be possible, but certainly not borderless.And the related assumption that such an agreement will be such as to provide all the safeguards and guarantees with which the backstop promises to copperfasten the frictionless border. “The UK is clear,” its paper last week acknowledged, “that the future customs arrangement needs to deliver on the commitments made in relation to Northern Ireland.”In the likely absence of a deal that meets such a high benchmark, there is no doubt that the EU and the Irish will insist that the backstop provisions remain in place alongside any EUUK deal. And specifically that the inevitable regulatory ergence that will emerge quickly between the North and the rest of the UK be reflected in customsregulatory checks in the Irish Sea.The UK level of ambition is breathtaking, a combination of that TLA wishful thinking and denial that suggests, as bewildered EU officials keep reiterating, that London still does not understand that it cannot behave as if it wishes to continue availing of all the benefits of membership.

Photograph: Mark WilsonGetty The United States hopes to see “major disarmament” in North Korea by 2020, secretary of state Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday as President Donald Trump continued to hail his historic meeting with Kim Jong-un as a success. Speaking on his way to Beijing, Mr Pompeo told reporters that he believed that North Korea understood there would be “in-depth verification” of its denuclearisation promise – despite no details being included in the final summit communique. “I am . . . confident they understand that there will be in-depth verification,” he said, adding he was hopeful major disarmament could be achieved in 2½ years. He said Tuesday’s agreement between Trump and Kim had not captured all of what had been agreed by the two sides, and described questions about gaps in the summit’s statement as “insulting and ridiculous”. “Not all of that work appeared in the final document. But lots of other places where there were understandings reached, we couldn’t reduce them to writing, so that means there’s still some work to do, but there was a great deal of work done that is beyond what was seen in the final document,” he said.Nonetheless, he said that there was still “a great deal of work to do” and “a long way to go with North Korea”.While he said he did not know the exact timing of his next conversation with the North Koreans, engagement was likely to begin in the next week or so. “I don’t know exactly what the timing will be for our next conversation with the North Koreans,” he said. “I would anticipate it will be fairly quickly after we return to our home countries.”Mr Trump meanwhile hailed his summit with the North Korean leader as he arrived back in Washington on Wednesday, claiming that there was “no longer a nuclear threat” from North Korea.“Everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office,” he said on Twitter shortly after disembarking Air Force One. “There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea. Meeting with Kim Jong-un was an interesting and very positive experience. North Korea has great potential for the future!”Mr Trump also hit out at criticism of his surprise announcement that joint military exercises with South Korea would cease – a key concession to the North Korean side. “We save a fortune by not doing war games, as long as we are negotiating in good faith – which both sides are!” he tweeted. Mr Trump also lashed out at the media for its coverage of the summit, claiming that “fake news” was the country’s biggest enemy. “So funny to watch the Fake News, especially NBC and CNN. They are fighting hard to downplay the deal with North Korea. 500 days ago they would have ‘begged’ for this deal – looked like war would break out. Our Country’s biggest enemy is the Fake News so easily promulgated by fools.”Mr Trump’s announcement that military exercises on the Korean Peninsula, which have been in place for decades, would stop took many observers by surprise. Japan’s uneasiness at the development was reflected in comments by the country’s defence minister who said that “US-South Korean joint exercises and the US military presence in South Korea is vital to security in East Asia”.Earlier on Wednesday Pyongyang said the president had agreed to ease sanctions – despite Mr Trump insisting during his post-summit press conference that sanctions would only be eased if North Korea “de-nukes”.Former US diplomat Richard Haass was among those who criticised the president’s claim that North Korea was no longer a nuclear threat. “The summit changed nothing,” he said on Twitter. “Worse yet, overselling the summit makes it harder to keep sanctions in place, further reducing pressure on NK to reduce (much less give up) its nuclear weapons and missiles.”Historic meeting between US president Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un"},{"url":null,"title":"magnum freedom project pictures","story":"1968 was a seismic year of deep societal and political shifts.

who are counterclaiming against the Russells for around £20,000 in unpaid fees - said the blame for the delay, the walkout by the builders and the significant overspend lay with the Russells.She described their attitude as unrealistic and impractical and said late design decisions bedeviled this project, adding: The problems on this project were not of PSP\u0027s making.Peter and Linda Stone, who managed the bespoke project, arriving at courtThe Stones consistently advised and warned Mr and Mrs Russell that it was imperative that they make design decisions to enable the building works to progress and of the dangers should they fail to do so. But they were unable or unwilling to heed that advice and these are the very dangers which befell this project, Ms McCafferty told the judge.They chose to ignore that advice at the time and, all these years on, still seem unable to understand those consequences.Ms McCafferty added: This is all the more distressing for Mr and Mrs Stone because they strongly believed that they did a very good job in very challenging circumstances on this difficult project.In the witness box, Mr Russell, 62, defended the time he and his wife took in making a decision over their choice of interior fittings, telling Mrs Justice Jefford: If you\u0027d seen the house you\u0027d understand this is not some Barratt home.”He added: Dealing with curves in this way is so complex. It\u0027s very difficult to fit it together. Take our television room I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a word to describe something that has one straight line and three curves.”Mr Russell, a director at more than 20 property and finance companies in London, said it was perfectly reasonable to be concerned over the interior details. But he rejected accusations he and his wife had procrastinated over their choices..What we wanted was our house to be our house with everything we wanted. If you are building your own home, you want the design to be what you want and the quality to be what you want,” he said. I think where we live has a certain expectation of level of standard.”Luxury property and architectureStorm Hector poses a threat to life with winds of up to 70mph, Met Office warnsOxfam Great Britain permanently banned from operating in Haiti after sex scandalPolice investigate elder abuse of Marvel Comics\u0026#39 Stan LeeRocks balanced since the Ice Age have been toppled and destroyed by yobsPushy parents told to stop using smartphone video evidence to challenge sports day resultsFoie gras imports could be banned after Brexit on ethical groundsTrident nuclear sites at risk due to \u0026#39exodus\u0026#39 of MoD PoliceGrenfell Tower floodlit green to mark one-year anniversary  Three bodies found at foot of Beachy Head as police hunt for fourth personFacebook exposes British children to violence and bullying, major NSPCC study findsHow Theresa May claimed her Brexit majority in the Lords\u0026#39 AmendmentsSocial worker criticised as child is taken away from mother because she refused to give him ice creamRussia’s successful World Cup bid was rated worst for \u0026#39threat and risk\u0026#39, FIFA documents showStephen Hawking\u0026#39s voice to be beamed into black hole while his ashes are interred at Westminster AbbeyBulmers cider magnates lured alleged art thieves with fake advert in antiques magazine, court hearsEd Sheeran\u0026#39s open-air German concert may be thwarted by trees British expat, 72, shot dead on his farm in row with neighbour over the propertyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 13 june 2018","story":"Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un\u0027s summit, Shakira performing at the O2 Arena and a Vallarta mud turtle are some of Wednesday\u0027s pictures of the dayStorm Hector poses a threat to life with winds of up to 70mph, Met Office warnsOxfam Great Britain permanently banned from operating in Haiti after sex scandalPolice investigate elder abuse of Marvel Comics\u0026#39 Stan LeeRocks balanced since the Ice Age have been toppled and destroyed by yobsPushy parents told to stop using smartphone video evidence to challenge sports day resultsFoie gras imports could be banned after Brexit on ethical groundsTrident nuclear sites at risk due to \u0026#39exodus\u0026#39 of MoD PoliceGrenfell Tower floodlit green to mark one-year anniversary  Three bodies found at foot of Beachy Head as police hunt for fourth personFacebook exposes British children to violence and bullying, major NSPCC study findsHow Theresa May claimed her Brexit majority in the Lords\u0026#39 AmendmentsSocial worker criticised as child is taken away from mother because she refused to give him ice creamRussia’s successful World Cup bid was rated worst for \u0026#39threat and risk\u0026#39, FIFA documents showStephen Hawking\u0026#39s voice to be beamed into black hole while his ashes are interred at Westminster AbbeyBulmers cider magnates lured alleged art thieves with fake advert in antiques magazine, court hearsEd Sheeran\u0026#39s open-air German concert may be thwarted by trees British expat, 72, shot dead on his farm in row with neighbour over the propertyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"royal mail bans patriotic postal workers flying england flags","story":"digitalservices@telegraphBosses at the company say flags and stickers could blow off and become \u0026#34hazards\u0026#34 or obscure drivers\u0026#39 visionThe Royal Mail has banned patriotic postal workers from flying England flags during the World Cup on their delivery vehicles.Staff branded the decision as bonkers but bosses at the company say flags and stickers could blow off and become hazards or obscure drivers\u0027 vision.The ban affects all 125,000 Royal Mail delivery staff, based at 1,400 delivery depots across the country. Royal Mail said 25,000 backroom staff not in the public view would be allowed to display flags.A postman in south-west London said: It\u0027s bonkers, frankly.

We always try to find ways to support them in times like this, while at the same time reducing unnecessary food waste. “British strawberries are also typically brighter in colour and tastier compared with imported varieties, meaning our customers can enjoy more of the fruit at the best time of the year.”Growers are also getting a good deal each farm will be paid the same rate per kg of produce by Aldi as they would have done without the promotion.Tesco is also running a promotion, selling two of its £2 400g punnets for £3, while Sainsbury\u0027s has reduced its 400g punnet from £2 to £1.60.The cold spring meant the fruit took longer to ripen - making it more deliciousFarmers are urging customers to get their strawberries while they are still cheap and deliciously sweet.Nick Marston, chairman of British Summer Fruits, said: February and March this year were considerably colder than in 2017. The strawberry crops develop more slowly if the weather is cooler.There is a good level of supply, and because they\u0027ve ripened more slowly they are bigger, tastier and juicier than last year.Because there is a good level of supply supermarkets have promotions in place for the next few days. These include Kilo boxes, two for one deals and all sorts. We say that customers should rush out and buy strawberries now while the offers are on the very good quality fruit.He added that while the strawberry season usually starts on May 1, the chilly spring meant it was a week and a half late. Now, the crop is in full swing, and it is likely the season will carry on successfully until July.However, those hoping the glut will mean a discount day out at Wimbledon are going to be disappointed.A spokesperson for the tennis competition said: The strawberries and cream at Wimbledon will once again be priced at £2.50 – the price has remained the same since 2010.Please review our commenting policyStorm Hector poses a threat to life with winds of up to 70mph, Met Office warnsOxfam Great Britain permanently banned from operating in Haiti after sex scandalPolice investigate elder abuse of Marvel Comics\u0026#39 Stan LeeRocks balanced since the Ice Age have been toppled and destroyed by yobsPushy parents told to stop using smartphone video evidence to challenge sports day resultsFoie gras imports could be banned after Brexit on ethical groundsTrident nuclear sites at risk due to \u0026#39exodus\u0026#39 of MoD PoliceGrenfell Tower floodlit green to mark one-year anniversary  Three bodies found at foot of Beachy Head as police hunt for fourth personFacebook exposes British children to violence and bullying, major NSPCC study findsHow Theresa May claimed her Brexit majority in the Lords\u0026#39 AmendmentsSocial worker criticised as child is taken away from mother because she refused to give him ice creamRussia’s successful World Cup bid was rated worst for \u0026#39threat and risk\u0026#39, FIFA documents showStephen Hawking\u0026#39s voice to be beamed into black hole while his ashes are interred at Westminster AbbeyBulmers cider magnates lured alleged art thieves with fake advert in antiques magazine, court hearsEd Sheeran\u0026#39s open-air German concert may be thwarted by trees British expat, 72, shot dead on his farm in row with neighbour over the propertyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"alexithymia condition impacts emotions new research science","story":"One in 10 people struggle to recognise their emotions. New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen.

Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future.

For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.”In another passage, he describes “bandit-like filthy Levantines” who board his ship during a stop at Port Said, Egypt.“In the harbour, a swarm of rowing boats with screaming and gesticulating Levantines of every shade, who lunge at our ship. As if spewed from hell,” he wrote.Ze’ev Rosenkranz, the book’s editor and assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at the California Institute of Technology, told : “I think a lot of comments strike us as pretty unpleasant – what he says about the Chinese in particular.“They’re kind of in contrast to the public image of the great humanitarian icon. I think it’s quite a shock to read those and contrast them with his more public statements. They’re more off guard, he didn’t intend them for publication.”In his preface to The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein, Mr Rosenkranz says the diaries exhibit a “quirky style” and “acerbic quips” but also contain some “troublesome entries”.“I began to ask myself: how could this humanist icon be the author of such passages?” Mr Rosenkranz writes.He adds it “seems clear that Einstein has bought - to some extent - into the perceived threat of ‘the yellow peril’,” referring to the racist colonial trope that the people of East Asia were a threat to the western world.Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, the\u0026nbspcosmologist, science writer and equality campaigner, said Einstein’s racism was “shocking and disappointing”.Even Einstein couldn\u0027t think of a peace planLegendary physicist Albert Einstein left letters that reveal his thoughts on the relationship between Arabs and JewsThe correspondence also includes a letter from Einstein’s former lover, Betty NeumannDuring the British mandate, Einstein engaged“I am both surprised and not surprised,” she tweeted. “Scientific ‘advance’\u0026nbspreally does not go in tandem with social advances. Sometimes scientific success drags racism along with its interlocutors.”Einstein toured Asia after being invited to speak in Japan shortly after being awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1921.By contrast to his prejudice against the Chinese, Einstein speaks positively of the Japanese, who he praises as “unostentatious, decent, altogether very appealing”.His diaries from the period have previously only been published in German as part of the 15-volume Collected Papers of Albert Einstein.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But protoplanets of this kind cannot be found using those techniques.Though thousands of exoplanets have been discovered in the last few decades, detecting protoplanets is at the frontier of science, said Christophe Pinte of Monash University in Australia and lead author on one of the two papers.The scientists found the planets by looking out for disturbances in the gas-filled disk around the star. They looked for a particular kind of light that is emitted by the movement of carbon monoxide – which allows them to understand how the gas in the disk is churning around.If there were no planets in the disk, then the gas would move with a simple, predictable pattern. But unusual movement would seem to suggest there is some large body there.It would take a relatively massive object, like a planet, to create localized disturbances in this otherwise orderly motion, said Pinte. Our new technique applies this principle to help us understand how planetary systems form.They saw three of those disturbances, each of which is thought to be caused by a different\u0026nbspplanet.There are other potential explanations for the strange data coming back from the star. But the new findings are the strongest evidence yet that there are new worlds forming in our own galactic neighbourhood.The discovery was made by analysing images sent back from highly-powered telescopes pointing deep into the galaxy, in a way never done before.We looked at the localised, small-scale motion of gas in the star\u0027s protoplanetary disc. This entirely new approach could uncover some of the youngest planets in our galaxy, all thanks to the high-resolution images from ALMA, said Richard Teague, an astronomer at the University of Michigan and principal author on the other paper.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Addressing an audience that included the boxer Nikolai Valuev, he said the time had come to create a “permanent system” of interaction between the church and sports community.\u0026nbsp“Sport offers a way to elevate man’s physical and spiritual culture, and it should be a tool for the Church,” the Russian Orthodox primate said. “The task of an athlete is the same as that of a monk without self-control there can be no success.”\u0026nbspThe task of an athlete is the same as that of a monk without self-control there can be no successPriests across the country have played their part in preparing the country for the tournament. They have blessed the stadiums and the teams. They have delivered sermons on the Christian nature of team sports. On Wednesday, the Patriarch gave his own blessing to the tournament.\u0026nbspHe is expected to attend Thursday’s grand opening – just as he did at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. \u0026nbsp“The Patriarch wants to make the sports community more Christian,” press secretary Vakhtang Kipshidze tells\u0026nbspThe Independent. “The World Cup is great chance to do that, to help those new to the Church understand our spirituality.”\u0026nbspMore than 70 per cent of Russians identify as Christian, but most wear that badge lightly.If one recent survey is to believed, no more than 6 per cent actually attend mass. But having been neutered during the Soviet era, the Russian Orthodox Church is now very much a force to be reckoned with. Much of its new relevance comes from an ever-closer bond with the state.\u0026nbspUnder its current leadership, the Church has embraced the key tenets of Putinism: nationalism, exceptionalism, traditionalism, and hostility to liberalism and gay rights.Some of its members played prominent roles in the Kremlin military campaigns in Syria and Ukraine, occasionally even blessing weapons systems.The Patriarch regularly declares his fondness for Mr Putin, and threw his weight behind the president’s recent re-election campaign. His “vivid” victory spoke of the unity of the nation, he said.\u0026nbspAt the Church of Saint Nicholas, a few blocks away, Father Alexander Shumsky is also, it seems, a fan.\u0026nbspPutin is a gift from God. And the World Cup was a gift from Putin. It is only thanks to our president, his determined efforts, that we have got the tournament in our country, thank the Lord“Putin is a gift from God,” he tells The Independent. “And the World Cup was a gift from Putin. It is only thanks to our president, his determined efforts, that we have got the tournament in our country, thank the Lord.”\u0026nbspFather\u0026nbspShumsky says the Russian World Cup will allow the Church to show the best of its traditional values to the world. It was only right for the Church to step in to “nourish” and “influence” the athletes, he adds. \u0026nbspThe priest, a former amateur footballer, says he is looking forward to seeing his favourite players on Russian soil. From the current crop, he likes the “traditionalist” Lionel Messi – “He’s a believer, you see it when he crosses himself after scoring a goal. A good lad, someone who loves his family.”Away from the World Cup: the secret lives of goalposts in RussiaA boy hangs from a goalpost in St. PetersburgSelf-made goalposts stand on a soccer pitch in Verkhnyaya Biryusa village, located in the Taiga area near the Russian Siberian city of KrasnoyarskA boy rides a bicycle near a goalpost in Yevpatoria, CrimeaHay fills a goalpost during the traditional Cossack games outside the village of Arkhonskaya in the Republic of North Ossetia, AlaniaA car is seen through a goalpost while driving along a road in the Siberian village of TyulkovoChildren play at a goalpost during the traditional Cossack games outside the village of Arkhonskaya in the Republic of North Ossetia, AlaniaA goalpost stands in the village of Pribrezhnoye, CrimeaPeople and dogs walk near a goalpost on the Ostrov Otdykha (the Island of Rest), located in the middle of the Yenisei RiverA boy rides a gyro-scooter near a goalpost on a football pitch in the Siberian town of DivnogorskCossacks sit on a bench next to a goalpost covered with a screen during the traditional Cossack games outside the village of Arkhonskaya in the Republic of North OssetiaA goalpost stands in front of an Orthodox church in the Siberian village of Tyulkovo Goalposts lay on the ground as people gather at a flooded beach on the bank of the Volga River in SamaraA goalpost stands in YevpatoriaA man sits on a goalpost in the settlement of Novo-Schedrinskaya, ChechnyaA participant is seen through a goalpost during an amateur football tournament at the Zenit Arena, a stadium made from straw, in StravropolA goalpost in a yard of a Stalin-era high-rise building in MoscowGoats walk near a goalpost in the village of Pervomayskoye, CrimeaA goalpost stands at a tourist centre on the bank of the Belyo Lake in the Republic of Khakassia, SiberiaA goalpost stands in the town of Dolgoprudny in the Moscow regionA man runs near goalposts on a football pitch in a settlement in Stavropol regionA dog stands near a goalpost in Ryazantsevo settlement in Yaroslavl regionChildren play with a puppy near a goalpost on a football pitch in the Siberian settlement of NovosyolovoA goalpost stands in the village of Lesnovka, Saksky district, CrimeaA goalpost stands in the village of Zhuravli, CrimeaA man rides a horse near a goalpost in the village of Bolshaya Dzhalga in Stavropol regionA goalpost stands in Sevastopol, CrimeaA cadet holds a model of a sword in front of a goalpost as he trains at the stadium of the General Yermolov Cadet School in StavropolA goalpost stands in the village of Glinka, Saksky region, CrimeaHe is not so keen on Cristiano Ronaldo – “A bit different, isn’t he, from a liberal background.”\u0026nbspFather Shumsky came to prominence during the last World Cup in Brazil, when he declared the tournament to be the work of Sodom. The basis for his judgement appeared to be because some of the players were playing in bright pink boots.\u0026nbsp“I felt it wasn’t right, blue boots are much more masculine,” he says today. “I’m totally against all these rainbow images too.”If official statements are to be believed, Father Shumsky will be left disappointed by this World Cup too. Organisers have promised that the World Cup will be an LGBT+ friendly event, and traditional Russian state hostility to gay rights is set to be toned down for a month. There will be no prosecutions for unveiling rainbow symbols inside the stadium.\u0026nbspThe leader of a nationalistic vigilante group\u0026nbspassociated with the Church said he hoped Russian traditions would be enough to “discipline” visitors.“Perhaps the visitors might act differently in other countries, but in Russia people are simply forced to respect our thousands of years of history and culture,” says Andrei Kormukhin, leader of the 40x40 movement.Russia would prove to be the most hospitable nation on earth – “but there will be no gays with bare bottoms out on the streets of Moscow”.\u0026nbspIn Russia people are simply forced to respect our thousands of years of history and culture ...\u0026nbspthere will be no gays with bare bottoms out on the streets of MoscowThough not actually listed among official attendees, Mr Kormukhin says his organisation was among those participating in the Church’s new sports commission. \u0026nbsp“Putin has said that by 2024, 55 per cent of Russians should be doing sport, so of course the Church needs to establish themselves in the country’s sporting life,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbspGiven recent miserable form, some have joked that the full force of Russian spirituality is not yet established within the national football team.\u0026nbspOn Wednesday, Patriarch Kirill seemed to address such concerns, calling for the country to “hope and pray” that the Russian team played well.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This is how it all works.Analysis has shown that naming storms makes people more aware of the severe weather and helps them prepare in advance.So the Met Office and its Irish counterpart Met Eireann decided to follow the US system of giving girls and boys names to tropical storms and hurricanes.In the winter season of 2016/17, the names included Angus, Barbara, Conor and Doris.Surveys showed people were more aware of the threat and more likely to take action after hearing the name of a storm, rather than a forecast simply saying bad weather is on the way.For example, 89 per cent of people said they were aware of the approaching Storm Doris – which wreaked havoc in February 2017 – and 94 per cent said warnings were useful.The Met Office and Met Eireanns joint list of names for 2017/2018 includes Larry, Victor and Hector among the male choices, with Georgina, Octavia and Winifred among the female names.As in the US system, they follow in alphabetical order with alternating male and female names. A male name, Angus, was first last year so this year the first is female, Aileen.A total of 21 names were chosen by Met Office and Met Eireann – whittled down from a total of more than 10,000 suggestions submitted by the public.One name was picked for each letter of the alphabet, apart from Q, U, X, Y and Z.Every major storm will be named according to the list, ordered alphabetically.Caroline (assigned)Dylan (assigned)Eleanor (assigned)Fionn (F-yunn) (assigned)Georgina (assigned)Hector (assigned)IonaJamesKarenLarryMaeveNiall (Nye-al)OctaviaPaulRebeccaSimonTaliVictorWinifredSo Aileen is first followed by Brian, then Caroline, then Dylan and so on.The 2017 Autumn storm season kicked off with Storm Aileen and was then followed by Storm Brian.After those ones came Storm Caroline, while Dylan and Eleanor hit over the Christmas and New Year period.However - there was a slight glitch to the system in Storm Emma - so why was it different to whats next on the list?The answer is that Storm Emma was named by the Portuguese met office as that is where the storm originated.Because it has been named by a national meteorological service, the weather system retains its name as it crosses international borders.Storm Hector is the latest UK storm, set to bring 70mph gusts of wind across the country when it hits around June 14.Whether a storm is considered big enough to have its own name comes down to the probable impact on people in Britain and Ireland.A storm will be named when it has the potential to cause an amber be prepared or red take action warning.Other weather types will also be considered, specifically rain if its impact could lead to flooding as advised by the Environment Agency, SEPA and Natural Resources Wales flood warnings.Therefore storms systems could be named on the basis of impacts from wind but also include the impacts of rain and snow.To ensure the Met Office is in line with the US National Hurricane Centre naming conventions, it does not include names which begin with the letters Q, U, X, Y and Z.This is to ensure consistency for official storm naming in the North Atlantic - to reduce confusion for fellow weather experts, sea captains and pilots.In America, when all the names in the storm alphabet are used, names are given following the Greek alphabet (Alpha, Beta, Gamma…).Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The most dangerous would be a mortal blow to the Government’s negotiating hand and could trigger a new election.Another one on Wednesday would be a giant step towards shackling ourselves forever inside an EU customs union, without any power over its decisions. That’s the worst possible Brexit, a catastrophe.Monday nights fudge between the two wings of the Tory party is still a risk — and merely postpones an inevitable showdown next month.In the end MPs must have faith in our great country, our extraordinary talent and our ability to thrive outside the EU. And, if they respect the democracy that has put them where they are, they must trust the decision we took.Todays “meaningful vote” amendment, if passed, would wreck the Government’s negotiating position in Brussels. That is already weak enough... Theresa May has made far too many compromises and is doing far too little to prepare Britain for a “no deal”. But this new move would be deadly.It would enable Parliament to reject any deal we strike with Brussels and force the Government to go back and keep negotiating. It would strip Mrs May of the power to walk away.The EU could offer us a derisory and punitive deal knowing Parliament had compelled the Government to accept it in the end. It would be like haggling with a used car salesman who knows you have to pay whatever he wants.The diehard Remainers running an orchestrated, multi-million pound campaign to keep Britain in the EU are relying on this vote to upend the process. It could trigger a second referendum or an election which Corbyn’s Marxist wrecking crew could win.Tory rebels must have nothing to do with it. It is their duty to give the Government the strongest possible hand in negotiating our exit and a future trade deal.Another vote on Wednesday seeks to push us into a restrictive customs union with the EU. That would place us permanently and powerlessly under Brussels’ control — with no say over it, nor any ability to sign our own deals around the world.Free trade with America, China, India, Australia, Canada and New Zealand? Forget it.Remain-backing MPs pretend this — and staying in the single market — represent “soft Brexit”, a compromise to reflect that 48 per cent voted Remain. But they are fatal to Brexit and they know it.Either would be a far worse deal than we have had before. They are a ruse to engineer a new vote to stay in.We get that Europhile MPs hate Brexit. But they are there to represent their voters, not advance personal agendas.For some Tories and many Labour MPs the decision should be blindingly obvious: their own constituencies voted Leave. The manifestos on which they then stood for election last year promised to leave both the single market and customs union.Do they seriously believe it right to betray their voters and their own doorstep promises?Most people are too busy to follow the daily ins and outs as the Brexit debate grinds on. Outside the London political bubble, they imagine it’s done and dusted. They just want to get on with leaving. And in full.It has barely occurred to them that many politicians never accepted the result, have waged war on it relentlessly and are closer than ever to victory.Imagine the explosion of anger if that happens. If, today or next month, Tory Remainers vote with Labour’s opportunists to defy the biggest democratic mandate in British history. If MPs, having approved the EU Withdrawal Bill once already, back wrecking amendments drafted by unelected peers bent on destroying Brexit.That rage won’t even be limited to Leavers. Many Remainers also consider it vital to fulfil the result of the vote in full. They know staying in the single market or customs union is not leaving. It is a suicidal, half-baked Brexit.Why would anyone trust our democracy again if we took such a course, in defiance of the referendum result?The Sun understands the Tory rebels’ fears for the economy and jobs post-Brexit. We believe we may well be in for a rocky ride short-term, before the longer-term benefits pan out.But everyone should read the authoritative view from ex-Aussie Prime Minister Tony Abbott — who initially backed Remain but is brimming with confidence over what he considers a golden opportunity for this country, even if we never strike any deal with Brussels.The Sun understands, too, the worries many Remainers have that Britain could become less ­liberal, less open and more prejudiced against foreign migrants after Brexit. We whole-heartedly believe that’s unfounded.Brits are becoming MORE welcoming, secure now in the knowledge we are at last about to get the same control over numbers every non-EU country enjoys.On these two ​vital days for Brexit — and further votes next month — The Sun says this to backbench Tories: Have faith in the people of Britain.They made the right decision on Brexit and they will make it work... if you allow your Government to give them the chance.THE most Eurosceptic people in Britain are calling on Theresa May to make good on her promise that Brexit means Brexit.The Lincolnshire town’s Tory MP Matt Warman was a Remainer but now advocates a “clean break” from Europe in agreement with 74.9 per cent of his constituents.Office worker Beverly Iles, 67, said: “We should have come straight out. We shouldn’t be still messing about with all this.”Retired council worker Brian Isam, 75, said: “We don’t need soft Brexit. We didn’t pay Europe a penny when we went in and we should not pay them a penny to get out.”THE people of Hull want Theresa May to wave goodbye to the Eurocrats now.In the East Yorkshire city, the leave vote was 68 per cent, although Labour MP Karl Turner was a Remainer.Happy Cakes manager Debbie Scaife, 56, said uncertainty had driven up the price of ingredients.She added: “Mrs May, I call on you to do this for us now.“The British public voted to leave. They didn’t want five years of hell.”Retailer Vicky Paddey, 37, said: “I voted for Brexit and I’m proud to say that — it was what people wanted then and they still want it now. If we end up with a soft Brexit, a lot of these shops in this city centre will not survive it.”IN the North East, some impatient voters are calling for dithering Mrs May to go.Voters in Gateshead went 56.8 per cent in favour of leaving in 2016, against the wishes of Labour MP Ian Mearns.Florist Dawn Athey, 41, said: “I think Theresa May should resign.“She’s not the person I thought she was going to be.“I think she’s scared of being the Prime Minister who’s going to take us out of the EU.”And Jude Ditchburn, 51, from Gateshead, said: “I think she is betraying the country and not doing what people want.FORMER Tory Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan is a leading Remoaner — but in her Leicestershire constituency people want to get on with Brexit.The area voted 50.1 per cent in favour of leaving the EU.Brexit backer Andrew Cooper, 56, said: “They are dragging their feet, the people have voted for this and they need to do what the people asked them to do.”Cedric Hewitt, 90, said: “I think Theresa May ought to get her finger out and get on with it. It’s what the British people wanted.”And David Greasley, 85, a former quality control engineer, said: “I voted out and simply want out.”HARD Brexit opponent and Conservative MP Anna Soubry wants Britain to be shackled with a customs union.Now, they want her party to carry out their wishes.Ray James, 82, and Elsie James, 80, said: “We think the Government are failing to get things sorted. It is taking a long, long time and no people thought it would take this long.”John Wilson, 68, said the Government was clueless on disentangling from the single market. “It has become a shambles,” he added.TOTNES MP Sarah Wollaston switched sides during the referendum campaign and became a Remainer.But she is out of step with her Devon constituency, where 53.9 per cent voted in favour of leaving the EU.Christine Williams, 64, said she was disappointed with Dr Wollaston.“I don’t know if I can now vote for her in the next election,” she added.Butcher Chris McCabe, 70, blamed Theresa May for the slow progress.He said: “This is like the Champions League final and we are at half-time.“She still has a chance but she needs to get her team in order so they can go back out and win this.”WHILE the capital was the heartland of Remain, in Bromley, South London, there was a paper-thin majority of 50.6 per cent in favour of staying in the EU. Tory MP Bob Neill is a Remainer.Gardener David Alden, 52, said: “It’s been dragged out for a reason. They know how to grind people down and tire them out. The elites want one thing and try any way to get it. They want to stop Brexit.”Retired software developer Steve Johnson, 58, said: “They are trying to come up with these fudges — ways to try to renege on the will of the people without outwardly doing so.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Endangered not only by parliamentarians who never really accepted the referendum result, but by the Government’s negotiating approach, which risks delivering an exit from the EU which fails to deliver the control Britons voted for.When, on June 23, 2016, 17.4million people went to the polls to vote for Britain to chart a new course for itself outside of the European Union, they would never have imagined that, almost two years on, Parliament would still be debating whether to keep this country as — essentially — a non-voting member of the EU.Or that their government would still not have set out a detailed blueprint for this country’s relationship with the EU once we have left. So what has gone wrong and who is to blame?There are TWO BASIC RULES of negotiation. Know what you want and do not go into a negotiation unless you are prepared to walk away.Theresa May’s government has FAILED BOTH OF THESE TESTS.Even now, the Government can not say what it wants Britain’s customs arrangements with the EU to be after Brexit. Instead, we’ll have to wait for two working groups to report back before the Cabinet makes up its mind.This failure to know what it is trying to achieve has hobbled Britain in these negotiations — and handed the initiative to the hardliners in the European Commission. Mrs May must take the blame for this.She should never have triggered Article 50, the two-year process for leaving the EU, until she had a clear and precise idea of what she wanted the exit deal to look like.It has also meant that, in the absence of clear UK aims, those conducting the negotiations have treated the whole thing as a damage-limitation exercise.As the Brexit Secretary David Davis, who has been sidelined in the talks in favour of the civil servant Olly Robbins, complains in private, the civil service is not suited to negotiating.It struggles to deal with European chief negotiator Michel Barnier’s take-it-or-leave-it tactics.But the biggest mistake has been the failure to rigorously prepare for no deal. Mrs May used to emphasise that “no deal is better than a bad deal”.But she has never followed through on that rhetoric. There has been no big national effort to get this country as ready as it could be to walk away from the talks.There is plenty of blame to go round for this. The Treasury — aided by the Chancellor Philip Hammond — has refused to make planning for no deal a priority.Why? Because it feared if there was a plan for no deal, the Brexiteers would end up using it. Better, it thought, to make minimal preparations for it to ensure the UK stayed at the negotiating table.But this got it ALL WRONG. The best way to avoid no deal was to plan for it. For WEAKNESS IS PROVOCATIVE. The EU looks at how unready Britain is to walk away and turns the screw.Would Michel Barnier’s team feel free to be so dismissive about Britain’s proposals if they thought we might simply walk out of the talks, taking our £39billion divorce payment with us?It is worth remembering that a report from the House of Lords, hardly a hotbed of Brexiteer sentiment, concluded that Britain was under no legal obligation to pay ANYTHING AT ALL to the EU on leaving.The Government risks being left with the most unpalatable of choices: No deal or stay in a customs union with the EU and the European Economic Area, leaving Britain as, effectively, a non-voting member of the EU.Senior EU figures think they can do this because they do not see any serious attempt by the UK to properly prepare for no deal.If this country had made preparations for going it alone that were so big they were visible from the other side of the Channel, the EU would be engaging in the negotiations in a far more constructive manner and Britain would be on course to secure a much better deal.Leave-supporting Cabinet ministers can not escape their share of the blame for this, either.They should have been far more assertive and pushed for serious no deal planning.They should have insisted that Cabinet was updated every fortnight on Britain’s preparedness to walk away without a deal.They should have demanded that the Government had serious and credible contingency plans to deal with disruption to cross-Channel trade. They should have told Mrs May they would resign if Hammond would not provide the funds necessary to make no deal planning a reality.But there is, as the minutes of the Brexit Inner Cabinet’s most recent meeting make clear, another reason why “EU ministers had no fear of no deal”.They “observed the UK Parliament and prominent Remainers, who had formed a cross-party alliance against Brexit, and thought there was no chance of no deal”.Too many MPs voted for a referendum on our EU membership, then were not prepared to genuinely accept the result when they lost. Too many Tories were prepared to stand at last year’s General Election on a manifesto of leaving the single market and the customs union that they were not actually committed to. That is not being straight with the voters.One of the other reasons EU ministers are not worried about no deal is Mrs May’s loss of the Tory majority in that snap election.Ever since Britain voted for Brexit, the EU has feared the emergence of an alternative economic model on its doorstep.It worried Britain might become a hyper-competitive, low-tax economy 26 miles off its coastline.They expected that Britain would respond to no deal by slashing taxes and regulation to make up for the failure to strike a trade deal with the EU. This gave the EU an incentive to come to an agreement with us.But when the Tory majority disappeared, so did this fear. It is clear this hung parliament does not have the stomach for such a course.Indeed, Mr Hammond said in Germany in January that we would change our “economic model” if we could not get a good trade deal, then took that threat off the table in a visit to France the month after the election. He, unhelpfully, told the French press we would keep up the European economic model even after Brexit.The next big British mistake has been its handling of the Irish border issue. The history of Northern Ireland meant this subject needed to be treated with care. A return to every vehicle being stopped would clearly have been a recipe for trouble.But Britain should never have agreed in December that no new physical infrastructure at the border meant there could not even be number plate recognition cameras.The decision to rule these out has made it far harder to use technology to try to solve the border issues and has been grist to the mill of those who want to use Northern Ireland as a device to keep the whole of the UK in a customs union and “high alignment” with the EU and unable to strike comprehensive free-trade deals with other countries.The Government now finds itself urging the EU to accept a UK-wide “backstop” in an attempt to try to get beyond the Irish border issue knowing that the EU will break off trade talks before they have really begun if there is not progress on this.This backstop, though, is not a good deal for the UK. It would see Britain stuck in a customs union with the EU and following all of Brussels’ rules on goods, yet with no say in making them. It would provide a trade solution for goods, where the EU sells £135billion more to us than we do to them, but not for services, where we sell £92billion more to them.In these circumstances, would the EU really be rushing to complete a trade deal with us? Of course not. It would be in their interest to drag things out, knowing that the backstop would remain in place.If the House of Commons votes for the House of Lords amendment to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU or to take no deal off the table, it will weaken Britain’s negotiating position still further.It will make it almost inevitable that the only deal Brussels is prepared to offer Britain would leave this country as, essentially, a non-voting member of the EU.The Government has made many mistakes in its handling of these negotiations. But this is no excuse for Parliament to compound these errors.MPs should reject these amendments today and the House of Lords should respect the will of the elected House of Commons when the bill returns to it.Then, the Government should get its act together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A Brexit that leaves it half in, half out and subject to EU rules it has no say over would be a disaster but that’s what seeking a deal at any price will lead to.As one of Britain’s many friends abroad, please accept my assurance that you don’t need a customs union to prosper.Without being in a customs union with Europe, and without any free trade deal with it, Australia does nearly $100billion a year in trade with Europe.In the two years of my prime minister-ship, Australia finalised free trade deals with our three biggest export markets: China, Japan and South Korea.So my advice to Britain is: Stop fretting! It IS possible to trade successfully under the WTO rules which already govern 55 per cent of Britain’s exports and it IS possible to do good deals with your main trading partners once you are free to do so, as Australia’s experience abundantly demonstrates.Let’s say, out of spite, the EU refuses to offer Britain a satisfactory bargain.Britain already imports goods from Europe free of tariffs and quotas. Britain already recognises European standards and credentials. Just declare that you will continue to do so.Trade from Europe to Britain would be absolutely free. And even if the Europeans — in an attempt to hurt Britain that would actually damage them — apply the same tariffs to Britain as they do to the US, the fall in the Pound would make British exports at least as competitive in Europe as they are now.Britain should still be the best place from which to export to Europe or to service Europe — because it has the freest markets, a can-do culture and will no longer have EU officials trying to harmonise away its competitive advantage.No new Brussels directives will apply in the UK. British courts will no longer be subject to European ones. And Britain need no longer admit everyone with an EU passport.Importantly, Britain will be able to strike trade deals with anyone it chooses without waiting for 27 other countries to sign up too.The coming Britain-Australia Free Trade Agreement should mean a dramatic increase in trade opportunities between our two countries without disadvantaging anyone else.First, there should be no tariffs or quotas on any goods traded between our two countries — there should be no exceptions, no carve outs, nothing. And second, there should be full recognition of each country’s credentials and standards.Because Australia and Britain are like-minded countries with similar systems and comparable standards of living, there should be no need for tortuous negotiation and labyrinthine detail.After all, Brit and Australian workers enjoy similar protections in the workplace: So why should they need elaborate protections against each other?Britain and Australia have comparable attitudes to job qualifications and product and service standards, so why should British rules be insufficient for Australia and vice versa?And Britons and Australians already have more than 200 years’ experience of each other, so why not allow them more freely to travel and work in each other’s country?This could be a template for the trade deals Britain could swiftly do with New Zealand and Singapore.On a similar basis, Britain could seek to join NAFTA, (North American Free Trade Agreement) which could become the North Atlantic Free Trade Area — and perhaps open to other free market economies seeking to escape the regulatory restraints and statism of the EU.Brexit could begin a process leading to genuinely freer global trade, rather than protectionist trade blocs.Brexit is a wonderful opportunity for Britain and the wider world — if only British leaders are prepared to make the most of it.So go for it Britain, for all our sakes!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An endless, choking diet of documentaries, live events, lectures, news items and outright bollockings, from the BBC, all to celebrate the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote.Not one of which had as much impact as Love Island’s “Girl Power” task on ITV2, involving super-hero capes, bikinis, large items of fruit and narrator Iain Stirling explaining: “The girls will squish melons with their bums. Slowest girl to crush her melon is out of the contest.”Just part of the reason I adore a show which pricks pomposity and political correctness like ­nothing else on British television and is dedicated to no other purpose than entertaining its viewers. That’s the ideal, anyway.The reality’s been a bit more disappointing, so far, probably due to the excessive hype and sense of deja vu with contestants on either half of the gender divide.Both operate a squad rotation system, of course, but among the main players on the blokes’ side, we have painfully shy ­doctor Alex, with all the presence of a fire extinguisher, Jack who “got his teeth in Turkey”, possibly by ripping them from a feral mountain goat’s mouth, and this year’s comedy figure Niall, who’s “an investment for the future”, a bit like Betamax video tapes, and “multi-layered”, like a landfill site.Click here to play our Love Island games - and win a £10,000 holiday for you and three friendsThere’s the compulsory personal trainer, as well, of course — Adam, who seems to have the run of the females, plus strong silent type Wes and fluffy-haired Eyal, pronounced “Eeeeh-al”, “Oooh-all”, or just “Aaaah-sole”, if you prefer.Quite the ­profound one, is Eyal, forever banging on about “auras” and his spirituality while insisting: “I want to find someone here with depth.”A claim which, surely, represents the very height of human optimism given the most profound question all of the girls were asking last week was: “Where’s your head at?”In Kendall’s case, it was “literally all over the place”. One of her eyes was in Majorca, another in Ibiza and her ­forehead was somewhere in the Cote d’Azur. She’s gone though now, leaving, among significant others: Samira, Georgia, Rosie, super- manipulative Hayley and Laura, a former air stewardess who’s ­covered in more make-up than the giraffe in a theatre ­production of The Lion King.Most of the hype, however, has centred around the ­presence of Dani Dyer, the daughter of EastEnders actor Danny Dyer. But you knew that already, didn’t you, possibly because you read it in the paper and possibly because you saw her perform exactly the same big reveal on ITV2’s Survival Of The Fittest a couple of months ago. A doubling up that blows my mind, frankly.Because you expect hit shows to be copied by other fringe channels.What you don’t expect is ITV2 to abuse the basic law of ­supply and demand by copying its own format. A move that doesn’t help Love Island at all. It stops it being an event, in fact, and just makes viewers think this sort of crap is on all year.Personally, I think that’s a shame. Love Island genuinely deserves to be a huge success again. Not only is it one of the funniest and most UN-PC shows on TV, it’s also a series that can actually make you feel glad to be old and half-crippled by your medical complaints, rather than the youthful insecurity and stupidity which has gripped this bunch, who really did surpass themselves, on Friday.Georgia: “What do you think of Brexit?”Hayley: “What’s that?”“We’re leaving the EU so things like welfare and, like, things we trade with would all be cut down.”“So that means we wouldn’t have any trees?”“Cheese?” “No, trees.” “Oh.”Emmeline Pankhurst, your work here on Earth was not in vain.(Love Island, ITV2, 9pm).HAVING discovered Danny Dyer is the rightful heir to the English throne, BBC1 really should’ve knocked it on the head with Who Do You Think You Are?Until such time as one of the researchers can prove Danniella Westbrook is the rightful heir to the Romanov dynasty and the Imperial Highness of all Russia.So they must have been flipping cartwheels at HQ when they discovered the great-great-grandmother of this week’s guest, ex-Corrie star Michelle Keegan had her birth certificate signed by registrar Emmeline Pankhurst, leader of the Suffragettes.A much greater honour, in the Beeb’s book, than three wise men and some shepherds turning up at your crib, but a detail that was probably as dull as ditch water for most viewers.The far more interesting thing to emerge during the hour, I thought, was Michelle’s own staggering ignorance of life, the world and everything.She had, for instance, no idea where Genoa was and gave a genuinely staggering response when a local historian told her: “By 1940 your family will have been torn apart, like every other family in Gibraltar, at the time.”“Why?”(Pause) “The Second World War.”You wondered then if the show would ever get round to revealing if the plank gene had entered her family tree through the maternal or paternal line.Then Michelle Skyped her mum and, waving a frothy cup of coffee at the screen, said: “Guess where I am. I’ll give you a clue, I’m drinking a cappuccino . . . ”“France?”Mystery solved.Loose Women, Russell Brand, with Janet Street-Porter: “Everyone is so beautiful here.”Good Morning Britain, roly-poly Piers Morgan: “When I grew up, I loved Frosties and it never did me any harm.”And Love Island, Samira: “I can sing, I can dance, I can act.” (Bursts into song).She can’t sing.NEVER, in all its ten-series history, has ITV’s love lift been quite as badly needed as it was on Saturday’s brilliant, one-off Take Me Out special for the “over-50s”.A slightly generous description, I thought, given the 30 game old birds looked like they had the combined age of the Pyramids.The fire still burns down below, though, evidently, as a queue of lights remained on for George, the midget Zumba teacher with the wooden teeth, Lawrence, the Billy Connolly lookalike from Ibiza, and even “bouncing Bill”, the ex-policeman, above, who emerged from Paddy McGuinness’s love lift gasping for breath and telling the women: “Every night, when I go to sleep, I like to think I’ve made someone’s life better. What would your motto be?”Fingers crossed, I’d imagine.Lee Dixon: “I like Alexander-Arnold because he gives you half a goal.”Ian Wright: “Harry Kane is still getting back to where he is.”And Glenn Hoddle: “By the time the World Cup starts, today will be history.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In 1883 which luxury train service ran between Paris and the city now called Istanbul?” Alice: “The Eurostar.”Ben Shephard: “The former Labour MP Ed Balls married which politician in 1998?” Phil: “Theresa May.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “The plumage of what flightless bird was used as a medieval helmet decoration?” Geoff: “Eagle.”And Ben Shepherd: “How many of the eight planets in our solar system have the letter A in their name?”Harj: “I think the answer to that is one.

Heres what we know so far...The entire debate covers two days of intense debate and last minute deals over June 12 and 13.The wranglings on June 12 lasted more than six hours.The government is understood to have accepted the first two parts of rebel MP Dominic Grieves amendment - which would hand Parliament much more control over the Brexit negotiations.Ministers are conceding that within seven days of Mrs May agreeing a Brexit deal, it must be voted on in the Commons, and that if there if there is no deal by November 30, the Government needs approval from MPs on how to proceed.This would effectively remove no-deal as a realistic option, with Parliament effectively in charge of negotiations.The government effectively voted in favour of taking out a Lords amendment that would have removed the power of ministers to decide when retained EU law can be challenged in court.Two Tory MPs - Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry - voted against the government.The entire debate marks the start of the governments attempts to undo the majority of changes put forward by the House of Lords regarding the EU Withdrawal Bill.Dominic Grieve has said Parliament would have structured input into what happened next to avoid a crisis.But is not believed that the government are willing to agree to Mr Grieves call for MPs to take control of negotiations as a last resort.More crunch votes are expected on the customs union tomorrow.BBCs Laura Kuenssberg urged caution on interpreting the meaningful vote outcome, tweeting: govt source says only agreement is to keep talking, no actual concessions have been agreed, this might be done for tonight, but it is not over.Dr Phillip Lee, who earlier resigned as Justice Minister over the vote, has tweeted his delight that the government had agreed to introduce an amendment to the bill which will give Parliament the voice I always wanted it to have in the Brexit process.If she makes the changes the rebels are demanding, Theresa Mays negotiating hand in Brussels will be weaker because the EU will know we cannot threaten to walk away from their negotiations and go it alone as MPs are likely to reject it in a vote.What we know so far:The second big vote comes tomorrow (Wednesday), when MPs decide on an amendment requiring the government to report on its progress in negotiating membership of a customs union with the EU.May has a working majority of just 13, including the Democratic Unionist party, meaning in theory, just seven Tory MPs need to switch sides to cause a defeat.Principal interest will focus on how many Labour MPs defy Jeremy Corbyn and vote in favour of keeping Britain in the single market through membership of the European Economic Area. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Without that ultimate weapon we are certain to get a poor deal.The Prime Minister cannot accept what a small handful of Remainers determined to stop Brexit are demanding.As she has rightly said, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.The people said leave, not leave when the EU gives us permission.The EU Withdrawal Bill, which MPs voted on this week, is about ensuring legal certainty at our point of departure.Jeremy Corbyn voted against the Government on this key bill, cynically trying to frustrate the Brexit process for his own political ends.If Conservatives do not demonstrate discipline in support of Theresa May on this, then we risk letting him into power.The Government has already said the EU Withdrawal Bill can be framed so as to give Parliament a vote on the final outcome, but without blocking the UK’s departure even without a deal.The Bill will go back to the House of Lords on Monday, and is likely then to return to the House of Commons.We need to get this out of the way, because it is 14 months on from triggering Article 50 and we still have not discussed the vital trade relationship between the UK and the EU.This is because the EU Commission deliberately set out to ensnare the UK in a tortuous bureaucratic process designed to leave us in the weakest position, bound to the EU as some sort of vassal state — as a rule-taker.In this, the EU has been emboldened by the appalling behaviour of the unelected House of Lords, which made it clear they want to reverse the result of the referendum. One peer even spoke arrogantly of now bringing the British people to heel.You only need to have watched as the EU’s negotiators have gratuitously and remorselessly set out not just to be difficult but, it has become clear, to humiliate us.For example, their refusal to agree to our continuing involvement in the Galileo satellite project, despite the fact that we have invested heavily in it, demonstrates how their behaviour has been calculated to offend.Even the UK’s offer of defence intelligence co-operation, which the EU needs, was brushed aside.That the EU is now strutting like the school bully should not surprise us, because of its ideological commitment to the European project at all costs.Yet, for all their bluster, this masks a weakness.The EU is deeply worried the UK will leave the EU and become a serious trade competitor, thus not only damaging the EU’s trading position but encouraging those in the EU who oppose this centralised, protectionist behemoth.We have reached a critical moment in the Brexit process. Because of the EU’s inflexibility, the Government has been forced to make concessions in the hope of discussing that all-important trade relationship.This has left many of us concerned that the process has been too one-sided.The UK has been behaving as a friend who wants an amicable divorce, while the EU has behaved like an opponent who wishes to impose their will and force the UK to repent what they believe is the folly of Brexit.That is why the UK needs now to change its negotiating stance, once the Brexit bill is passed.Too often it seems as though it is the UK which negotiates as a supplicant — despite the reality that, as the EU’s largest trade partner and the fifth largest economy in the world, with the world’s fourth most potent defence forces, the UK is deserving of much more respect from the EU.After all, there is a great deal at stake for the EU if these negotiations go wrong.There are many among the EU 27 who, like us, are growing weary of the EU’s arrogance. After all, it is many of them who stand to lose jobs if we fail to reach a trade arrangement.The EU Council meeting later this month has now become critical. It is there we should say that, notwithstanding any ongoing issues concerning the Irish border, our requirement is we move now to negotiate our post-Brexit trade relationship.If they refuse, and want instead to continue their border demands, then we must have the resolve to leave the table.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So far all I’ve come up with is Iggle Piggle, from TV’s In The Night Garden.I think negotiating Brexit would be a stretch for the friendly blue woollen creature with the red Mohawk.But maybe I’ve got him wrong, underestimated his abilities. He has a bell in his left foot. Theresa May seems to have a brain in her left foot. Given the choice, maybe I’d take the kid with the bell.We are in chaos. Not because we voted for Brexit, far from it. The economy is doing well. The sky has not fallen in. Investment up, employment hitting record levels, inflation down.No, the problem is solely a consequence of our Government. Right now we don’t know exactly what deals have been done with the rump of Remainers within the Conservative Party.One moment we’re told the Prime Minister has caved in to their demands. Next minute she hasn’t. Nobody knows quite what to believe.She is tip-toeing between the two sides solely to stay in power. And she has to be told: It isn’t working. It sends out a message to the people we are negotiating with that we haven’t a clue what’s going on.That policy is formulated on the hoof. In fact, it’s not policy at all, just inept fire-fighting. Inept because the flames are spreading — and as a result, our negotiating position becomes weaker by the hour.Some will argue May can only play the cards she has been dealt. That she has a minority Government and a split in her own party.Well, sure. But then, to a considerable degree, she dealt the cards herself. She called an election a year ago expecting to get a huge majority.I could have told her she would lose, if she’d asked. But she didn’t ask me, she asked some other numbnuts instead. This holy mess is of her making.Britain voted to leave the EU. Not to stay in bits of it. Not to remain constrained by the EU’s regulations. The Remainers don’t like that?Don’t care. You lost the argument — so shut up for a while. Or work to get us the best deal we can, outside the customs union.We need to be clear to the EU negotiators that we will happily take a no deal Brexit. They don’t want that — and a tough line will make them respond. If it doesn’t — fine, no deal is still much better than a bad deal.The EU is falling apart, largely for the reasons that convinced us to leave. Bullying, dictatorial, corrupt, undemocratic.We need a leader who can exploit their manifest weaknesses. A lot — perhaps a majority — of European people are on our side.That leader isn’t Theresa May. It needs to be someone within the Tories who is A. a Leave voter and B. has a bit of charisma and nous.I don’t really care who, right now, David Davis, Boris Johnson, Priti Patel, Michael Gove. But ABM — Anyone But May.It is not the EU that is hampering our exit strategy. It is our own Govern­ment. It’s time for Theresa to say: “That’s it: I’m out.”Now, quiz fans, here’s a question for you. What do Terry and Andraya possess that may have helped them come first and second?Jet-powered roller skates? Performance- enhancing drugs? Nope.They were both born with male bodies. And they both competed as boys until very recently.But according to the growing trend, they are now able to identify as girls without question. And so are allowed to compete against girls.And that’s what happens. They win because of biology.SHOULD the Royal Family be allowed to get their baps out? An important constitutional point.Meghan turned up for a royal engagement with her shoulders uncovered. And many people thought this was “inappropriate”.

Well done, Shriver.IN Cretins Corner this week are the libtards criticising President Trump for his attempts to make peace with North Korea.Six months ago these same people were screaming that Trump was leading us all to death and destruction by threatening Kim Jong-un.Now he’s accused of cosying up to a horrible dictator.Truth is, he’s played it brilliantly. Acting tough brought the porky dog-muncher to the negotiating table.And now we have at least a chance of peace in the world’s second most dangerous area (after the Middle East, natch).Barack Obama was bunged a Nobel Peace Prize for, essentially, doing nothing, by the liberals who run the awards.How about one for The Donald for actually achieving something?IS Sadiq Khan going mad?The Mayor of London has demanded that Wikipedia must “close the gender gap” on its entries. Just 17 per cent of biographies on Wiki are about women, apparently.What’s it got to do with you, you bumptious midget?As someone cleverly tweeted, just zero per cent of Imams at Britain’s mosques are female – perhaps they should close the gender gap a little too.Listen Sadiq, just build a few more homes in the capital and stop young ethnic minority people macheteing or machine gunning each other to death.When you’ve sorted that out, mate, then maybe you can start worrying about American online publications.Listen, mate. That’s our money you’re spending. He could have done that trip for sixty quid on the train.And we’d have thrown in a fiver for a packet of cashews and some Red Bull.APPARENTLY, young people are getting thicker.Their average IQ is declining year on year.If you follow the graph to its natural conclusion, by about 2028 they will have an IQ of zero.They’ll be like the Viz character Jellyhead, who had lime jelly between her ears and just lay on the floor all day.They’re already about the level of another Viz character, Terry F***witt.

So people will stand firm on this”.Tory Brexiteers hit back at the rebels to accuse them of a power grab and trying to rewrite Britain’s constitution.The boss of the hardline European Reform Group Jacob Rees-Mogg told The Sun: “If they want to mandate the PM to change her position they have to have a vote of confidence and get a new PM.“And that is the long established constitutional position.“I am keen for scrutiny but you need to observe the separation of powers between the executive and legislature.”Energy Minister Claire Perry tried to reassure the Tory rebels to insist Mrs May will not let them down.The minister said: “The Prime Minister is a woman who keeps her word”.As the EU looked on yesterday at the high stakes Commons drama, some of its leaders admitted they were struggling to keep up with its twists and turns.Dutch PM Mark Rutte confessed: “Of course, I’m a keen observer of what happens in London, so yes I’m following the votes.“I try to make sense of it, it’s not always easy.”Tory former minister Anna Soubry said she would also be voting for the EEA amendment.She told the Commons: “I will be voting for the EEA amendment because I believe, as I have said many, many times in this place, of the value of the single market.”Ms Soubry urged MPs to advocate the case for immigration and “suck it up”, saying: “Suck it up: there is no alternative that has been advanced in this place other than the customs union, the single market.“Let’s grab it, let’s do it and move on.”Last night local Tory association chiefs warned of repercussions if MPs defied Theresa May over the Brexit bill.One official in Jonathan Djanogly’s Huntingdon constituency — which voted 53.4 per cent to leave — said their members were torn over his Remainer stance.They described the situation as a “nightmare” saying there had been numerous calls for his deselection while he was branded a “liar” by angry party activists.However, the official said the constituency was split with many members and officials supportive of him after he increased his majority at last year’s General Election.In Heidi Allen’s South Cambridgeshire constituency — which voted 38.4 per cent to Leave — another party official said she was “assured” the MP had done what she “considered to be right” and there was unlikely to be consequences. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In Scotland they would no doubt call it a \"rammy\".Stunts like this succeed because the TV cameras capture it all, the MP shown the red card is pursued all over SW1 for interviews and an obscure issue that might not have been reported gets huge coverage. From my vantage point high up in the Commons press gallery behind the speaker\u0027s chair, from where I\u0027ve witnessed countless ejections and walkouts in more than 35 years reporting parliament, it was clear that the SNP\u0027s 35 MPs knew exactly what was coming.As soon as their leader was given his marching orders by Mr Bercow, they all followed him out, some of them making what looked like obscene gestures towards the speaker and the group of 13 Scottish Conservatives who sit opposite them in the chamber and goad them constantly. Amid uproar in the chamber, Joanna Cherry, a QC and a leading figure at the Scottish Bar, left making derogatory hand movements towards the speaker with her Commons papers, in a gesture and with a disdain that would earn her a long suspension from the courtrooms of Scotland, I imagine.Chris Law, Angus MacNeil and Tommy Sheppard also appeared to be shouting aggressively at the Scottish Conservative MPs.But the most aggressive of the SNP MPs as they all marched out of the chamber, perhaps not surprisingly, was Mhairi Black, who was pointing angrily and shouting at the Scottish Tory MPs as if she was challenging them to a fight. The SNP drama began after an entertaining spat between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. The Labour leader began the pair\u0027s exchanges by mercilessly mocking Boris Johnson\u0027s suggestion at a dinner last week that Donald Trump should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations.But the prime minister ended their clash with a hilarious gag at the expense of Mr Corbyn over his \"LabourLive\" event, which has been ridiculed over slow ticket sales, claiming the headline act at the gig was \"John McDonnell and the magic numbers\".Then it was Mr Blackford\u0027s turn. First he asked a rather long-winded question which ended with a demand that the Commons should sit in private. Really?So let me get this right. The SNP leader wanted the Commons to sit in private to help the party\u0027s case for Scotland\u0027s case to be heard.No, me neither. Mr Bercow, who was clearly enjoying being at the centre of attention once again - TV pictures showed him grinning during his clash with Mr Blackford - told him he would allow a vote on sitting in private at the end of PMQs but not in the middle of the session.A clerk then helpfully supplied the speaker with a document showing a standing order, number 43, for him to quote to MPs.A distinguished scribbler sitting next to me in the gallery - an acclaimed author these days - thought Mr Bercow was losing control. I\u0027m not so sure about that.But when he did order him out, at first Mr Blackford sat rooted to the green bench below the gangway on the opposition side of the chamber.Strangely, the new Sergeant at Arms, Kamal El-Hajji, who hours earlier had defended Mr Bercow against his critics and claimed he is the victim of a witch-hunt, was not in his usual seat just feet away from the SNP benches.Unusually, for this PMQs the Sergeant at Arms\u0027 seat was occupied by one of his female deputies, slight in stature and no match physically for Mr Blackford.But after a few moments, Mr Blackford eventually lifted himself off the bench and walked slowly towards the Bar of the House, where these days female government whips stand in a line. Wisely, they parted to allow him to leave and then the mass exodus followed behind their leader, with the noise levels in the chamber now excessive even by the raucous standards of PMQs.Was it worth it? Five SNP MPs with questions on the order paper lost their chance to quiz the prime minister. But they won\u0027t mind that. Their stunt has ensured them far more publicity than worthy questions about Scottish fishers, crofters or RBS bank closures.The SNP, it should be said, has some form on this type of stunt. Back in 1988, Alex Salmond was thrown out and suspended for five days for \"disorderly conduct\".John McDonnell, now shadow chancellor, was thrown out in 2009 for seizing the mace in a row over Heathrow expansion. (He wasn\u0027t the first to go for this offence - Michael Heseltine grabbed it in a heated Commons flare-up in 1976).Dennis Skinner holds the record for parliamentary red cards. He has been thrown out six times, most recently in 2016 for calling then prime minister David Cameron \"Dodgy Dave\". Back in 1984, Mr Skinner was thrown out for calling David Owen a \"pompous sod\". Asked to withdraw, he withdrew the word \"pompous\". In 1994, he called Tory minister John Gummer \"a little squirt\" and a year later accused John Major\u0027s government of a \"crooked deal\".The Tories\u0027 Commons partners the Democratic Unionists have form too. I well remember Ian Paisley being thrown out in 1993 and shouting to his then deputy, Peter Robinson, to join him, bellowing: \"Come on, Peter!\"In 2013, the DUP\u0027s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds was thrown out for accusing the then Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers of \"falsehoods\". How times have changed. He showers Theresa May\u0027s ministers with praise these days.Parties walking out of the chamber is not new, either. In 2006, Nick Clegg led a walkout by Liberal Democrat MPs in a row with then speaker Michael Martin over - yes - an EU referendum, and, as the SNP MP Stephen Gethins pointed out later, Donald Dewar led a walkout of Scottish Labour MPs in the 1980s. At the end of this PMQs, Mr Bercow drew attention to a baby - belonging to Labour MP Clive Lewis - in the gallery up above the benches on the Conservative side of the chamber.\"For all the turbulence and discord of today\u0027s proceedings, the little baby who has been observing them has been a model of impeccable behaviour from start to finish,\" he said, prompting MPs to applaud."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-papers-newspapers_4335531.jpg?20180613220350 ","title":"wpp chairman we are in big time listening mode","story":"Could this, one day, sprout into a challenger for WPP\u0027s crown as the global advertising king?\"Martin has a lot of knowledge about our company, but that knowledge has a life-span,\" says Quarta.\"In terms of people saying that he will damage WPP - I don\u0027t think so.\"He made a statement where he referred to his company as a peanut compared to WPP.\"I am quite sure he understands his responsibilities under his contract [with WPP].

The party is calling for a \u0026pound350m loan fund to replace dangerous cladding on over 100 privately owned tower blocks to “remove the alibi for private owners who have not made their blocks safe”. The Shadow Housing minister warns that without strict penalties for owners that don’t comply -including seizing blocks with unsafe cladding- then families will continue to be forced to live in unsafe homes. One year on from the fire which killed 72 people remediation work is finally starting to be done on many council and housing association owned blocks, there is little evidence of action on privately-owned buildings. Many private owners claim this is due to the cost.  But under Labour’s scheme private block owners who are unable to fund the replacement of dangerous cladding will be eligible to apply for a repayable loan to cover the costs. Conservative Ministers still don’t know how many privately-owned tower blocks there are in England, the total number of private blocks with dangerous Grenfell-style cladding, though 138 have been found so far, and they refuse to publish data on the number of private blocks that have replaced this cladding. The Tories have also failed to put in place powers to enforce the testing or making safe of suspect private blocks and are letting private building owners pass on the costs to residents.

The stony-faced Prime Minister stood in virtual silence for 20 seconds while her Foreign Secretary chuckled during a vintage edition of the weekly clash. Labour\u0027s leader mocked the PM over a leaked recording of Boris mocking her Brexit plan and saying there would be a meltdown. The Foreign Secretary also called for Donald Trump to be put in charge of Brexit talks because actually you might get somewhere. Mr Corbyn asked Mrs May mockingly: Did she do as the Foreign Secretary suggested and ask him to take over the Brexit negotiations? The Tory leader stood up to reply - but no reply came. As Boris tittered, Labour MPs seized the brief delay to unleash a chorus of jeers.  Ashen-faced, she glared, smoothed over her papers and stared upwards as she tried to start her sentence until Speaker John Bercow called order. When she regained her composure she accused Labour of being the party that is divided - and accused Mr Corbyn of not understanding her plans himself. She explained her backup plan for customs - which could extend EU rules to 2022 (see below) - saying: Let me be very clear about what the backstop is. But Mr Corbyn, speaking at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions, remarked: I\u0027m not really sure if it’s a backstop or a backslide she’s talking about here. And Labour MPs jeered the words of the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator: Backstop means backstop!  It comes amid a Tory row after Mrs May avoided defeat in a key vote last night on her EU Withdrawal Bill. She managed to persuade Tory rebels not to ask for a meaningful vote - which could\u0027ve stopped a no-deal Brexit - by offering a compromise. But Tory Remainers and Brexiteers were in a furious dispute this morning about exactly what that compromise meant, and whether it could give Brussels negotiators the upper hand.  Speaking at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions, Mr Corbyn said Hard Brexit-backing Boris Johnson inhabited a parallel universe and questioned when the PM would publish a long-awaited White Paper with the next steps of her plan. He called on her to delay a long-awaited EU summit this month while the government decides what its position actually is. But Mrs May said there was never due to be a Brexit deal at the summit - and hinted the White Paper will be published in July. She said only the Tories would deliver on the 52% vote of the British people to leave the EU - and Labour were trying to frustrate Brexit. Jabbing her finger at Labour, she added: If he wants to talk about differences of opinion I’ll tell him what division really is.  Division is members of the Labour Party circulating instruction manuals on how to deselect all the Labour MPs. Quoting Boris, however, Mr Corbyn shot back: You’ve got to face the fact there may now be a meltdown. He added: Meanwhile, the economy is weakening and industry is increasingly alarmed at the sheer ineptitude of her Government.  How much more damage is the Prime Minister going to do to the country before she realises the important thing is to get a deal for the people of this country, not one to appease the clashing giant egos of her Cabinet?  Mrs May ended on a joke about Labour\u0027s reportedly poorly-sellling music and politics festival this weekend. I\u0027ve heard the right honourable gentleman is trying to organise a music festival, Labour Live, she mocked. I’ll pass over the fact it’s going to have a solidarity tent which obviously won’t have any Labour MPs within it. The headline acts are the Shadow Chancellor and The Magic Numbers - just about sums them up! The EU has a customs union. This means all 28 member states can trade with each other without any checks or duties on goods. Theresa May has said Britain will leave this after December 2020, so she can sign trade deals with non-EU countries. But officials have warned a new UK customs system won\u0027t be ready in time. So they\u0027ve devised a \u0027backstop\u0027 - a backup plan that will carry on some EU customs rules in the UK if there\u0027s no deal. It is designed to stop ports grinding to a halt and Northern Ireland setting up border posts, which could lead to violence. Yet Brexiteers were furious because it had no set end date. In a huge Tory row, they warned it would trap Britain half-in, half-out the EU. After frantic last-minute talks, and threats to quit by Brexit Secretary David Davis, a time limit was put in - December 2021. Yet the government only expects to follow that time limit. It is not legally binding. And the EU poured cold water on it. Britain and the EU also disagree about what the backstop will do. EU plans back in March would have kept Northern Ireland aligned with Brussels customs rules, but Theresa May rejected this because it draws a border between the province and the mainland. So she drew up Britain\u0027s own backstop, which is now being put to the EU for discussion. The UK plan is a temporary customs arrangement allowing totally tariff-free trade between the EU and the whole of the UK. So the UK would carry on being in the EU Customs Union in all but name until December 2021. But the UK also wants to sign new trade deals with nations outside the EU. Britain even wants to implement parts of these deals that don\u0027t relate to the backstop. Brussels has repeatedly said this won\u0027t be possible - so the new plan is setting up for a big battle with the EU. And as time ticks on, the backstop will become less of a Plan B and more of a Plan A. It\u0027ll turn from backstop... to frontstop."},{"url":null,"title":"tasteless housing boss whose grenfell","story":"NewsHousing boss whose Grenfell tenants died throws \u0027tasteless\u0027 fashion book party on fire\u0027s first anniversaryEXCLUSIVE: Kate Davies of Notting Hill Genesis - which lost eight residents in the fire - invited pals to a book launch in the trust\u0027s London office\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomPolitical reporter22:14, 13 JUN 2018Updated22:36, 13 JUN 2018NewsNotting Hill Genesis chief executive Kate Davies was criticised for her timing (Image: @fabrickated/Twitter)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA wealthy social housing chief whose tenants died in Grenfell Tower has been branded “tasteless in the extreme” for throwing a party at her office on the first anniversary of the fire. Notting Hill Genesis chief executive Kate Davies was told to “show some respect” after inviting pals to celebrate her new fashion book on Thursday night - at the same time as a memorial for the 72 who died. Eight residents with Notting Hill Housing, the current trust’s predecessor, died in three Grenfell flats it was using as temporary accommodation last June. Thousands including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will join a memorial walk from 7pm on Thursday near the tower, near the heart of Notting Hill. Ms Davies invited friends to “celebrate” her book with wine, music, networking, and fabric and make-up workshops from 6pm.  Despite being a private event, the launch was due to take place at one of the housing association’s central London offices, a few miles from Grenfell. Notting Hill Genesis confirmed the location - and said Ms Davies was not being charged a room hire fee. Ms Davies\u0027 blog about fashion, which she runs in her spare time between her \u0026pound220,000-a-year job, admitted “I know not everyone can come” adding: “It’s the first anniversary of Grenfell and a number of my friends will be involved in special events in our area.” But urging as many people as possible to come to the “party”, the blog stated: “It is a big day for me and I am very grateful so many have decided to come along.” The Trust defended the “private event” saying it “in no way detracts” from honouring Grenfell victims.  But campaigners who asked to remain anonymous said the timing was “staggering”, “jarring” and “extraordinary”. Kensington MP Emma Dent Coad said: “As a fashion blogger, Kate Davies has a perfect right to launch her book with a party whenever she wishes. “However, as a chief executive of a housing association which owned flats in Grenfell Tower where people died, she should show some respect. “Many local Notting Hill residents are devastated by the anniversary. Her timing is tasteless in the extreme.” Westminster North MP Karen Buck said: “What the chief executive does in her own time is a matter for her. “However, the anniversary of the Grenfell disaster is a very important occasion and, as NHHT tenants died in the fire, I would hope that the organisation is, as a matter of respect, represented at senior level.” Ms Davies’ 220-page book, Making Life More Beautiful, is on sale for \u0026pound14.99 and offers “practical advice on beauty, style and making clothes.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jonestown cult members drank cyanide","story":"NewsJonestown cult ended in mass suicide of 909 as Jim Jones\u0027 devoted followers drank cyanide-laced \"Kool Aid\"WARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENT Religious cult members of the Peoples Temple died in mass murder-suicide after drinking poison at the urging of their leader, the Reverend Jim Jones, in a secluded South American jungle settlement\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsBySteve Myall17:09, 12 JUN 2018Updated23:16, 12 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt was supposed to be Utopia. But it ended in a sickening story of violence and death deep in the South American jungle. A cult leader who once preached peace and equality and railed against the violence of the global nuclear arms race now urged his followers towards death. Jim Jones was found shot in the head lying among the bodies of 909 followers - including women and babies. The 1978 mass suicide was the largest ever single loss of American civilian life in a deliberate act, and remained so until the 9/11 terror attacks.  Followers of Peoples Temple Agricultural Project, better known as Jonestown, had committed mass suicide. Earlier other cult members had butchered congressman Leo Ryan, in an act that Jones ordered, after he arrived in north Guyana to investigate claims people had been held against their will. He had met disciples who begged for his help amid lack of food and a dictatorship regime. Jones feared he was about to be exposed and so ordered Ryan\u0027s death, with several of his entourage also killed. The cult leader then set in motion the plans for mass suicide he had long anticipated. He called his adopted son, also called Jim, at the cult HQ in Georgetown, the largest nearby city, and gave him an order with a terrifying secret meaning.  In a new documentary he recalls: In the early evening I went down to the radio room because my father wanted to talk to me. He says, \u0027We\u0027re going to meet Mr. Fraser\u0027. And that was code for committing revolutionary suicide, and \u0027you need to work out how you guys can meet Mr. Fraser in Georgetown\u0027. I\u0027m like, \u0027What the hell is going on, is there something else we can do?\u0027 Then my father went into a rhetoric: \u0027This is the cause that you have to stand up to, our avenging angels will protect us, and prove things right or make justice happen, but we have to meet Mr. Fraser.\u0027 Terrified about what was happening, Jim and his brothers went to the American Embassy to raise the alarm - but it was already too late. Back at the camp Jones had called a large meeting at the town\u0027s pavilion using the speaker system he often gave propaganda laden speeches over. Deadly cocktail  Meanwhile a cocktail of sedatives and cyanide  had been mixed by 30-year-old camp doctor Lawrence Schacht and flavoured with powdered grape juice flavouring.  The phrase Drinking the Kool-Aid was later born from the Jonestown suicides to mean a person or group who goes along with a doomed or dangerous idea because of peer pressure. The assembled were told it was time to die. The first to take the poison were Ruletta Paul and her one-year-old son Robert. A syringe with its needle removed was used to squirt poison into the infant\u0027s mouth, after which Paul squirted another syringe into her own mouth. Jones ordered mothers with babies to take the poison first and it\u0027s been speculated that it was to make adults more willing to die after their children were dead.  One eye-witness stated that while the poison was squirted in some children\u0027s mouths, there was no panic or emotional outburst and the assembled Temple members looked like they were in a trance. This though was contradicted when a 45 minute audio recording - known as the death tape - emerged revealing cries and screams of children. On the tape Jones could be heard ranting: I tell you, I don\u0027t care how many screams you hear, I don\u0027t care how many anguished cries...death is a million times preferable to 10 more days of this life. If you knew what was ahead of you – if you knew what was ahead of you, you\u0027d be glad to be stepping over tonight. Humble beginnings The cult leader had begun as an American evangelical preacher who was certain the Cold War of the 1970s would bring a nuclear bomb. He created a community in San Francisco, California, where he said his followers would be safe from nuclear fallout. Many of his followers were recovering drug addicts from the black community and he seemed to offer a warm welcome at a time when racial divides were strong. But the authorities started to pay extra interest to his community - called the People\u0027s Temple - and there were stories in the press from disaffected former members of the church. Then almost overnight Jones relocated to Guyana, in South America. Followers - to whom he preached about communism, socialism, the US government, the rich, economic equality and ending childhood hunger- believed he had special powers and followed him to the new planned utopia  One member of the cult who survived the massacre with his children, Jerry Parks, recalled a car journey when what he thought at the time was a miracle happened. He said: My son Dale was driving to school with Jim Jones with two or three cars. The lead car which he was in hit a duck and knocked it to the side of the highway. Jim had him pull over, open the door, got out, walked over and picked the duck up in his hand and Dale says he stroked the duck. Miracle He said he was saying something but he didn\u0027t understand what he was saying and all of a sudden the duck jumps up to his feet on the hand and flies away. That is something to this day we don\u0027t understand how to view it, what to think about it, was it real, was the duck alive, would it have happened anyway? We didn\u0027t think that way at the time, because it was too early on with Jim Jones so we believed that it was the real thing. Jerry says now that he never fully bought into Jones\u0027 hyperbole and suspected disaster was on the horizon the moment he landed in South America.  He said: I knew early on that we were going to die over there. He had backed himself into a corner that he couldn\u0027t get out of and it would soon fall in on him. He said we may have to die for this. But he didn\u0027t mean we\u0027re going to grab guns and stand out there and protect ourselves. \u0027You have to die for it\u0027 means we\u0027re gonna kill ourselves before they get us. New start In South America in the baking heat Jones and his followers built a town housing 1,000 - mainly women and children. But it was not to be a peaceful life as quickly his methods of controlling a community containing those who had begun to doubt their mission became increasingly cruel and driven by paranoia. Residents had their passports collected on arrival and any dissent was treated with brutal beatings or menial tasks as punishment. Members of the cult were forced to sign confessions to theft, abuse and terrorism as a sign of loyalty but in reality they were used to keep the members quiet. Former member Joyce Shaw told the Mirror in 1978 that Jones imposed celibacy on members, telling them he was the only heterosexual in the world but slept with both men and women. Shaw, who had been a member in the US, said: I saw beatings and physical abuse. For discipline people were publicly spanked or beaten with thick sticks. A man who confessed to being a homosexual was stripped, beaten with a rubber hose and made to march around to show his welts.  You could see that he could no longer have functioned as a man. Another man who complained about the celibacy rule was forced to perform humiliating acts in public with a woman who vomited over him. That cured his ardour. Little kids who misbehaved had to box each other, so did elderly people. Word began to leak back to the USA that some residents were being held against their will in the community - which was known as Jonestown - and relatives lobbied their elected representatives for help. Paranoia Jones believed the American Government had it in for him and was terrified he would lose control, so he ordered his brainwashed followers to conduct drills in preparation for a mass suicide. Then, in November 1978, Congressman Leo Ryan decided to visit the community after his interest became aroused when the son of a friend who was a member of the cult was found murdered days after saying he wanted to leave. It was to begin the ball rolling towards a tragic conclusion. By the time Ryan arrived on November 14, Jones\u0027 health had declined, according to survivors, and he was abusing LSD, Quaaludes, stimulants and barbiturates. His once sharp speaking voice was slurred, his eyes were glazed and he was increasingly paranoid. Ambush Ryan was initially refused entry to the town but once inside he was treated to a well-rehearsed musical show designed to show all was happy and well. In fact it would later emerge he had told an aide that he planned to report all was well upon his return to the US. Jones, though, had already decided on his deadly course. Inside the camp several unhappy families approached Ryan asking to come with him when he left, but the numbers were still small in relation to the overall population. On the evening of November 18 the departing Ryan party - along with 30 defectors - assembled at the nearby Port Kaituma airstrip to fly back to Georgetown. They had been joined by Temple loyalist Larry Layton despite the concerns of those leaving who did not trust him.  As the party waited at the airstrip a tractor and trailer appeared and hidden gunmen opened fire - Congressman Ryan, two reporters and an NBC cameraman were killed along with defector Patricia Parks, while several other people were also injured. Congressman Ryan was shot more than 20 times. Jerry Parks was at the airstrip when the shooting happened and recalls in a new Investigation: Discover documentary: I had just fastened my seatbelt and was siting right by the window and I heard the guns going off and the bullets flying and all I could think to say was \u0027my God!\u0027 I heard my mom holler \u0027look at Patty\u0027, my wife. I looked back and she was sat slumped over with the top of her head gone. Larry Layton had shot two people inside the plane but when he tried to shoot Jerry\u0027s son Dale, the gun jammed. The gunmen fled after killing the Congressman and the survivors hid in the jungle until help arrived.  Back at the camp Jones used news of Ryan\u0027s death to speed up the mass suicide telling his followers: The Congressman’s dead … please get us some medication. It’s simple, it’s simple, there’s no convulsions with it, it’s just simple, just please get it before it’s too late. The GDF (Guyana Defense Force) will be here. I tell you get moving, get moving, get moving … The poison took just five minutes to kill. When the army arrived they found a scene of unimaginable devastation with bodies littering the ground around the pavilion. A handful of cult members survived by fleeing into the jungle or hiding. Grover Davis, 79, who was partly deaf, missed the announcement to assemble on the loudspeaker, lay down in a ditch, and pretended to be dead. The children A first body count put the death toll at 400. Only when the bodies were moved was it discovered that children and babies had been murdered and their bodies lay hidden beneath the adult corpses. Plastic cups, Flavor Aid packets, and syringes, some with needles and some without, littered the area where the bodies were found. Jones\u0027 body was found with a self inflicted gunshot to the head. At the cult\u0027s headquarters in Georgetown, cult member Sharon Amos cut the throats of two of her own children and then killed herself.

Bike maintenance and accessories   Wheels  Before setting off on a cycling trip, there are a number of things you need to check to keep things safe - starting with your wheels.  If you haven\u0027t been out on the bike recently then the tyres may have deflated. To test them, inflate them , and check them after a few days. If they\u0027ve deflated, you might have a puncture.   A tyre sealant, like Slime Bike Tyre Sealant , \u0026pound9.99, can help to prevent punctures. This liquid is pumped into the tyre to prevent future holes from causing a problem.    If you have a puncture, you\u0027ll need to remove the wheel to repair the puncture using Halfords Puncture Repair Kit , \u0026pound12. If you aren\u0027t sure where to start, Halfords offer a useful video guide to puncture repair .   If you\u0027re planning a big family cycling trip then you\u0027ll also want to make sure you have a compact pump with you when you\u0027re out and about. Check out the Bikehut High Pressure Bike Pump (now \u0026pound15, save \u0026pound4).   Chain      In the unlikely event that you suffer a broken chain, it\u0027s really worth having a repair kit with you, especially if you\u0027re mountain biking. Check out the Park Tool Mini Chain Brute Tool for just \u0026pound9.98, which is ideal if you need to repair a broken chain on the road.   It\u0027s important to use chain oil or lubricant to keep the chain in good working order. The cheapest option is to use cycle oil - costing just \u0026pound4 - but you may choose to opt for a more expensive lubricant like Muc-Off , which is weather resistant.   You should clean your chain before applying lubricant - there are special cleaners to help with this.   Gears          The best way to keep your gears in check is with regular servicing , but if you do encounter a problem, it\u0027s best not to attempt to fix it yourself.  Instead, get an in-store Halfords expert to help you get your gears working again.  If your family does a lot of cycling, then taking out a Halfords Bike Care Plan Plan is a worthwhile investment. These plans are a great way to leave the dirty work to someone else, as well as providing peace of mind that your bike is being looked after by Halfords\u0027 highly trained experts.   Prices start from \u0026pound15 for kids\u0027 bikes and \u0026pound25 for adult bikes and include free fitting on parts and accessories bought from Halfords, as well as a free Silver Bike Service worth \u0026pound50.   Brakes   Every bike needs regular checks on its braking system, as you ride it\u0027s inevitable that cables stretch slightly and brake pads can wear down. It\u0027s another good reason to invest in a regular service at Halfords.  But you can, and should, test them yourself as well to ensure they stop the wheels. Inspect the brake pads regularly to make sure they’re aligned with the rims.   Bolts          The last step for bike maintenance should be to check the bolts, like those on the wheels, are well tightened. There\u0027s no need to over-tighten, as this can cause problems too, but make sure nuts are all firmly secured. A spanner set or special bike tool will be needed, but the Halfords Basic 6 Piece Allen Key Set is just \u0026pound5.99 and should cover most bike nut sizes. Lights       Make sure there are good lights attached to your bikes in case your cycle ride goes on later than planned! Halfords has a Silicone Light Set for just \u0026pound15 that attaches to pretty much any bike in seconds.   If you\u0027re off on a cycling trip, the last thing you\u0027ll want to be doing is carting batteries around, so consider investing in a Rechargeable Bike Light Set, \u0026pound25. They recharge by USB, and feature high, low, and flashing modes.   For little cyclists there are also a brightly-coloured Silicone Bike Light available for \u0026pound4 in blue, green and pink for all tastes.   Cycling clothing      Like any sport, cycling involves wearing the right kit - both to keep you visible to other road users, and to keep you safe in the event of an accident. A welll fitting helmet can seriously reduce the risk of a head injury, so you should get your kids in the habit of wearing one whenever they are out on their bikes.  Halfords stock a range of fun designs like Paw Patrol and Disney Princesses , with prices starting at \u0026pound10, while older kids might like the Purple Swirls Kids Bike Helmet which looks cool and offers excellent protection.    But the best way to encourage your kids to wear a helmet is to lead by example by wearing one yourself. The HardnutZ Stealth Hi Vis MTB Helmet is a good choice at \u0026pound35 (down from \u0026pound55), and is available in four colours. One of its key advantages is that its highly reflective under street lamps and car headlights.    Being seen is crucial for any cyclist, young or old. Grab a family pack of Halfords Hi Vis Vests for just \u0026pound11.99 and the four vests (two adult-sized and two kid-sized) will make everyone much more visible on the roads. Vests are also available individually .

The mother was accused of not taken him out for an ice cream and not getting his hair to be cut in the way that he liked in a 44-page document written by the social worker. But today a judge ruled the mother and son can be reunited. Mr Justice Mostyn said the social worker\u0027s criticisms were utterly insubstantial and obviously inconsequential. The judge said the social worker had outlined her evidence in a 44-page witness statement which was very long on rhetoric but very short indeed on concrete examples of deficient parenting. He said it was very hard to pin down within the swathes of text what exactly was being said against the woman.  Mr Justice Mostyn has made complaints in a ruling after analysing the boy\u0027s case at a family court hearing in Swansea. The judge said the boy could not be identified but said the social worker worked for Carmarthenshire County Council. A lower-ranking judge had ruled that the boy, now eight, should be taken from his mother\u0027s care and move to live with foster parents. The woman had continued to see the boy so her parenting skills could be assessed. She had then asked Mr Justice Mostyn to allow her son to return home. Carmarthenshire social services bosses had opposed her application. But Mr Justice Mostyn has ruled in her favour. He said the boy should return to his mother and his care be supervised by social services staff.

Hilary Sugden had only just celebrated her 18th birthday when she jetted off with friends to Majorca on May 28, 1973, on a \u0026pound40, week’s holiday. They were picked up at the airport by John Bond, a 22-year-old Club 18-30 rep. John and Hilary fell for each other and got married nine months later. Hilary, 64, said: “Club 18-30 gave us, and so many others, the time of our lives. It’ll always be special to us.  “It was the only holiday company at that time that was offering young single people the opportunity to go on holiday and have a good time. We developed many friendships through the Club and it sparked our interest in travel.” They have returned to Majorca more than 10 times since they first met, and have a real soft spot for Club 18-30, which is now at risk of closure. Hilary’s week in the sun in 1973 was her first holiday without her parents.   A few days into the trip, smitten John organised a barbecue on the beach. John, 69, admitted: “I was somewhat besotted with her at that point.” At the end of the week, John asked Hilary to stay and work for the company. Hilary said: “John told me they needed someone to do the accounts, but I think it was just a ploy to keep me on.”  She stayed and they enjoyed a summer together organising activities for groups of Brits. When the season finished, John returned to his native Canada and Hilary to England. But John said: “I proposed to her over the phone.” The couple were married in February 1974 with another Club 18-30 rep as John’s best man and the chief executive of the company as a guest.

A 15-year-old boy is to be the first NHS recognised internet gaming addict .  Primary schools across Britain are warning children are damaging their education by playing the game. Teachers want lessons in online safety included in the curriculum. And so Fortnite has become the latest Pied Piper terror for parents who fear their kids are being tempted into a world they have no knowledge or understanding about. Well either that or it’s just the latest craze that’ll come and go in the way a million others have done before, from Rubik’s Cubes and Tamagotchis through to Loom Bands and Slime.  From what I can make out from my kids’ explanations, it’s a kind of Minecraft meets Call Of Duty – a brightly coloured post apocalyptic cartoon world where survivors battle it out (a bit like Love Island, but with greater emotional depth).   My eight-year-old son has played it at friends’ houses and is desperate for it. I’ve told him that is absolutely fine, and I’d be more than happy for him to buy it with his birthday money. When he’s 12. In four years time. Which is, of course, SO UNFAIR. And I’m the MEANEST mum in the WHOLE world. And EVERYONE in his WHOLE class has it apart from him. Fortunately, I like a row. Several times a day. But I totally understand how other parents have crumbled under the pressure of a nagging child and ended up thinking: “What harm can it do?” According to my friends who have given in already, it’s not so much harm as deep frustration and a lot of rows. It clearly is addictive. And it’s not just kids who need lessons about online gaming - it’s parents too. Because tackling this new threat to family life is tough.

More than 170 guests were treated to a no-expense-spared soldier-themed bash - complete with a four-tiered cake, glamorous decor, and an open bar, at a luxury wedding venue. The soiree saw 60 young children tucking into chicken nuggets, cheeseburgers and chips on silver platters, while adults dined on fresh seafood, salmon bagels, hot pork buns and jellied eels, at a cost of \u0026pound2,500. Little Danny changed outfits three times at a cost of \u0026pound500 and Sharon splashed out \u0026pound2,500 on an open bar for all of the parents.  Dessert tables were laden with cupcakes, cake pops and a giant cake decorated with Royal Guard soldiers, all against a specially decorated red and blue background. And the glam granny spent hundreds more on a Punch \u0026amp Judy show, face painting, and a magician to entertain the 60 children invited. The event even ended with kids taking home posh party bags including a water bottle emblazoned with Danny’s name. The proud grandmother, 53, said she had no regrets about spending such a lavish amount.  She said: “People who know me know that I would do it best. “If you are going to do it, you have to do it properly. “You only live once so why don’t you enjoy it! “Why shouldn’t I celebrate the birthday of my grandson, what an amazing thing that has happened.” She added: “I would do it again. “I’m proud to be British and I wanted the party to reflect that, which is why it has a soldiers theme.” In eight acre grounds, servers handed out bite-size portions of brownies and marshmallows for dessert afterwards.  Decorations included golden balloons spelling out Dannyboy across the wall, two twelve-foot balloon models of Queen’s Guard soldiers and a fourteen-foot red and golden balloon wreath. Tot Danny sat in a bespoke rose gold high chair and changed outfits worth \u0026pound500 three times whilst well-wishers dropped off envelopes and gifts into a personalised Royal Mail postbox. Danny’s mum Georgia Moseley, 26, joked: “My birthday parties were never this big! “I don’t even think my wedding would be this much. “But I didn’t have a baby shower or anything so this is the first time that we’re celebrating. “And we’re making lots of memories for the future.”  The event at posh venue That Amazing Place, in Harlow, Essex, was also attended by former The Only Way is Essex star Cara Kilbey, who shared snaps of the party with her 365k Instagram followers. She gushed: “It’s incredible! What a party. The family wanted to celebrate the milestone birthday after doctors’ previously warned that mum Georgia may never have children. She was left fighting for her life and her pelvis was smashed in eight places when she was a passenger in a car crash in October 2008. Sharon said: “Doctors told us to prepare for the worst.”  She developed pneumonia in hospital and had to undergo a eight hour operation to repair her pelvis, and a five hour operation to save her arm. A gynaecologist warned her that she may never have children and Sharon resigned herself to not having a grandchild. And the family struggled after Georgia was then diagnosed with bipolar disorder after the crash. But in 2016, she fell pregnant and Sharon was overjoyed by the good news. She said: “With everything that has been thrown at Georgia, we cannot believe how she has come out of it.  “So I think, there’s a lot of bad stuff going on, and no one does anything nice when people come through something. “You might get people who say ‘oh what a waste of money’, but why not? “We’ve been through hell and things are going well right now.” Georgia said: “I’m so grateful to my mum, she’s amazing. “I knew it was going to be a big party as we know a lot of people. “This is how we do things, we don’t cut any corners! If we’re going to do it, we will do it. “It was an amazing party.”  Sharon said she was inspired by her dad, Terry Green, a famous interior designer for the Rothschild family, to decorate the party in such a lavish fashion. In a survey of 1,000 British parents with children aged eight or under, it was revealed the average parent will spend \u0026pound433.39 on parties and \u0026pound100.06 on presents for other children – every year. In addition, parents also revealed they will pay as much as \u0026pound223.05 on party bags. According to the research, Brits spend almost \u0026pound5,000 on their children’s birthdays throughout their primary school years, including the cost of buying presents for their own children. Brenda Daniels, of luxury themed parties firm Ne Riba Event Styling, which styled the party, says she has seen increased demand for high-end parties for kids.  She said: “The clients I deal with are looking to have the full works. “There is more of a demand these days. It was popular in the States and Australia but I think it’s only starting to pick up a trend here now. “It’s not quite as much as the rest of the world, I think quite a lot of people are used to going to smaller parties. “You can tell by the shock on people’s faces when they walk into the room, and they see the level of detail we’ve gone for.” At least two clients a month will opt for the platinum package, said Brenda, which starts at \u0026pound2,300.

Beinazir Lasharie, her husband Damon Deiches and their two young children fled their home barefoot as cladding spewed from the burning building. Their four-year-old boy Liban has suffered since the disaster, and last week told his mum that for her birthday he wanted to buy her a hose “for the fire”. After months in a serviced apartment, and having suffered with PTSD and depression – Mrs Lasharie welcomed a 7lbs 4oz bundle of joy 11 weeks ago. And incredibly, Aisha is one of six babies to have been born in recent weeks to neighbours and family-members of Beinazir.  Five of them lived in the same 50-flat block as the 38-year-old in Testerton Walk – one of three sections of an estate that adjoins the foot of the tower. Beinazir says new life has brought hope after so many children were lost, and after a year of unimaginable hurt. Smiling Aisha has no idea what they have all been through. “She’s been a real ray of sunshine for all of us, she’s a beacon of hope,” said Beinazir, who gave birth while living in the serviced apartment, before finding temporary accommodation back in the Grenfell community in March. The mum of-three added: “She wasn’t planned, but God wanted to bless me with another child.”  Beinazir shares a WhatsApp group with the others who have recently given birth and they remain friends, each discussing their own “beacons of hope” who have arrived in recent weeks, in the wake of the most difficult year of their lives. “What’s amazing is, including one of my brothers who spent lots of time at the flat after the fire, six of us have had babies recently. There are only 50 flats in our block,” she told the Mirror. “My other brother, who was living with us, had a baby two weeks after Aisha was born, the other brother had his five weeks after, and my neighbours have just had babies as well. “They were all born around nine months after the fire.

The unnamed mother, who lives in the Kensington area of Liverpool, spoke out about what she says is the city\u0027s unbearable rat infestation. In the video, a large rat can be seen scuttling over her children\u0027s toys while another appears immobile on the right hand side. The mother said her children\u0027s possessions are being destroyed by the rats and claims the problem has become so bad that she can no longer leave her windows open.  She told the Liverpool Echo : Bouncy castles, balls, basically everything is being destroyed by the rats.   I can\u0027t leave my windows open or the back door as they are running along my back wall daily and I can\u0027t put my washing on the line. Like other residents in the city, she believes a lack of proper bins is to blame. She said: We currently do not have bins and are told to put our rubbish bags out on a Sunday evening. My children are upset and crying every day, they can\u0027t go out into the back yard as I am in fear for them.  It\u0027s making my health a problem as well as I suffer from asthma and when I have my dryer on I\u0027m supposed to leave window or door open as it causes me to have an asthma attack. I\u0027ve lived with this now for three years but the past month it\u0027s gone from bad to extremely worse, my children\u0027s stuff is getting ruined. She added: I don\u0027t want to stay in my own home. It\u0027s 2018, why have we not got bins? Why are the bin men only taking a portion of the rubbish and leaving the majority of it behind? We need this street to be a happy place to live, not a place where we don\u0027t even want to walk to the shop. City Councillor James Noakes said he is taking the multiple complaints of pest infestation seriously and is panning a pest control blitz in certain \u0027hot spot\u0027 areas of the city.

As a child, Mark Baker passed by Gwrych Castle in Conwy, North Wales every day on his way to school. He soon witnessed it falling into a perilous state-of-disrepair and set up the The Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust to save the castle at just 11-years-old. Despite joining with the Richard Broyd Charitable Trust with the intent of buying the castle at auction, Mark was still short of the cash needed to complete a sale. The 33-year-old was saved just a day before the auction by last minute funding from the National Heritage Memorial Fund which pledged a final grant of \u0026pound600,000.  The move puts an end to 50 years of uncertainty over the fairytale castle\u0027s future. The three trusts have now bought the castle from Edwards Property Management (EPM) which purchased the ancient castle in 2010 in the hope of creating a hotel development. The Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust will now set out its plans to renovate the castle and its 250 acres of park and woodland.  It is hoped the doors of the main house could eventually be re-opened to visitors as part of a full restoration programme. The castle closed to the public in 1985, though parts have been opened in recent years thanks to work by the trust. Mark described the purchase as a great moment in history for Wales. He added: As a child, I would pass the castle everyday to and from school, and at the age of 11 founded the castle trust.  Now twenty-one years later, we are in a position to purchase and realise that vision. A huge vote of thanks must go to the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the Richard Broyd Charitable Trust for believing in our vision.” Chairman of the NHMF, Sir Peter Luff, added: Gwrych Castle is enchanting, even in its sadly reduced state. The vision of Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust to restore this spectacular building with a rich history and to open it again is inspiring.  All of us at the National Heritage Memorial Fund felt compelled to support their ambition.” Gwrych Castle was built by Lloyd Hesketh Bamford-Hesketh sometime between 1810 and 1822 as a memorial to his mother\u0027s ancestors. It was designed by several prominent architects including CA Busby, George Edmund Street and Thomas Rickman - major figures in the Gothic Revival movement. The frontage stretches for over 1500 feet and features 18 battlemented towers, with expansive views over the parkland towards the Irish Sea.  The main house is believed to have had 120 rooms at one time as well as a spectacular marble staircase designed by arts and crafts architect Detmar Blow in 1914. It was the largest newly built structure of the 19th century and has direct links to the British royal family. Lloyd left the castle to his granddaughter Winifred, Countess of Dundonald in 1894 who in turn left the castle to King George V and his son Edward, the grandfather and uncle of Queen Elizabeth II, in 1924.  It was intended that Gwrych would become the family\u0027s royal residence in Wales, however the gift was refused on the grounds of the economic downturn of the 1920s. The castle was then passed on to the newly disestablished Church in Wales before it was purchased in 1928 by the countess’s estranged husband, Douglas, 12th Earl of Dundonald. During the Second World War, the castle housed 200 Jewish refugee children as part of Operation Kindertransport.

Swathes of the countryside are \u0026shyabsolutely bereft of any kind of \u0026shycreatures, empty like deserts. We’ll all go out to nature reserves for a day trip – treating them like museums and art galleries. We see lots of life there, but on the way home we drive through the wider countryside where there is nothing left. We’re close to an ecological apocalypse and in some places, it’s already happened.  Yesterday, we read how at least o ne in five mammals in Britain could become extinct due to threats such as disease and loss of habitat.  They’re at risk because of diseases introduced by humans or other animals, or losing habitats such as ancient woodlands again because of humans. Many British species are in \u0026shycritical, precipitous decline. We are in danger of losing some of our best-known birds and animals, even facing the extinction of turtle doves and cuckoos.  A couple of weekends ago I was in my garden – I’ve got a wild flower garden and I’m lucky to live in the countryside, but all that day I didn’t see a single butterfly. Nor have I heard a cuckoo around my home in a very long time and I live in the middle of the New Forest, a national park. One day, I just thought to myself, “Hold on, this isn’t right.” These are creatures that are not only of conservation importance, but of cultural importance. Cuckoos are the symbol of spring, turtle doves are in song The Twelve Days of \u0026shyChristmas. What will it be like when kids are singing, “On the second day of Christmas my true love gave to me, two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree,” at school and there aren’t any left? It’s not just about me and my birdie mates getting upset about rare birds – we’re talking about our national heritage. For years, I’ve been reciting the statistics such as a 95% decline in turtle doves and 56% decline in yellowhammers, having conversations about the loss of our natural habitats and the loss of species. I can trot these figures out all day, and people have got used to hearing them – but we seem to have forgotten what they actually mean. They mean our countryside is a green and unpleasant land. Aside from grass and crops, there’s not much living there.  When I was younger I could walk out into a very tiny housing estate in Southampton where I grew up as a boy and find 25 different species of butterfly. That was in the 1970s. Now, I go out into a national park even, age 56, and there is nothing there. This is for a multitude of reasons. Climate change, agricultural intensification, building development, road expansion schemes, housing. They are all playing a role. But we can build roads and houses, we can farm the land, and still have wildlife. We still have the ability to fix it. The most important thing is to realise every one of us can make a difference. We can help by feeding our birds, making gardens a better place for wildlife or by \u0026shygettting involved in campaigns to promote the care of our countryside. Caring alone is not enough any more – we’ve got to take action. That’s why I am going on a “Bioblitz” of the UK to conduct an audit of the countryside’s health. This will help measure the rise and fall in numbers of different species in the future. With a team of experts, people who know their area and know the reserve or site we’re visiting, we will cover five sites a day across Scotland, Northern Ireland, England and Wales over 10 days to see how many types of livings things – plants as well as animals – we can clock up as we travel around. It won’t necessarily be the glamorous ones like butterflies, birds and mammals, but all the little creatures too, the flies, spiders, all the stuff that gets overlooked.  On the way we will be visiting and taking a look at road verges, farmland, parks, allotments and community nature reserves. We are doing this because there is a tragedy taking place in our countryside and it’s time we said, “We want our wildlife back!” If our ecosystems become non-functional, the soil won’t produce food, the trees won’t grow and we’ll all be in trouble. Nature reserves are simply not enough. We should all be saying, “This isn’t good enough.” We want young people to be inspired, to get out into nature and connect with it. The most frustrating thing is we have the ability to repair, restore and reinstate these animals. Wildlife should be everywhere, not only in nature reserves. We need to act now, before it is too late.

The fire was still burning. Just as it was dying down to black, acrid smoke, the wind would reignite it. Sheets of burned-out cladding lay in the road. There was no birdsong. The street was alive with people carrying boxes and dragging trolleys of water and blankets as the volunteer-led relief effort unfolded. Walking twice round the police cordon told me there was no one in charge. No one. Just the shattered silhouettes of firefighters going in again and again or resting briefly on the grass, heads in blackened hands. And something else struck you. This was an extraordinary community. The churches, mosques, community centres, everyday people who’d been volunteering all night.  We knew we were looking at a mass grave. “This is mass-murder,” people said. “We died in there because we don’t count. That cladding was put on to make the poorest place in Kensington look nicer for its rich neighbours.” Everyone was talking about resident Ed Daffern’s prophetic blog, that foretold this. As Ed says: “Everything that happened could have been prevented.”  I met a woman asking for news of her sister who had been on the 21st floor. Later, I saw her screaming and knew she had found her answer. That day, children I didn’t yet know were being brought down alive. One was Naila El Guenuni, now 12, who was on the 18th floor and spent weeks in a coma.

But she was exposed as a thug who battered Elizabeth in 2015 - repeatedly punching her, shouting, swearing and making threats of violence towards her,the Daily Record reports.  Ferrie, of Coatbridge, Scotland appeared at Airdrie Sheriff Court and admitted the attack on her mother. She also admitted assaulting and repeatedly uttering racial remarks and threats to a police officer and breaking into a building with the intent to commit theft in October 2014, acting in a threatening and abusive manner in November 2014, and missing two court dates in July and October 2016.  She had been due to appear in court again for sentencing but left her lawyer to explain her absence after her no-show. Nicky Matteo said: She isn\u0027t here and I haven\u0027t heard from her which is frustrating given that she has turned up and spoken to social workers for the report.

The plucky animal captivated people around the world as updates were posted online and its anxious followers feared it would plunge to its death. There were tense scenes as the raccoon clawed its way up the side of the office tower before perching itself in front of a worker\u0027s window where it showed no signs of fear. The drama sparked pleas for experts to intervene and rescue the critter, which had apparently been trying to raid pigeon nests.  Locals said the raccoon had been without food and water for two days as it was stranded on the UBS tower in downtown St Paul, Minnesota in the US. The animal climbed up and down the pebbled concrete walls as it tried to find a way to safety, with the saga becoming the top trend on Twitter. Worried onlookers gathered on the pavement below to watch the drama, while thousands followed the unfolding situation on Twitter, where workers posted photos and videos of the astonishing scene.  The incident also spawned joke Twitter accounts. One account, calling itself \u0027The MPR Raccoon\u0027, tweeted: I made a big mistake. A local TV station set up a live stream on Periscope, and it had more than 1,000 viewers at 2.30am local time on Wednesday. The raccoon had initially been seen on a ledge on the neighbouring Town Square complex before it started climbing the UBS tower. Minnesota Public Radio reporter Tim Nelson, who tweeted updates for hours, wrote: This poor raccoon apparently got itself stranded on a ledge of the Town Square office building in downtown St. Paul, likely on an errant mission to raid pigeon nests on the skyway over 7th Street. It\u0027s been there for two days now, without food or water.

She would stuff a ball down her jumper as a pretend bump and spend hours playing happy families, unaware of the cruel fact that she had been born without a womb. At the age of 14 she learned the devastating news that, while she had been gifted with all the maternal instincts, she did not have the means to carry a child. Lolita, 37, says: “I so wanted a baby I felt like I was dying with grief.”  But her sister Linda W\u0026aumlsterlund was determined to help, and when they learned that Sweden was at the forefront of research into womb transplants , she agreed to give Lolita her uterus.  Linda, 42, says: “This was the most perfect gift I could have given.” The world’s first womb transplant was carried out in Sweden in 2013, and Lolita had the operation in March that year. It allowed her to carry a longed-for baby of her own – and that child, Cash-Douglas, will be three on June 27.  Today, he is playing Superman, bossily telling his auntie Linda to let him rescue her. He is the world’s fourth womb transplant baby, and his mum was the first to receive a uterus from a sister. Lolita says: “It’s as if I borrowed a T-shirt from her. I know it sounds crazy. I just hope this will become normal for lots of families in lots of countries now. “It has completely transformed my life. A uterus is an organ you can live without, it is not a heart, but I didn’t feel like a woman. This is a hard journey, there was a lot of pain, tears and worries. But it has been life-saving for me.” Linda, who has four children, says she did not hesitate to give her sister the chance of motherhood, especially as her youngest daughter, Angelina, now 10, was also born without a womb. Hopefully, she will never suffer the depression her aunt did, as Linda and Lolita’s younger sister, Lizette, 36, has already offered to donate her uterus.  Linda says: “I can honestly say I feel more like a woman without my uterus than I did with it. Because I have done something for my sister as a sister, and as a mother for my daughter. I have spoken to women online, some in Britain, who are considering this. I urge them to go for it.” Three British women will, in the next few months, become the first in this country to receive wombs transplanted from their mothers or sisters. They could give birth as early as 2020. And by 2022, the procedure could become available on the NHS. Eleven babies have been born worldwide from 42 transplants undertaken, mostly in Sweden, but also in the US and the Middle East. Lolita, 37, was one of the first to receive a transplant. The nurse, from Norrt\u0026aumllje, near Stockholm, was 14 when she discovered she had Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u0026uumlster-Hauser syndrome, a rare condition which meant she had no womb among other symptoms. She sank into depression. She says: “I had always loved babies, played happy families.” Ironically, Linda had never been particularly maternal, yet got pregnant unplanned at 21. She struggled to tell Lolita, but finally did, in a card asking her to be godmother.  Lolita says: “I was angry, it felt unfair.” She said nothing for two or three months. Linda says: “Finally, she said she had two choices – to turn her back, or welcome my son.” Lolita chose the latter path and was there to support Linda, who in turn vowed to help Lolita become a mother if she possibly could. In 1999, they first saw a report on research into womb donation in Sweden. But it was not until 2011 the family read of it again and made contact with the team, led by Professor Mats Br\u0026aumlnnstr\u0026oumlm. Lolita’s partner Patrik was supportive, and from there the sisters faced a series of physical and psychological tests. Lolita and Patrik had IVF, producing 10 embryos. In March 2013, Linda’s uterus was removed, and sewn into Lolita’s body. Linda says: “They said it could be life-risking. This was an experiment, but they were professionals.” Both sisters endured a painful recovery, but the following month Lolita experienced her first-ever period. Linda laughs as she recalls Lolita calling her in fright. Lolita says: “I had always dreamed of it, but I didn’t like it.”  Five embryos failed, but the sixth was successfully implanted. Lolita says: “I was throwing up, I couldn’t sleep, my stomach was so big, but I couldn’t realise it. I was talking and singing to my baby – but it was finally at the baby shower the reality hit.” Cash-Douglas was delivered by C-section at 37 weeks, weighing 7lbs. Lolita says: “I was a mum, I couldn’t believe it.” When Linda met her nephew, she cried with joy. She says: “I would say to other women, don’t be afraid of doing this. It was just the most lovely thing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"young woman applying make up","story":"NewsYoung woman applying make-up in back of taxi stabs her eyeliner pencil into her EYE when car crashesWARNING - GRAPHIC CONTENT Doctors said it was a miracle the woman had not been blinded in the accident in Bangkok, Thailand\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByHeather McNeill14:36, 13 JUN 2018Updated17:58, 13 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA young woman showed why you shouldn\u0027t put make-up on in a moving car when she stabbed an eyeliner pencil into her eye.

The remaining six charges were refunded.Nicola said: “I can’t believe it’s only 13 fines in 11 years.“Given how many cars come down here, you would think there would have been a lot more.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee face competition from motherwell in bid bring simon murray back to dens park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee face competition if they are to make a move to bring striker Simon Murray back to Dens Park.Murray spent the second half of last season on loan at the Dark Blues from parent club Hibs and said he was open to a return – but only if the Edinburgh side went with another striking option.His first choice was to try to prove himself at Easter Road after an up-and- down debut campaign there.Whether he has the chance to do that is up in the air after Motherwell moved to take him to Fir Park.The Steelmen have reportedly had a bid of £50,000 turned down by Hibs for the striker as they look to add to their attack.And that’s unlikely to be the end of any interest in the 26-year-old with ’Well expected to continue their pursuit.A number of European clubs have also been keeping tabs on him since his Dundee United days.The Tangerines, too, have made advances to bring him back to Tannadice.The lure of a return to boyhood heroes Dundee on a permanent basis would be big for Murray, though whether manager Neil McCann is prepared to splash cash on the former-Arbroath man remains to be seen.In 14 games for the Dark Blues last season, Murray managed just the three goals despite some good performances.

He has uncovered ties to Dundee and is appealing to anyone who may have known his mother, whose birth certificate he has not found.He believes his mum, Irene Miller or Millar, was born in Canada but grew up and worked in Dundee.

Neil told us that if he thinks young players are good enough he’ll stick them in and he’s done that.“That’s great for us and a great selling point if we’re trying to convince kids to join us rather than somebody else because you can see the pathway.”The former Livi, Coventry and Hibs man has learned plenty – good and bad – from every coach he’s come across but very much plans to be his own man.“I’ve picked up lots from the managers I’ve worked under – Chris Coleman at Coventry was great and so have Paul Hartley and Neil McCann been at Dundee.“I try to get bits and pieces from all the coaches I see, whether it’s good, bad or indifferent, and mould it all into the way I want to coach.“Being able to text guys like Chris Coleman and pick their brains is fantastic.“I’ve also seen some very, very bad things over my career and want to do the opposite!“I’ve got my own take on how I want to go about it and the way I want the game played.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"former dundee keeper malherbe secured move to greek super league","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee squad member Jeremy Malherbe has headed to Greece after signing for Panionios.The French goalkeeper was brought in to cover first-choice Elliott Parish at the start of January after the departure of Scott Bain.However, despite being at the Dark Blues for six months, Malherbe didn’t manage to make a single appearance as Development goalkeeper Calum Ferrie overtook him in the pecking order.The 27-year-old arrived in Dundee after leaving Dinamo Brest in Belarus and now heads for the Greek Super League.Panionios finished in seventh spot in Greece’s top flight last season, only five points off a Europa League place.Malherbe has signed a two-year deal.Meanwhile, the arrival of former Hearts goalie Jack Hamilton this summer may see Ferrie and fellow young keeper Kyle Gourlay head out on loan in the coming season to gain experience.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1a516c449eb.jpg ","title":"jack hamilton signing a great bit of business says derek soutar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSigning 24-year-old Jack Hamilton is “a great piece of business” according to a man who knows a thing or two about keeping goal for Dundee.Derek ‘Soapy’ Soutar had two spells at Dens Park, totalling eight years, and has seen first-hand how good Hamilton can be.After Soutar suffered an injury in his time at Forfar back in 2012, a young keeper by the name of Hamilton came in on emergency loan to cover at the age of 18.Watching his progress since, Soutar was delighted to see him arrive at Dundee.Soutar said: “I was very surprised Hearts let him go.“He came in on loan at Forfar when he was just 18. He was a great size, very athletic and a really good shot-stopper, great at one-on-ones and his distribution was excellent, too.“With Jon McLaughlin leaving I thought it would be the ideal chance for Craig Levein to put Jack in for pre-season.“He’s moved on, though, and Dundee have a great signing.“I worked with Jack, he’s a great lad and really down to earth personality.“I think it’s a great bit of business by Neil McCann.“He’s a good age with plenty of experience as well at Hearts and all the different levels with Scotland.“It’s a massive signing for Dundee – he could be there for years to come.“He will have to bide his time, though, because Elliott Parish did really well at the end of last season after Scott Bain left.“Every goalie is going to have times when it’s not going for you but Elliott got through that and didn’t do a lot wrong. He’ll take some shifting for Jack.“What it will do is push Parish to be as good as he can because he knows Jack will be breathing down his neck.”After a steady first season at the now renamed Kilmac Stadium, Parish will feel he’s the current No 1 at the club but the arrival of another senior goalie can spur both to excel – and that’s good news for the Dark Blues.Hamilton has represented Scotland at every age level from U/15 to U/21 and was called up to a squad by Gordon Strachan in May 2016.He didn’t get a first senior cap but Soutar reckons he can push his way back into the national set-up by impressing for Dundee.He added: “Not so long ago he was in the Scotland squad.“He maybe lost a bit of confidence last season at Hearts and being on the bench.“He’s very professional and will push himself to the max to make sure he’s ready for pre-season at Dundee.“He’s very level-headed, he’s not one for the big-time if you know what I mean, he’s not a flashy kind of guy.“I know the kind of level Jack can play at, I’ve worked with him and I think he could get himself back in the Scotland set-up while at Dundee.“Whatever fee was paid, he’ll definitely justify it.“Further down the line, he could even get Dundee a fee if he moves on so, for that reason, I think it’s a great piece of business.“Working with (goalkeeping coach) Rab Geddes every week, too, can only bring the best out in Jack.“A three-year deal gives him security and playing for a manager who wants him in Neil McCann will help no end.”The former Dundee and Aberdeen goalie, meanwhile, is still going strong with his Derek Soutar Goalkeeping Academy.“It’s still going really well,” he added. “That’s us had 38 goalies over seven years go on to play pro-youth and we’ve had one recently go out to the US for a scholarship.”Any budding young goalies can find out more on the academy’s Facebook page.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1e51507a3be-564x564.jpg ","title":"james mcpake hopes to plunder us for new dundee fc talent","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are planning to plunder the United States for top young talent to bolster their improving youth set-up.The Dundee Juniors of Central Texas has been a project running since American owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms took control of the club.The set-up in Austin has been steadily growing and Dark Blues coach and former skipper James McPake is out there right now working with the youngsters.Speaking to the Tele, McPake admits he’ll be “outside his comfort zone” as he puts the kids through their paces in the strong Texan sun.He is tasked with heading a training camp over there as well as picking out some players good enough to come across and join his U/18 squad over in Dundee.He said: “Last year I spent some time over here with Tim Keyes and John Nelms just having a look at things.“The club have held camps over here every year, certainly since Tim and John have been at the club.“This time it’s a bit different because it’s an ID camp – I’ll be doing some training sessions and, hopefully, we can pick a couple to come across to Dundee and train with our U/18s.“I went last year just to have a look at what goes on but this time I’ll be coaching.“The facilities are great over there, too, it’s a great place to go to – though I’ll be needing to put on factor 500 with the heat!“We’ll be coaching in about 42 degrees instead of the minus two at Riverside with the wind in your face.”It might seem strange to some to see a whole squad of youngsters all training in Dundee kit in the middle of Texas but McPake is delighted to help “spread the name” of the club as much as possible.“The kids are all kitted out in Dundee gear and they love it,” he added.“Being part of a big club like Dundee is something they really enjoy and the club have done it really well. It’s great for them to have the affiliation but it’s also great for the club to be able to spread the name of Dundee.“You see Celtic and Man U shirts all over so it’s good to see some Dundee ones as well.”McPake accepts this week will be a challenge for him to test his skills as a young coach – particularly his communication skills.“You couldn’t say football, or soccer as they call it, is the biggest sport out here but it is really growing,” he said.“The MLS is getting bigger all the time and the national team has been quite successful, though they’re not at the World Cup this year.“The kids who are starting to choose football as their sport really take it seriously and they are desperate to learn.“I’m really looking forward to it. It is a challenge for me to get the kids to understand what I’m trying to tell them.“It’s the same language – though I struggle to speak English sometimes! – but there’s a lot of different words and sayings.“It will be a wee test for me to get my point across and then see how the players react. I’ll be out of my comfort zone and that’ll be a challenge.“Last year, we went and watched some of the age groups in training and I was really impressed with the standard of players.“As a coach, its great to work with kids like this because they are so keen to learn.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"motorhome owners due 800k as local firm goes bust","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn estimated 60 motorhome owners are owed around £800,000 by a local trader which went bust and is being probed by police.St Andrews Motorhomes was put into liquidation last week after 25 years in business.The sudden closure left those who handed over vehicles to director Christine Galloway fearing they could be left thousands of pounds out of pocket.However, liquidator Claire Middlebrook has offered assurance that she will try to recover substantial sums for everyone involved.Ms Middlebrook said: “I’m acutely aware of the anger felt by every owner at the actions of Christine Galloway’s company.“I strongly advise creditors they should hold off any legal action and allow me as liquidator to recover as much as possible of the value of their motorhomes.“I will very quickly assess the company’s remaining assets and it is then my legal responsibility to refund everyone to the highest possible value.”Clients had handed over motorhomes in brokerage deals, allowing the firm based near Cupar to sell them on their behalf.

yet to take place ahead of any big decisions.Highland Council\u0027 announcement\u0026nbsplast week that it is to buy the notorious 1960s Upper Bridge Street buildings as part of a bigger redevelopment of Inverness Castle has been broadly welcomed.Already there have been suggestions for the site ranging from demolishing the entire block to creating a green space.But any action to redevelop the concrete carbuncles will not happen immediately as possible options have yet to be drawn up ahead of a public consultation, while tenants in some units still have several years left on the leases.They include the Scottish Children\u0027 Reporter Admin-istration (SCRA) which has stated its intentions to remain in its unit until the end of the lease in October 2025 while the Shapla Indian Restaurant is among the businesses yet to be contacted by the council on how the takeover and potential plans might impact on its future.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRestaurant owner Shabaro Ali said this week\u0027 announcement had come as a surprise, although he welcomed the news.\"Obviously, if Highland Council is going to redevelop the site, it is good for the city, it is good for us, it is good for everyone,\" he said.With about another 10 years remaining on the lease, Mr Ali wants the restaurant to remain in its prime riverside location where it has been for the last 22 years.\"I am sure Highland Council will try to keep everyone happy,\" he said.Orkney businesswoman Judith Glue opened her shop in Bridge Street 10 years ago and although she has yet to be directly approached by her new landlord, she was not unduly worried about the change in ownership,\"I hope it will be positive for businesses to be a part of a brand new project which would be good for Inverness,\" she said. \"Until they get in touch and tell us about the plans, there is not a lot I can say.\"The SCRA, meanwhile, occupies the main concrete block nearest the river which many would like to see removed.When contacted by the Inverness Courier last week ahead of the official announcement, a spokeswoman said there were no plans to move out.\"This is where our staff are based and where we hold children\u0027 hearings,\" she said.Following discussions with the council, that position remained unchanged this week.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspScotland\u0027 rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing \u0026ndash also the Inverness and Nairn MSP and co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment \u0026ndash warned the project would take time.\"I don\u0026rsquot wish

That will be the case here and it\u0027 important that there\u0027 a sense of ownership of citizens in the city.\"He said the aim of the group, which had met 14 times over the last three-and-a-half years, was to create an international-class attraction which drew people to Inverness rather than being something people simply saw when in the Highland capital.LDN Architects will look at the Bridge Street site to help create a masterplan by autumn prior to public consultation. A Highland Council spokeswoman said the local authority would become the landlord of any occupants or tenants.\"There will be no changes to the buildings until consultation has taken place, apart from any minor repairs which a landlord would be responsible for,\" she said.Thursday 14 Jun 2018 2:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111987.jpg","title":"British Empire Medal recipient honoured","story":"\u0026nbspAN Inverness man has been honoured to celebrate 50 years of volunteering with the RAF Association.John Maclean (83), who was born in Inverness but now lives in Peterhead and is chairman of the association\u0027 branch in the town, has been giving up his time to help others since the end of his active service in the 1960s.He also served in a number of senior roles in the organisation, and now his efforts have been recognised after he was awarded the British Empire Medal.Mr Maclean said: \"It\u0027 nice to have your hard work recognised.\"I took out life membership when I was leaving the air force in 1966 and soon after I started volunteering with the association.\"It becomes like a big family.

People want it open more often and to accommodate all age groups. It could be based on water fountains/jets, as in an installation in Southend which includes colour changing lighting.Another option is to create a three-storey adjacent lido with open-air pool on the top floor and spa facilities on the first floor.A further option is to take over the nearby council-owned Nairn Leisure Centre pool, give it a glass roof and create a training and competition facility to complement a lido.The lido proposal was inspired by Bath\u0027 dramatic Thermae Spa.Lessees of the neighbouring links tearoom and James\u0026rsquo Caf\u0026eacute have put forward proposals to improve their facilities.Community leaders are excited but have urged sensitive handling of the initiative.Nairn River Community Council chairman Tommy Hogg said: \"That area is part of Nairn\u0027 heritage so they\u0026rsquove got to do it sympathetically or it\u0026rsquoll cause massive problems.\"A council consultation keen to include input from local schools and youth groups is expected to follow in August.Planning officers say \"the time is ripe for a development plan\".Their report suggests building on a trail around Nairn from the Links through Viewfield and along the riverside featuring various attractions for \"people to linger, to learn about Nairn, to take part in an activity and to enjoy their surroundings\".Each point would incorporate a theme and\u0026nbspa dolphin-inspired artwork has been mooted.A draft plan is currently evolving for Nairn\u0027 77-pontoon harbour and waterfront to improve the harbour basin, surrounding buildings and maximise its potential to boost Nairn\u0027 economy.Planned projects include expansion of the pontoon system, increasing capacity to 97 boats and to develop a watersports centre.Other than driving to the links, people generally walk there as there is no public transport to the beach area.The planners say \"there may be an opportunity to operate a land train type tourist train in the summer months, taking people round the links, the harbour, Viewfield and Fishertown.\"Alternatively, there may be potential to develop a miniature railway, of the type used at Whin Park in Inverness.\"Thursday 14 Jun 2018 2:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111982.jpg","title":"Stateside search for market dog answers","story":"\u0026nbspA DETERMINED local historian is hoping a letter to America may finally solve the mystery of a faithful dog that died in a catastrophic fire in Inverness in the late 19th century.Norman Newton has been delving into the poignant tale of the canine superhero that refused to leave the butcher\u0027 shop it was guarding when the inferno destroyed what is now the Victorian Market in June 1889.The story will feature in a trailblazing digital project to be launched by Highland Council at the end of this month, bringing city legends and landmarks to life \u0026ndash but despite extensive research no one has been able to discover the dog\u0027 name.Undeterred, Mr Newton is pinning his last hopes on a Scottish-born woman now living in New York \u0026ndash the great-granddaughter of the butcher who owned the dog.\"She is perhaps the last possibility for more information about the fire and the dog through family stories,\" said Mr Newton, of Blackwell Road, Culloden.\"The rational part of me says it is unlikely.

experience.“I’ve worked with other big actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, but I think what I’m also excited about is that he comes from mostly a theatre background like myself.“He has his own style and he’s also a really nice guy.”One of his recent projects will premiere at the Edinburgh Film Festival on June 22. Calibre is a thriller about two lifelong friends who head up to an isolated Scottish Highlands village for a weekend hunting trip that goes horribly wrong.Ian said: “I am very excited because it was the director and writer, Matt Palmer’s first time doing both.“That’s quite a feat since it is a fantastic screenplay – all shot in Scotland. The scenery is really beautiful and we filmed it in the middle of November so it was absolutely freezing.“The cast is the cream of Scottish talent and throughout the creative process we grew close, like a family.“I think that’s something that will translate really well on screen.”The performer said the film has a worldwide premiere date and he hopes that this will help attract audiences. He added: “I hope it does well since all the actors involved really did it because of the script writing and the subject matter.”Ian was 24 when he fell in love with acting. He went for his first trip to the theatre, a Magic of the Musicals show staged by Limelight Theatre Group at His Majesty’s Theatre.He was so inspired that he walked up to one of the group’s co-founders, John Murray, and told him he would be in his next show.Ian said: “I have no formal training and just went for it.“When I started people would tell me, ‘you know, you’re good at this’.“So I took the plunge and came down to London with very little money and fortunately it all worked out for me.”Ian worked with Limelight and Attic theatre groups in Aberdeen for five years. He then bagged a role in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s revival of Jesus Christ Superstar after performing at the open auditions.Since getting his break, Ian has gone on to work on a films that include Die Another Day, Batman: The Dark Knight, Tommy’s Honour and Les Miserables.More recently he had a role in the ITV series Endeavour, the prequel to the celebrated Inspector Morse.Ian added that one of the films he most enjoyed working on was Sunset Song, based on Lewis Grassic Gibbon’s classic novel of an Aberdeenshire farm girl, in which he played Chae Strachan.It gained a BAFTA Scotland Award for Best Feature Film in 2016.Ian said: “I got to play one of my favourite characters in the film, so it was like coming home.“We filmed in scenic locations like Ballater. It was lovely.”During filming for Die Another Day he spent five weeks in Cadiz and during a fight scene was punched in the face by Pierce Brosnan, who played Bond.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"butcher deserves his chance at broch says assistant boss duthie","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFraserburgh assistant manager James Duthie believes new signing Sean Butcher deserves his chance in the Highland League.The Broch have recruited the striker from Junior side Longside.Butcher has penned a two-year deal at Bellslea after he netted over 40 goals for Longside last season.Duthie, pictured below left, and manager Mark Cowie have been aware of his quality for some time and also saw Butcher in their own side after he played a few trial games towards the end of last season.Duthie said: “We watched him a lot throughout last season and had seen him in the Juniors.“He did well and previously when I was manager of Buchanhaven Hearts I had set teams up against him.“He is a player I’ve been aware of and Mark Cowie has been aware of him as well.“Willie West’s dad Charles is the manager of Longside so he was willing to let him come along for a couple of trial games and we really appreciate that.“He played against Cove and did fine and played in a couple of other games.“He scored over 40 goals in the Juniors and his attitude is great so we thought he was worth a chance.“He knows it will be difficult and there is a lot of hard work in front of him to get into the team because we have a lot of good strikers at the club.“But he’s up for the challenge and deserves his opportunity.”Duthie believes Butcher is a good all-round striker and says it’s now up to the attacker to take his opportunity in the Highland League.Duthie added: “He’s got decent movement, his link-up play is good, he’s not too bad in the area and he’s a good finisher.“He has good attributes and we hope to try to make him a better player.“It’s a good opportunity for Sean and it was a good deal for the club because he was at the end of his contract. “So it’s up to him to take his chance.”Butcher will face plenty of competition in the Broch squad.Scott Barbour has returned from Formartine United and Gary Harris, Paul Campbell, Willie West and Graham Johnston will also want to play up front next term.Duthie believes the competition will be good for Butcher andhe can learn from his fellow attackers.He said: “Scott Barbour is back, there’s Paul Campbell, Graham Johnston, Gary Harris, Willie West.“We’ve got a lot of good strikers with experience that will help him adjust to the Highland League.“He’s a hard working lad desperate for the chance and now he’s got it, it’s down to him and us to make the most of it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 24","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/05/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.We heartily agree with the decision of the Lord Lieutenant to nominate Betty Rhodick to attend the royal wedding.As far as we are aware, no one works harder for Lochgilphead  \u0026#8211 and once Betty puts her mind to something\u0026#8230Betty and Geordie have been the figureheads for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day commemorations since they started, but she deserves this recognition not just for this one annual event, but for all she does on our behalf.Enjoy yourself, Betty and Kelly.The renovated Kilmartin Museum is now almost within reach.This is sure to be of great economic benefit to the region when it opens in two years and it is an exciting prospect that will enable the unique heritage of Mid Argyll to be properly showcased.Just what was last weekend\u0026#8217s Scapa festival at Ardkinglas?The answer is probably unique to every individual who attended.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

She died because there was no match, but I signed up because of her.\u0026#8217Brett received his transplant in October 2015 and, after a long recovery, is now healthy and well.The identity of recipient and donor must be kept confidential for two years, to protect them both, but the pair exchanged cards, giving Brett and David the chance to learn a bit about each other.Then, on Sunday June 3, the long-awaited meeting took place in Campbeltown.Brett continued: \u0026#8216I had butterflies before we met. I was a little bit lost for words but I gave David a hug and shook hands and said thank you. We had a lovely evening together with our families and the kids played together, which was great.\u0026#8216Without David, my kids would have grown up without a father.\u0026#8216The first couple of minutes were a little bit overwhelming because there was so much anticipation,\u0026#8217 said David .\u0026#8216Our kids got along really well and I see us becoming friends rather than anyone feeling like they owe us something,\u0026#8217 he continued.David now works for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) and is involved in its partnership with Anthony Nolan, which has now recruited more than 10,000 potential donors.Amy Bartlett, regional development manager for Scotland said: \u0026#8216The SFRS and Anthony Nolan partnership has already resulted in 28 people donating stem cells but Brett and David are the first pair who have been able to meet, so it’s an exciting moment.\u0026#8216I would encourage anyone who is aged 16-30 and in good health to consider joining the register and visit anthonynolan.org/join.

The astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses. The council ARE pressing ahead with fees at a third Troon car park, at Bellevue in Prestwick and Ayr Blackburn. They argued the \u0026pound2 charge would destroy much-needed trade and lead to chaos in surrounding streets in Troon The U-turn was revealed by Councillor Craig Mackay at Troon Community Council last Tuesday. He managed to finally nail down an answer from his officials, admitting: “This issue has caused confusion within the council.” There will be no charges at the car park at the Walker Hall or the Italian Gardens.  But council officers are pressing ahead with a \u0026pound2 fee at the South Beach car park next to Royal Troon. This lead to anger from Community Councillor Robert Milligan, who said: “I suggest if you are going to charge for South Beach you actually need to provide loos, even temporary between May and September, to meet demand. If people are paying for parking the least we can do is to have toilet facilities without peeing in the dunes. “People are urinating in the sand dunes and residents can see it from their houses.” At the community council police revealed Troon only gets a traffic warden once every 2.8 days. And townspeople feared cars would be abandoned on the streets rather than pay for parking. The Ayrshire Post has led the way on the issue, revealing Troon has NEVER had to pay parking fees. Councillor Mackay said: “ We were working on the basis of parking charges being introduced to three car parks in Troon.  “I had a meeting with senior officers to discuss concerns of residents and businesses, in particular at the Walker Hall. “The knock-on conserquences are complex, particularly with displacement into residential streets.” He finally got an admission the council were axing the charges in a statement from SNP party colleague Ian Cochrane. Councillor Mackay added: “I was still struggling to get full clarity. “Traffic Orders are being progressed at Royal Troon, Belevue Road in Prestwick and Blackburn Road in Ayr. “It came as a surprise to me as the statement said no other parking charges are proposed at this time and that is quite a changes from what we were looking at.” Troon council vice-chairman Dougie Graham added: “We will wait to see what happens.” Five days after being asked for a comment on the U-turn, South Ayrshire Council would only say: “We’re currently finalising plans for the introduction of charges at Blackburn Road, Bellevue Road and Troon seafront car parks – all of which will require a new Traffic Regulation Order (TRO). We’ll soon be getting the TRO process underway, which will include a period of public consultation, and further details on this will be shared in due course.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United.

Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness.

Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England.

Stuart Laing gets a glittering OBE for nearly 50 years hard graft in the shiny world of jewellery. And Kirsty Letton is now an MBE after more than four decades of dedication to Scottish curling. That they live within 500 yards of each other in Troon is highly noteworthy in that NOBODY else who lives in mainland Ayrshire received anything this year. Stuart,68, has been honoured not just for running the family’s firm Laings, but his foundation of a UK consortium that allowed independents to flourish. He said: “I am thrilled and delighted to speak about it . . . this has been very difficult not to mention.  “I am proud and honoured, but also very humbled as well.” In 1970 he joined the family firm which was begun 130 years earlier. He expanded it to seven branches and started the Houlden (his mother’s maiden name) buying and professional services group for independent jewellers. Stuart remains active as executive chairman of Laings, though his son-in-law Joe Walsh is now chief executive. The father-of-three and now grandad-to-five has been such an influence in the jewellery market he’s regarded by the trade throughout the world. He said: “Strengthening and creating a strong, independent retail sector and giving the UK industry a global identity has been extremely rewarding.” “But this honour is for my entire family and colleagues as a lot of people have been with me on this journey.”  Stuart and his wife Lynda have three children - son Simon and daughters Susanna Laing, and Wendy Walsh. Stuart added: “I would like to pay tribute to my wife Lynda, she has been a wonderful support, a real rock. “We have travelled the globe together representing the UK trade.” He also created the ‘Jewellers of Excellence’ brand, which is a hallmark of trust within the industry. Stuart has been involved in all aspects of the industry and was the only UK Director of SIHH (Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie), a renowned association of the best jewellers in the world, in co-operation with high-end watch houses. Curling champion and coach Kirsty Letton reckons her MBE is an accolade for the entire sport. She says: “Of course I am thrilled and proud. It was a big surprise, I must admit.”  And so are the family - husband Jimmy and children Avril, who now lives in Ascot, and Keith who is in Grenada. Superfit Kirsty - now a 77-year-old grandmother of three - is still playing on the rink as well as coaching at Ayr and manages to find the time to grab an oar for some coastal rowing. Last year she picked up a Sportscotland lifetime volunteering award. And although moving to Ayrshire 21 years ago and joining the Troon Portland club the link with her orginal Glasgow four has never been broken. The highlight of Kirsty’s playing career was winning senior silver in the World Championships in Finland in 2008. She is particularly proud of motivating South Ayrshire primary pupils to have fun on the ice, with 269 youngsters participating in her taster sessions last season.  As well as inspiring the stars of tomorrow, Kirsty instigated the strongly contested World Senior Curling Championships in 2000. She also set up the Glynhill Ladies Curling International event, which attracts world-class teams. Kirsty added: “I don’t know where I would be without curling. It has been a huge part of my life for 40 years. “Last week Ayr Curling Club got the active schools gold award for South Ayrshire and it is things like that which keep me going.” Ayrshire’s Lord-Lieutenant Iona McDonald congratulated the pair. She said: “They have made a considerable contribution to our communities and I am sure that this award comes as a great surprise, as many of them do not seek any recognition for the work that they do. •The Edinburgh-based business grandee Sir Brian Gammell Ivory, gets a CBE for his chairmanship role at Dumfries House.

The bill for absent workers comes on the back of 42,736 days lost during the last 12 months. Employees recorded an average of nine days on the sick during 2017/18. Psychological reasons (30 per cent) were cited as the leading cause for absence, followed by musculoskeletal (19 per cent) and hospitalisation (12 per cent). By far the biggest service to feel the strain was the Health and Social Care Partnership, where an average of 16 days per employee was lost. Teachers, who account for 23 per cent of the council’s workforce, were the best performing ‘directorate’ with a loss of just five days per worker.  All figures were recorded between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Council officials said trends were showing a “gradual and consistent improvement”.

owners of The Allotment store, based across from the Bank of Scotland on the High Street, have managed to seal the deal with post bosses to restore a service.\nIt comes after a year and a half without a full-time offering.\nMr Douglas said: \u0026ldquoThis is tremendous news for the town.\n\u0026ldquoI would like to thank Susan Meikle for stepping up to secure a permanent Post Office facility here

reinstate a full-time service in the town.\nIn February 2017, the Border  and Peeblesshire News reported that the concession within the Daymart Newsagents on the town\u0026rsquos High Street had closed.\nThis sparked a six-week consultation by the Post Office on proposals to operate a one-day mobile service in the town.\nThe consultation was met with a huge backlash from local politicians and residents, who set up a petition to restore full Post Office services in Innerleithen and the launch of an appeal for local businesses to come forward to take on a concession within their stores.\nJust weeks after the announcement, local businessman Andrew Caldwell, of Caldwell\u0026rsquos Ices, came up with a plan to open the service within his store.\nBut a row over the opening hours with Post Office bosses soon put a stop to the idea.\nWhile the town has been without a permanent service, a mobile service has operated for several hours each Friday in Innerleithen, forcing residents who urgently need to make postal deliveries to travel east to Walkerburn, or west to Peebles to do so.\nA spokesperson from the Post Office told us that, while plans are yet to be finalised, further details about the reopening, including information about the range of services that will be on offer to customers, will be released in due course.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Work to begin on

which was consecrated in 1242, has previously been painstakingly restored by local resident Robin McMillan.\nAnd the restoration of the graveyard will complete his work to showcase part of the fascinating medieval history of Stow.\nAlistair Riddell of Stow and Fountainhall Community Council told the Border : \u0026ldquoThe repairs to the graveyard have long been a priority for the local

Immediately Jewson Campbeltown chipped in for a couple, leaving 13 up for grabs.CDJFA said a small part of this will help towards the running costs of the festival. The remainder will purchase new equipment.In June 2012, what started out as a return exchange with Lochgilphead resulted in CDJFA\u0026#8217s idea for an annual football festival. Soon teams from Oban, Islay and Tarbert attended, followed by central-belt squads.CDJFA caters for football in South Kintyre for children aged from three to 18.In February 2012, CDJFA joined Campbeltown Pupils AFC, Campbeltown Soccer Centre and educational football to form Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.It had the simple objective to bring all local football organisations under one umbrella for the first time.In August 2012, CDJFA elected a new committee which agreed to bring the soccer centre and school football under the auspices of CDJFA to avoid duplication of effort and to give children and youths as many opportunities to play football as possible.This also involved signing up to the SFA’s quality mark scheme, providing a coaching framework and a player pathway for children which leads to the  amateur football team Campbeltown Pupils AFC.In early 2013, with nearly 200 youngsters attending CDJFA sessions, it registered Campbeltown Pupils Youth FC with the SYFA and more exchanges home and away started.In August 2013, 2001s, U13s were accepted into the Dunbartonshire Football Development League (DFDL) – the first time a youth team in Campbeltown had played in a national league.In late 2013, CDJFA was awarded the SFA’s quality mark standard award in recognition of its efforts.In January 2015, CDJFA progressed to development status of the SFA’s quality mark scheme.In 2017, two 11-a-side teams were entered into the DFDL at 2005s and 2002s.Tomorrow parents and helpers will assemble at 9am on the Meadows to lay out the pitches.Kick-off for the 2006/07/08/09 seven-a-side age groups is 12.30pm with the 2010/11/12s and girls section at 1pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter how dare you laugh","story":"Perhaps you shouldn’t read this. It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.

East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.

Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

Plain clothes police officers joined colleagues in uniform and members of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos community warden team at John Muir Park and Lochend Woods.  John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.  But in recent years there have been complaints regarding underage drinking, with about 200 people at the park\u0026rsquos Bullet Hill in 2016.  Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.  A council spokeswoman confirmed they had and would continue to work closely with police colleagues in \u0026ldquotackling anti-social behaviour in its many forms.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis can involve action being taken against the individuals responsible for the behaviour itself, alongside engagement with parents or s when appropriate.  \u0026ldquoOn the back of operations like the one at Bullet Hill, we also work with colleagues from other council departments to co-ordinate the clean-up of any affected areas so that members of the public can continue to enjoy our open spaces without debris from anti-social behaviour."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/4089089.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=180\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Residents call for change on recycling boxes","story":"              LOCAL residents have urged\u0026nbspEast Lothian Council to ditch recycling boxes for wheelie bins after the local authority produced a video about the\u0026nbsprecycling process.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.

Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.

I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.

Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.

East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.  Current headteacher Seonaid McGillivray is set to be appointed at another as yet unnamed school in the county, with the final details expected to be tied up within a matter of days.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that the decision to establish one new primary school, operating under a single management structure, offers the best solution to not only developing a stronger and more cohesive curriculum, but that local children will benefit from improved progression planning and transition as they progress from infant to upper stage.  \u0026ldquoOur education service will work closely with our current headteacher Mrs McGillivray, and the chairs of both parent councils, to recruit a headteacher for the newly established school.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

Three pupils were invited to return to the racecourse the following day to support an industry roadshow attended by senior executives in the British horseracing industry, racehorse owners and trainers and racecourse managers.  In previous years, racecourse staff have undertaken a number of volunteer activities to support local causes as part of the annual Give and Gain Day, including restoration work at Olivebank Children\u0026rsquos Centre and a beach clean at Fisherrow.

Sarah Montgomery said: \u0026ldquoIn past years we have been very active in supporting Business in the Community\u0026rsquos Give and Gain days but this year we opted to strengthen the relationship we have been building with Musselburgh Grammar School.  \u0026ldquoWith excellent support from Heritage Portfolio, we were able to put on a diverse programme which gave real-life experience to 20 students who have expressed an interest in hospitality and tourism careers, and this will contribute to their employability pathways initiative.  \u0026ldquoThree of those students returned to the racecourse to support us in hosting a British Horseracing Authority roadshow which provided a valuable opportunity for the pupils to put their training into practice and which will be a useful addition to their CVs.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7889540.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tower blocks turn green in solidarity one year on from Grenfell blaze","story":"              Grenfell Tower has been lit up in green to mark a year since the moment the devastating fire took hold, claiming 72 lives.  Thursday marks 12 months since a small kitchen fire in the west London high-rise turned into the most deadly domestic blaze since the Second World War.  Another 12 blocks are expected to turn green in a show of solidarity across the west London skyline, while Downing Street is also to be illuminated.  The tower itself was floodlit green on Wednesday evening, while the other 12 buildings will be lit up from 00.54am on Thursday \u0026ndash the time off the first 999 call reporting the fire \u0026ndash until 5am.  For the following four evenings they will be illuminated from 8pm until midnight.  The display is one of a series of commemorations and vigils taking place this week as the public inquiry takes a step back.  On the eve of the anniversary, members of the grieving north Kensington community gathered for a 24-hour vigil to reflect on those who died in the fire.  During the private vigil at St Clement\u0026rsquos church, the names of the 72 victims will be read out at 1.30am.  From 11am, there will be a service of remembrance at St Helen\u0026rsquos church organised by campaign group Relative Justice Humanity for Grenfell.  Clarrie Mendy, who lost two family members in the fire and organised the anniversary event, said the names of the 72 victims would be read out, while 73 doves will be released outside the church.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a service of healing, community, inclusivity and solidarity, to know we are not alone.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll be releasing 73 white doves. Why 73 instead of 72? One for the unknown. If there were more than 72, we will put one for the unknown.  They will be giving out 400 white roses which people will able to carry on their way to the tower afterwards.  In addition, a moment of silence will be observed at midday by survivors and bereaved gathered close to the tower\u0026rsquos base and nationally.  A community mosaic is to be unveiled, while wreaths will be laid and candles lit.  The tower is now completely covered by white sheeting, with banners featuring the green Grenfell heart and the words \u0026ldquoGrenfell forever in our hearts emblazoned across the four highest floors.  In the afternoon, the community is expected to congregate at the nearby \u0026ldquoWall of Truth ahead of the silent march which will set off around 7pm.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will join survivors, the bereaved and others at the dignified gathering, which has taken place every month since the fire.  Yvette Williams, from campaign group Justice 4 Grenfell, said: \u0026ldquoI think we kind of almost move from \u0026lsquodid it really happen at all?\u0026rsquo to \u0026lsquoit feels like it happened yesterday\u0026rsquo, to looking at the struggles the bereaved families and survivors have had over the year (and realising) that it is actually a year.  \u0026ldquoWe want the nation to keep Grenfell in their consciousness. The anniversary is about love and support \u0026ndash the fight can start again on Friday and Saturday \u0026ndash and keeping that humanity going on that day.  After the silent march, families will come together for a community Iftar to break bread with those fasting over Ramadan.  The following day, schools across the country are expected to take part in \u0026ldquoGreen for Grenfell, a day to \u0026ldquocelebrate the spirit of people coming together.  The bereaved and survivors group Grenfell United hopes the idea will become an annual event which will continue the unity and support demonstrated by the local community after the fire.  This year, children are being asked to wear green to school and help with a community project, sharing their achievements online.  On Thursday and Friday, more than 2,000 schoolchildren across the UK will sing Grenfell From Today \u0026ndash a charity single inspired by Cornwall Hugs Grenfell, an organisation offering holidays to those affected.  The song is also being learned by choirs in New Zealand and America, founder Esme Page said.  It comes as latest figures show that 68 families will spend the anniversary in emergency accommodation, mainly hotels. Some 52 households are in temporary accommodation and 83 families are in permanent homes, Kensington and Chelsea Council said.

While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents.

Bursary support for the poorest young students in higher education will be increased from \u0026pound1,875 to \u0026pound2,000 a year.

Bursary support in further education will also rise to up to \u0026pound4,500 a year, with all eligible students aged 18 and over receiving a guaranteed bursary award.

Remain-supporting Phillip Lee quit as justice minister, saying \"if Brexit is worth doing, then it is certainly worth doing well\" and it is \"irresponsible to proceed as we are\".  He said his main objection to Government policy was over the \"wish to limit Parliament\u0027s role in contributing to the final outcome\" - the so-called meaningful vote amendment.  His shock departure came as David Davis warned potential Tory rebels that they cannot undo the EU referendum, ahead of a tricky 48 hours in which the Government will try to get its Brexit programme back on track.  The Brexit Secretary spoke after some Conservatives signalled that they would support an amendment to the EU (Withdrawal Bill) tabled late on Monday by former attorney general Dominic Grieve giving more power to MPs.  The Commons begins two days of debate and votes on the Bill on Tuesday and Mr Grieve\u0027s amendment calls for a binding motion to be passed by the Commons, setting out how to proceed in the event of a \"no deal\" Brexit.  But Mr Davis told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \"A meaningful vote is not the ability to reverse the decision of the referendum.  \"We will put in front of Parliament the decision for them to vote ... after that there will be a process of primary legislation to put the actual details of it in Parliament, so Parliament will actually decide on the application of the detail.\"  Asked what would happen if they voted against the deal, he said: \"If they throw it out, well, they throw it out. We will have to go away, think about it and come back and make a statement, which is what I am saying to the House this afternoon.\"  The Prime Minister appeared to have defused a potentially explosive row over the EU customs union on Monday night as Tory pro-Europe rebels Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan and Brexiteers Jacob Rees-Mogg and Sir Bill Cash came together to table a separate compromise amendment backing \"a customs arrangement\" with the EU.  Government sources signalled to the Press Association that ministers were set to back the move. However, the compromise is only likely to delay a full-blown showdown on the customs union until trade legislation returns to the Commons in July.  Mrs May set the tone for a tense two days as she warned Tory Remainers that if they defied her and backed Lords amendments to the landmark Brexit legislation it would weaken Britain\u0027s hand at the negotiating table.  Addressing a meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee on Monday, ahead of the key votes, she said: \"I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible.  \"But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.\"  However, Devon Tory Sarah Wollaston signalled on Tuesday morning that she would back Mr Grieve\u0027s amendment.  Dismissing the Government\u0027s compromise, she tweeted: \"Merely issuing a statement in response would make it a meaningless final vote.  \"Grieve\u0027s amendment puts that right and in a way Govt could and should accept it.\"  She said unless there was a \"meaningful vote\" Parliament would be left with \"the grim choice between a poor deal and exit with no deal at all\".  It would also give hard Brexiteers the chance to \"scupper a good deal\", she claimed.  Sir Oliver defended his compromise agreement, saying it was \"sensible\" in delaying a vote on the customs plan until details were more settled.  Asked on Today if the amendment \"just kicked the can down the road\", he replied: \"That is a very sensible thing to do.  \"If you are engaged in trying to sort something which is complicated out, it makes sense to do it when you know what the thing that you are debating looks like.\"  Meanwhile, Ireland\u0027s premier raised the possibility of delaying Brexit to allow more time to negotiate the UK\u0027s exit deal.  Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said extending the March 29 2019 departure date was one of a number of \"different scenarios\" that could be pursued if a withdrawal agreement fails to materialise in the coming months."},{"url":null,"title":"Sir Angus Grossart gives   1m to the revamp of the Burrell Collection","story":"              THE Scottish banker Sir Angus Grossart has given \u0026pound1m to the restoration of one of the nation\u0027s leading museums.

It features five scenes, and measures more than three by four metres when open and over two metres tall, it is made up of five pop-up scenes painted by Byrne: a Highland landscape, a croft, a poppy-strewn war memorial and a Native American tipi.  Made of cardboard, the set was cheap to make and could be transported on the top of a van and quickly set up in village halls as it toured around Scotland.

The adjusted figure for 2016, which takes account of Scotland\u0027s participation in EU emissions trading and is used for reporting against targets, showed a drop of 45.2% from the 1990 baseline, but a 2.5% increase from 2015.

Bosses at LINK insisted they were doing \u0026ldquoeverything they possibly can to keep automated teller machines (ATMs) open in the communities where they are most needed.  But they admitted efforts to protect cash machines in remote areas would only be in place for four years and some could still close within that time.  LINK, the UK\u0026rsquos main cash machine network, is cutting the fee paid to operators from 25p to 20p per withdrawal over four years, but previously unveiled proposals to protect ATMs one kilometre or more from the next free machine.  It has led to worries that more than half of Scotland\u0027s 5,300 free-to-use ATMS could disappear.  However chairman Sir Mark Boleat admitted these measures would only plug the gap for the next few years, with \u0026ldquobigger issues looming if the number of people using ATMs continues to plummet.  He also appeared to predict widespread closures in cities, adding: \u0026ldquoThere are some city centres with 50 pay-to-use ATMs. We don\u0026rsquot think the public will be disadvantaged if that number falls to 40, or even to 30 or to 20.  Sir Mark said cash use had fallen by 30 per cent in the last 10 years, and was projected to drop by another 40 per cent in the coming decade.  And he insisted \u0026ldquofalling demand meant even protected ATMs could close in the next four years, despite a freeze on the fee paid to operators and additional financial incentives for machines in vulnerable areas.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf transactions fall by 40 per cent in the next 10 years, 30 or 40 per cent, there are bigger issues and we need to address those. Our own data shows consistently this year transactions have fallen by five per cent below last year.  In evidence to Holyrood\u0026rsquos economy committee, LINK estimated that up to 11 per cent of the UK\u0026rsquos cash machines may close as a result of the changes to operator fees. But some estimates have put the figure as high as 18 per cent.  Under questioning from MSPs, Sir Mark was unable to provide any breakdown of the impact on Scotland.  But he said 221 ATMs would be protected from fee changes north of the Border.  It came as Professor Russel Griggs, chairman of the new South of Scotland Economic Partnership, told the committee there is no evidence bank branch closures have a long-term effect on communities.  RBS is currently pushing forward with plans to shut at least 52 branches across the country, with a further 10 under review.  Professor Griggs said work he had carried out suggested that while there was initially a \u0026ldquoheavy impact, communities moved on and found other ways of doing things.  He said: \"So I think it probably has a short-term effect but the evidence that I saw as I went around and visited probably 20 or 30 places across the whole of the UK looking at this, is that it settles down again and people go back to doing what they used to do but just in a different way and it\u0027s interesting they don\u0027t tend to move banks.\"  He said that during recent consultation meetings held with hundreds of people across the south of Scotland in connection with the new economic partnership, bank branch closures had been raised only once.  Thomas Docherty, public affairs manager for consumer organisation Which?, said there was a need for more robust evidence on the long-term effects of closures.  He said: \"There hasn\u0027t been a proper study done by anybody of what those longer-term impacts would be on the rate of closures.  \"By the end of this year in Scotland more than 250 branches will have closed in the last four years.  \"I think when you start to get that scale of closures somebody should be stepping up and carrying out that proper investigation.  \"The people who are most likely of course to be affected are older customers and customers who are more vulnerable.  \"Yes, online banking is growing but only 56 per cent of customers, according to UK Finance, currently use online banking, so what is happening to the other 44 per cent \u0026ndash how are their needs being serviced?\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7914297.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Scientists back reintroducing wolves to Scotland","story":"              THEY were the grey shadows of the ancient Caledonian forest, powerful predators who dominated their environment but then disappeared from Scotland centuries ago as their persecutors closed in.  Popular folklore has it that the last wolf was shot by Sir Ewen Cameron in 1680 in Killiecrankie, Perthshire, in 1680 - long after they had been driven from the lowlands by deforestation.  But in recent years a loud debate has erupted over plans to bring back these top carnivores to the Highlands, and let them run free to prey on the deer herds.  Now scientists say that rewilding the wolf could be more than a pipe dream and that a sustainable population is a possibility, but only if it is kept fenced in.  Researchers from the University of Sussex and the University of Kent, concluded that 80 wolves spread over an area of 1,000 square miles - roughly 24,000 acres - would be required to \"reduce\" deer herds which have been blamed for over-grazing and preventing the return of woodland.    The Scottish Government estimates that there are around 375,000 red deer and 350,000 roe deer living in Scotland, and each year an annual cull has to be held to reduce their numbers.  Dr Christopher Sandom, lecturer in biology at the University of Sussex with a particular interest in rewilding, believes that wolves could be the answer to the problem, and that it is possible to ensure they do not cross paths with people using the land.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspShould wolves be reintroduced to Scotland?  The issue of reintroducing wolves to Scotland has proven controversial in the past, with farmers and landowners saying that they would go after sheep and could even pose a danger to hikers.  But the University study found that the idea was viable if an area was created where their paths would seldom cross with people\u0027s  Dr Sandom said: \u0026ldquoReintroducing the wolf has long been suggested as part of the solution to large deer populations but there will always be concerns about how wolves interact with people in any rewilding project like this.  \"This research shows that they could actually have an extremely beneficial impact in terms of making the rewilding process more effective.  The research, which also involved scientists from Aarhus University and the University of Oxford (WildCRU), tackled the question of how many wolves would be needed in an area to bring down the number of red deer to allow ecological restoration.  It used computer models to simulate wolves impact on the landscape, and drew on previous studies of areas were the animals had been re-introduced or were already living.    The team\u0026rsquos analyses found that a fence capable of retaining at least 75 per cent of dispersing wolves within the reserve would be optimum in allowing for rapid population growth that could lead to reduced deer numbers, without the risk of having so many predators that the red deer population would be threatened.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspConservation charity backs bringing back wild carnivores to Scotland\u0027s countryside.  However, it is unlikely any wolves leaving the area would get far if proper procedures were put in place.  In Finland, all wolves leaving an expanding wolf population into a reindeer management area were shot before being able to reproduce, while in the Bia\u0026#322owie\u0026#380a National Park in Poland, surrounding human activity has created a barrier to wolf movement patterns.  Biologists found that the wolf population of Riding Mountain National Park in Canada had limited interbreeding with other wolf populations in nearby protected areas and no successful wolf dispersal from the park had been recorded over several multi-year tracking studies over 40 years.    Dr Sandom said: \u0026ldquoFences are a common but unpopular tool in biodiversity conservation and would ideally be avoided. But where there are conflicting interests, compromise is needed.  \"Fences particularly constrain animal dispersal but as Britain is an island, this is less of a problem. A fenced reserve in Scotland could be a fantastic opportunity to return large predators to Britain, ecologically restore a large part of the Scottish Highlands, and promote tourism.  The researchers suggested that grey wolves, also known as timber wolves, would be the best candidates to be reintroduced in Scotland.\u0026nbsp  A previous experiment in Yellowstone national park in the US found that bringing back wolves to cull deer herds led to forests coming back and more biodiversity. It has since been hailed a major success story.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspLynx should be brought back to roam Scotland  Dr Joseph Bull, lecturer in conservation science at the University of Kent, said: \u0026ldquoWolves are glorious animals, and were originally natives of these shores. The idea of them returning will be thrilling for many people.  \u0026ldquoWhile our model offers insights into what is likely to happen, the crucial next step would be to test these ideas in practice \u0026ndash by creating a reserve, reintroducing wolves, and closely monitoring the system.\u0026nbsp  \"More generally and perhaps counterintuitively, barriers in some form might have a more important role to play in establishing modern wild areas than previously thought\".    Professor David Macdonald, Director of WildCRU and co-author of the study said \u0026ldquoScotland can lead Europe in thinking about how conservation, large fenced reserves and tourism can reframe rural economies.  \"The role of fencing in the conservation of big predators is globally a hot topic.

A new survey found one in four Scottish pupils from a services background attended at least seven schools as a result of parents being posted to different locations across the UK and beyond.  In one extreme case a pupil had been to 27 different schools between starting nursery and leaving secondary.  As a result of the disruption some 70 per cent said they lacked confidence, 71 per cent had experienced anxiety and 60 per cent said they had found studying difficult.  In addition, one in five said they had experienced difficulties with friendships and 44 per cent said they had felt isolated.  The Royal Caledonian Education Trust (RCET), a 200-year-old charity for armed forces children, said pupils from a military background were one third less likely to go to university than their civilian peers.  Moira Leslie, education manager at RCET, said children from such backgrounds should be considered alongside other groups who face disadvantages when they apply to higher education.  Currently, universities give preferential treatment to pupils from the poorest backgrounds to recognise the impact of poverty on attainment.  Mrs Leslie said: \u0026ldquoNot everyone is affected, but as our survey shows there can be significant disruption to the education of pupils from armed forces families, she said.  \u0026ldquoPupils in this situation can find it difficult to study, particularly if a parent or parents are serving in an active situation or because they are absent.  \u0026ldquoIf pupils have moved between schools they can find it difficult to settle in a new environment and there may be differences in the coursework or teaching they experience.  \u0026ldquoWhere they can also find it difficult is when they have an established group of friends that they have to leave behind and start all over again.  Mrs Leslie said RCET was concerned pupils who would potentially thrive at university were being denied the opportunity.  \u0026ldquoBecause of these experiences they should be encouraged and supported to include that in personal statements when they apply to university.  \u0026ldquoThere should also be a way for universities to identify these applications so they can make allowances.  Five years ago a study of Scottish children who had parents serving in Afghanistan found their levels of stress were particularly high in the build up to their deployment with their worst fears being that their father or mother would be injured or killed.  Academics from City University London, who interviewed more than 50 Scottish pupils, also found they felt apprehensive when their parents were away from home and had difficulty sleeping. Children between the ages of eight and 11 were particularly affected.  The issue was discussed at the Scotland\u0026rsquos Fair Access Conference in Perth, organised by the Scottish Funding Council (SFC).  The event focused on the mental health and wellbeing of college and university students.  A key theme was how to improve support for the increasing number of students with caring responsibilities.  Shirley-Anne Somerville, the Higher Education Secretary, said every student should have an equal chance to fulfil their potential.  \u0026ldquoAs well as supporting access to courses, it is essential colleges and universities provide appropriate support for students\u0026rsquo health and wellbeing, she said.  Luke Humberstone, president of student body NUS Scotland, added: \u0026ldquoWe need to see institutions acknowledging and tackling the barriers that prospective students can face.

The protest was also held to publicise a Scottish Parliament petition on the issue which has attracted more than 6,500 signatures.  Eleven local authorities across Scotland have increased their music tuition rates in recent times with some families expected to pay more than \u0026pound500 a year.  East Lothian Council has become the latest to introduce charges with parents now facing annual fees of \u0026pound280. Glasgow does not charge families.

This new Brexit bridge is about as likely to happen as Britain getting friction-free access to the European Single Market.  Two years after the referendum and we\u0026rsquore no nearer finding out what Brexit actually means, though just about everyone agrees it will be a disaster. There is a Commons majority in favour of halting this act of national self-harm by giving Westminster the power to seize the reins from Theresa May. But shell-shocked Tory MPs were persuaded yesterday (after \u0026ldquomeaningful concessions that are largely meaningless) that if they didn\u0026rsquot support the PM, Boris would likely replace her, and probably declare war on France. Well, he\u0026rsquos said he wants to emulate Donald Trump\u0026rsquos style of diplomacy.  Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos crew are at sixes and sevens over whether or not to join EFTA/EEA/Customs Union/Single Market/all of the above. Her Majesty\u0026rsquos Opposition will collapse in a heap today in the remaining Commons votes on the Lords amendments. It is surely a first for Britain to have both Government and Opposition utterly clueless about what to do about a major national crisis. The only people who seem to know what they want are in Brussels \u0026ndash maybe we should just hand Brexit over to them.  In a sense, this is happening by default. After this week, Theresa May will press ahead with her proposal for a customs union in all but name \u0026ndash a proposal which Brussels has already rejected as unacceptable to the EU 27. She will also push her \u0026ldquomax fac solution to the Irish Border issue, which is to pretend that there isn\u0026rsquot a border at all. This has also been rejected by Brussels. Michel Barnier has said all along that there can be no \u0026ldquocherry picking of the European Single Market, and that the UK has already agreed that Northern Ireland will remain in regulatory alignment with it. The Boris bridge is partly about halting what he sees as this dastardly EU plan to break up Britain.  But his own Government is doing a very good job of that already. Yesterday it rammed through the objectionable clauses of the EU Withdrawal Bill which effectively abolish Scottish devolution for the next seven years. In that time, Mrs May will have complete power to override Holyrood over important matters like agriculture, food safety, environment and so on. Not only did she brush aside the SNP\u0026rsquos and Labour amendments, the Government didn\u0026rsquot even bother to honour its own promise to come up with an amendment of its own. Not so much a power grab as a smash-and-grab.  So, you\u0026rsquoll have had your devolution. Anyone who believes that, after seven years, normal devolutionary service will resume needs to think again. The UK Government will clearly not allow the Scottish Parliament to reverse any or all of the changes made in the \u0026ldquotransition period, since these are deemed crucial for the functioning of the new, post-Brexit UK internal market. They are for keeps. Moreover, the precedent will be established that Westminster can now over-ride any and all of Scotland\u0026rsquos devolved responsibilities whenever it considers it necessary \u0026ndash which is pretty much all the time. Home rule is over. If Mrs May was trying to make the case for an independent Scotland, she could hardly have done better.  It\u0026rsquos not quite the end of the matter, because the Supreme Court has to rule on the legitimacy of the Continuity Bill passed by Holyrood earlier this year. This is intended to counter the UK Withdrawal Bill by replicating it: by asserting that the repatriated powers continue to reside at Holyrood. Then there is the Legislative Consent Motion which Holyrood has refused to agree for the EU Withdrawal Bill \u0026ndash the first time this has happened since 1999. But the Government clearly hopes to deal with this in the same brusque manner as the Clause 11/15 issue: just bash it through Parliament on a busy news day and hope no one notices. Well, it\u0026rsquos just the Scots, after all, and they\u0026rsquore always causing trouble about something.  And so Scotland is dragged kicking and screaming out of the European Union as part of a new unitary British state in which devolution in the manner of the 1998 Scotland Act has effectively been abolished. Scots will lose their citizenship rights in the EU and the protections that go along with it as well as \u0026ldquothe most powerful devolved parliament in the world. We\u0026rsquoll be out of the single market, and the customs union while Northern Ireland will remain largely within it.  According to Philip Lee, the Tory minister who resigned yesterday over Brexit, the choice for Britain is between \u0026ldquoa bad deal and a cliff edge. That is no choice. There must be a better way. I\u0026rsquove argued against holding a second EU referendum unless public opinion swings dramatically against Brexit. But I\u0026rsquom not sure we can afford to wait much longer, while this hapless Prime Minister, bereft of any plan, damages the national interest.  The obvious course for the UK is to rejoin EFTA, which we founded in 1960 as a rival to the EEC, and then align with the European Economic Area with Norway. This means leaving the European Union but remaining in the single market. This eminently sensible solution is being rejected by a weak Prime Minister at the mercy of a cabal of right-wing Tory revolutionaries bent on Making Britain Great Again. They must be stopped. The only way is to give voters the chance to consign Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos cliff-edge Brexit to the dumpster of his other bright ideas."},{"url":null,"title":"SNP MSP accused of  unreliable  evidence in defamation race case","story":"              COURT evidence given by an SNP MSP under oath has been labelled \u0026ldquounreliable, self-serving and evasive in the closing submission of a \u0026pound100,000 defamation case.  Uddingston \u0026amp Bellshill MSP Richard Lyle was accused by a QC of giving \u0026ldquowholly unbelievable testimony in a civil\u0026nbspaction brought against his office worker, Sheena McCulloch.  The claims were made on the bruising final day of a proof at the Court of Session by Kenny McBrearty QC, acting on behalf of former North Lanarkshire SNP councillor Julie McAnulty.  In reply, Roddy Dunlop QC, for Ms McCulloch, accused Ms McAnulty of being heedless of racial sensitivities, and accused her and her key witness of lying in court.  Ms McAnulty is suing Ms McCulloch for alleging she used the word \u0026ldquoPakis in Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos car in 2015 and saying she wanted Asian members out the local SNP.  Ms McAnulty denies making the remark.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspFormer SNP councillor denies racism in \u0026pound100,000 court case  Ms McCulloch, who the court heard had a 2006 conviction for theft, has defended the case on the grounds of accuracy, fair comment and qualified privilege.  She initially said the conversation was in late May 2015, but it later emerged she and Ms McAnulty were in her car on 20 June.  Steven Bonnar, a current SNP councillor in North Lanarkshire, testified he was in the car on that date with the two women, and heard no racist remarks being made.  After four days of evidence in April, the case resumed - and concluded - yesterday.  The court previously heard Ms McAnulty and Ms McCulloch were on rival sides of a \u0026ldquotoxic turf war within the local SNP, with two camps vying for dominance.  Ms McAnulty was allied to former Coatbridge MP Phil Boswell, who wanted reform, while Ms McCulloch was allied to Mr Lyle, whose group wanted to maintain their grip on power.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspRacism claim challenged in \u0026pound100,000 SNP defamation case  Ms McCulloch emailed the racism complaint from Mr Lyle\u0026rsquos office on 5 February 2016, and it then leaked to the press.  A Daily Record story three days later led to Ms McAnulty\u0026rsquos suspension by the SNP.  In his submission to Lord Uist, Mr McBrearty said Mr Lyle, who was not present in court, had been a \u0026ldquobit part player.  However he criticised his evidence, including his attempt to \u0026ldquodissociate himself from the feuding, and his claim he knew nothing about the racism complaint for three days, despite his childhood friend and employee sending it from his office.  He said it was \u0026ldquocompletely implausible that Mr Lyle, who previously denied any \u0026ldquoinput to the complaint or giving misleading evidence, had been unaware of it until it appeared in the Record.  Mr McBrearty said the email was part of a targeted campaign against Ms McAnulty that including two other damaging Daily Record stories about her and race in previous weeks.  He said Ms McCulloch could not credibly explain why she emailed 13 people, only three of whom dealt with party discipline, nor explain why she waited until February.  READ MORE: Defender in \u0026pound100,000 SNP defamation case had theft conviction  He called her evidence incredible, untruthful, illogical and absurd.  Mr McBrearty said it would make no sense for Mr Bonnar, who told the court he \u0026ldquoabhors racism, to concoct a story about being in Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos car to help a racist.  Calling his evidence \u0026ldquostraight-forward and compelling, he asked: \u0026ldquoWhy would Mr Bonnar risk everything in giving evidence in support of someone who has made racist statements?  He said it was very difficult to think Mr Bonnar could be mistaken about being in the car, not least because the day in question was the launch of his successful by-election campaign.  However he said some of Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos witnesses, who said Mr Bonnar may have been in a different car, were understandably mistaken in recalling small events from 2015.  Summing up, he invited Lord Uist to find Ms McAnulty did not make the remark attributed to her, and that Ms McCulloch knew the allegation to be untruthful.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspSNP MSP Richard Lyle challenged over credibility of court evidence  He said Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos actions could not be defended on the basis of accuracy, or veritas or as qualified privilege to interested parties because they had been so widely circulated or as fair comment, as she stated as fact that Ms McAnulty had made racist remarks.  He suggested compensatory damages be set at \u0026pound100,000 if Lord Uist accepted Ms McCulloch intended the complaint to leak to the press, or would have expected it to leak, causing Ms McAnulty greater damage and upset, or at around \u0026pound40,000 otherwise.  In his submission, Mr Dunlop attacked Ms McAnulty\u0026rsquos evidence, saying problems with in it cast doubt on her whole case.  He said that at an SNP meeting in 2012 she was \u0026ldquoheedless of racial sensitivities by questioning whether a senior Asian member, Dr Imtiaz Majid, later an SNP councillor, directed the votes of other Asian members.  He said Ms McAnulty was also prepared to \u0026ldquosully the reputation of other witnesses by accusing them of perjury, fabrication and attempting to pervert the course of justice.

He also said Mr Bonnar had been \u0026ldquolying about being in the car, and that there had been no room in it for him as the back seat was full of campaign materials, and that his evidence conflicted with there being child locks on the back door.  He said it was \u0026ldquoremarkable he had waited \u0026ldquomonths after the Daily Record story about the racism complaint to tell SNP HQ that he had been in the vehicle.  He said the evidence demonstrated convincingly that Mr Bonnar had not been in the car, and that was \u0026ldquofatal to Ms McAnulty\u0026rsquos case.  He said Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos evidence had been \u0026ldquocredible and \u0026ldquoreliable, and it made no sense for her to concoct a lie about a talk in a car if Mr Bonnar had been there too and could simply contradict her.  Mr McBrearty said that assumed Ms McCulloch was a \u0026ldquogood liar, not a bad one.  He also rejected Mr Dunlop\u0026rsquos assertion that Ms McAnulty made a racist remark in 2012, merely an ambiguous one, and denied she lied under oath in court.

Scotland\u0026rsquos information watchdog found evidence journalists have been \u0026ldquosignificantly less likely to receive information in previous years, with \u0026ldquounjustifiable, significant delays and disregard for legal timescales.  It comes amid on ongoing row over the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos handling of FoI requests and the involvement of special advisers.  Critics branded the findings \"outrageous\", and accused the SNP of meddling in the FoI process to \"stop bad news happening\".  In a\u0026nbsphumiliating intervention, the Scottish Information Commissioner Daren Fitzhenry called on the Government to end its practice of\u0026nbsptreating journalists, MSPs and political researchers differently \u0026ldquobecause of who or what they are.  His report found: \u0026ldquoJournalists, together with MSPs and political researchers, are expressly made subject to a different process for clearance than other requester groups.  \u0026ldquoThis is inconsistent with the applicant-blind principle of FoI legislation. Their requests are almost invariably subjected to an additional layer of clearance which is likely to delay consideration of the case.  In 2015/16, only 27 per cent of media requests were met with full disclosure, compared with 42 per cent of FoIs submitted by others.  When she took office, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon vowed to lead the most open and accessible government ever.  But Scottish Conservative MSP Adam Tomkins insisted the report \u0026ldquoexposes Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos secret Scotland.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt reveals an SNP government which not only deliberately stands in the way of legally-binding FoI requests made by the media, but goes to great lengths to delay or influence what information is provided.  \u0026ldquoThat is completely contrary to Scotland\u0026rsquos FoI legislation. People will see this report and conclude the SNP government is trying to stop bad news happening, and its woeful performance being publicised, by meddling in this process.  \u0026ldquoThat is outrageous, and all cabinet ministers involved, and indeed the First Minister, have urgent questions to answer.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos parliamentary business manager Rhoda Grant called on Ms Sturgeon to \u0026ldquoaddress the findings of this report and apologise for bending the law to suit her narrow political interests.  Scottish Green MSP Andy Wightman said: \u0026ldquoThis is a damning report, and vindicates the complaints of many journalists and researchers that Scottish ministers are slow and inconsistent in how they release information that the public are entitled to.  Mr Fitzhenry launched his formal investigation at Holyrood\u0027s request after a series of complaints were raised by journalists last year.  He said that by singling journalists and researchers out, SNP ministers were offending the spirit of FoI legislation and potentially damaging trust.  The Scottish Government said it would accept the findings of the report in full, and confirmed\u0026nbspits internal guidance will be updated with immediate effect.  Joe Fitzpatrick, minister for parliamentary business Joe Fitzpatrick, said: \u0026ldquoBeing open and transparent is a priority set out in our current Programme for Government.  \u0026ldquoWe welcomed and cooperated fully with the Scottish Information Commissioner\u0026rsquos review and are happy to accept his recommendations in full to support our continued improvement.  \u0026ldquoAs the report highlights, we have already implemented a number of changes that have resulted in significant improvements to our FoI performance.  \"In the first five months of 2018 we responded to 93 per cent of FoI requests on time, exceeding the 90 per cent target set by the Information Commissioner and a 10% increase on last year.  \u0026ldquoOutside the FoI process, last year the Scottish Government responded to over 5,000 queries from journalists in a matter of hours."},{"url":null,"title":"MSPs demand urgent evidence from Mundell on Brexit","story":"              MSPs have demanded David Mundell appear before them to explain why Westminster has pushed ahead with Brexit legislation in devolved areas without Holyrood\u0026rsquos consent.  The Scottish Parliament\u0026rsquos party constitution committee has asked the Scottish Secretary to give evidence on the resulting \u0026ldquoimplications for the devolution settlement.  In a letter to Mr Mundell, committee convener Bruce Crawford invited him to appear at Holyrood \u0026ldquoas a matter of urgency.  However a Whitehall source said that, although Mr Mundell was willing to appear, it may not before the summer recess, meaning September at the earliest.  It follows Westminster agreeing a controversial \u0026ldquopower grab in the EU Withdrawal Bill, which a majority MSPs refused to endorse in May because it undermined devolution.  The Bill means 24 devolved policy areas being repatriated from Brussels at Brexit will be reserved at Westminster for up to seven years, rather than lying at Holyrood.  The UK Government says the measure is necessary to create UK-wide common frameworks to protect the UK single market through harmonised regulations.  However the Scottish Government has said such frameworks must be agreed by \u0026ldquoconsent, not imposed, something the UK Government has rejected as a veto power.  Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, told BBC Radio Scotland that Mr Mundell \u0026ldquosat back and \u0026ldquodid nothing in the Commons on Tuesday when others were raising the issue.  \u0026ldquoHe should be ashamed of himself.. and ought to resign, he said, adding it was an \u0026ldquoutter disgrace that only 15 minutes was made available to debate the unprecedented situation, and that was hogged by Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.  In response, Mr Mundell said the debate time was \u0026ldquounfortunate, but blamed the Labour Party for pursuing numerous unwinnable votes.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt would have been possible to have had much, much more time to debate the issues in question.  \u0026ldquoDavid Lidington took numerous interventions through his period. What would have been much much better would have been to have longer to have had the debate.  \u0026ldquoThe way of achieving that was for Labour not to pursue everything to a vote.  When it was pointed out the parliamentary timetable was set by the Government, not the opposition, Mr Mundell said: \u0026ldquopeople knew exactly how much time was available.  \u0026ldquoThe Labour Party knew exactly how much time there would be left to debate these issues if they took every single vote, which is what they did, and I think that\u0026rsquos very regrettable.  \u0026ldquoEven if we had had 100 hours of debate the outcome wouldn\u0026rsquot have changed because the SNP and Scottish Government position is exactly the same as it was on day one of this Bill.  Asked to characterise his handling of the matter, including an absence of previously promised amendments, Mr Mundell said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos now quite clear that it was never going to be possible to get agreed amendments because Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish Government have a different view of devolution from everyone else.  Asked if he had considered resigning, Mr Mundell replied: \u0026ldquoI consider that what I have done is stood up for the constitutional settlement that people voted for in 2014.  \u0026ldquoIan Blackford, Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP, don\u0026rsquot like that settlement, don\u0026rsquot support it.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to apologise for standing up for the settlement people voted for.

The Conservatives, he later suggested, had returned to the days of Margaret Thatcher and were acting in an \u0026ldquoanti-Scottish way.  In developments that stunned MPs during Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, the Nationalist leader attacked the Conservative Government, which he said was implementing, through its legislation, a power-grab against Holyrood and had not even given Scottish MPs the chance to debate it during Tuesday\u0026rsquos consideration of the Bill.    Using a rare parliamentary device, he called for a \u0026ldquoprivate sitting of Parliament, which would have removed the public from the chamber\u0026rsquos gallery.  The move appeared to take John Bercow, the Speaker, Theresa May, and others totally by surprise.  As the chamber descended into confusion, Mr Bercow hurriedly consulted the Commons lawyers and suggested a vote on Mr Blackford\u0026rsquos request be taken after PMQs. But the Highland MP insisted he wanted an immediate vote, declaring: \u0026ldquoI beg to move.  At which point as Nationalist MPs cheered, Opposition MPs jeered. The Speaker took more advice, repeating that the vote should take place at the end of PMQs. \u0026ldquoThat is the end of the matter, declared Mr Bercow, calling the PM to respond.  But Mr Blackford continued to stand as the Speaker urged him amid the roar of the chamber to sit down, insisting: \u0026ldquoNo, you\u0026rsquore not moving anything.    As the volume in the chamber rose further on all sides, Labour frontbenchers were engaged in hurried private conversations.  As the Speaker again insisted a vote could take place at the end of PMQs, SNP backbencher David Linden shouted: \u0026ldquoNow!  Mr Bercow responded by telling the Glasgow MP: \u0026ldquoI say to you in the kindest possible spirit, don\u0026rsquot tell me what the procedures of this House are. I\u0026rsquom telling you there can be a vote at the end of this session and not now.  As Mr Blackford rose again to applause from some of his SNP colleagues, the Speaker shouted: \u0026ldquoOrder. Resume your seat Mr Blackford! He then said in light of the party leader\u0026rsquos refusal to resume his seat, he ordered him to leave the chamber immediately.  At first, the Highland MP did not go. As MPs continued to shout, Mr Bercow could he heard saying to colleagues: \u0026ldquoHe won\u0026rsquot, so we\u0026rsquoll have to have the vote.  At one point, Joanna Cherry, the Nationalist MP, could be seen shouting at the Tory benches before Mr Blackford dramatically walked out followed by his SNP colleagues. Ms Cherry as she left waved to the Speaker, saying: \u0026ldquoGoodbye.

He called on her to bring forward emergency legislation so that the \u0026ldquowill of the Scottish Parliament can be heard and, more importantly be respected.    Mrs May stressed how the outcome of the Brexit process would increase Holyrood\u0026rsquos powers in 80 areas, declaring: \u0026ldquoIt is not the case that this is in any way a power-grab. She went on: \u0026ldquoOnly the SNP could say that getting 80 more areas where they are going to take decisions was a power-grab.  Pointing to how there was just 15 minutes on Tuesday night for debate on the Scottish clause to the EU Withdrawal Bill, the PM blamed Labour for using \u0026ldquoprocedural manoeuvres in calling unnecessary votes.  Mr Blackford replied that the reality was powers enshrined under the 1998 Scotland Act were being \u0026ldquograbbed back by Whitehall and Scottish MPs were \u0026ldquonot given the courtesy of even debating it last night it\u0026rsquos a democratic outrage. The people of Scotland will not be disrespected by this Parliament.  Outside the chamber, the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not prepared to stand back and see Westminster engage in a power-grab against the Scottish Parliament and to do so on a basis that Scotland\u0026rsquos parliamentarians have not been given the opportunity to debate what this Parliament is doing. It\u0026rsquos an outrage.  He went on: \u0026ldquoWe are going to make sure we will be robust in using parliamentary devices to make sure we can hold this Government to account. We are in a situation that the Westminster Government has shown utter disrespect to the Scottish Parliament and the people of Scotland by wilfully ignoring that the fact that the Scottish Parliament has refused to give a consent motion.    \u0026ldquoThey are now acting outwith the support of the Scottish people. The Conservatives have returned to where they were before in acting in a manner that is anti-Scottish. We are not having it.  But Scottish Conservative MP Kirstene Hair decried the SNP\u0026rsquos actions.  \"This rehearsed move just demonstrated that the SNP care more about headlines than actually achieving anything for Scotland.  \"They are the masters of manufactured grievance and the people of Scotland are sick of it.  \"The SNP have played games with the constitution, played games with Brexit and now are playing games with Parliament. It is a joke, added the Angus MP.  Meanwhile in the chamber, Mr Bercow at the end of PMqs looked up and praised a baby in the public gallery, who, he said, had been \"a model of impeccable behaviour\" despite the \"turbulence\" of the proceedings."},{"url":null,"title":"animal welfare charity welcomes new addition","story":"\t\tA foal has been born at the Scottish SPCA\u0027s Aberdeen Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre.\t\t\t\tScotland’s animal welfare charity welcomed the healthy colt into the world at 7.30am yesterday (Tuesday, June 12).
