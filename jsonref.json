Meghan Markle revealed her dreams about becoming a princess...Share this articleMarkle Sr said: \u0027I was going to recount the funny story about how she broke the news to me about dating Harry: \u0027Daddy, I\u0027ve met a man… Daddy, he\u0027s English… Daddy, he\u0027s a prince.\u0027\u0027I thought it was a cute story. Like any father I wanted to say a few words. I was going to thank the Royal Family for welcoming my beautiful daughter into their family. But it was a speech that I was never going to be allowed to give. That hurt.\u0027He also launched a defense of his decision to speak to the media and claimed his Mail on Sunday interview would be his last – although he went on to speak to a tabloid newspaper less than 24 hours later.Speaking to The Sun on Sunday night, he added: \u0027I want to say good luck and God bless to my daughter. I don\u0027t expect to see her or hear back from her — and that\u0027s OK.\u0027All I was doing was saying things I wanted to say. I just want to re-establish the relationship with my daughter.\u0027I now want to go on vacation somewhere to try and get some peace.\u0027The latest round of interviews come just seven days after the 74-year-old spent nine hours with the Mail on Sunday, during which he admitted to a drug-taking past, said Princess Diana would have \u0027loathed\u0027 the way he is being treated and hit out at Prince Harry – saying: \u0027I don\u0027t care if Harry never speaks to me again, I\u0027ll survive.\u0027    The source accused Markle Sr of selling salacious interviews to the press, and claims he has spoken to the media more than he has tried to contact Meghan           Meghan\u0027s half-sister Samantha, 53, has also turned on her and has given multiple interviews slamming the former actress over her treatment of their father – despite being estranged from the retiree himselfHis outbursts in the press follow a series of statements made to gossip website TMZ during the period around the royal wedding in May, following the paparazzi photo scandal.Although Markle Sr had been due to attend – and had his name printed in the program – he pulled out last minute after claiming to have suffered a heart attack.Despite telling the Mail on Sunday that he spent the day in a San Diego hospital bed, Markle Sr actually watched the nuptials from a $31-a-night Airbnb in Baja Malibu – a scruffy residential compound close to his home in San Antonio del Mar.He returned home on the Monday after the wedding and was pictured purchasing a creamy drink from Starbucks en route.Since then, the retired Emmy winner has repeatedly spoken out about his daughter and has insisted that he will continue to do so until she contacts him.He has also been pictured out and about in Los Angeles, where he was spotted purchasing a McDonalds meal on his birthday last month. Despite his public protestations to the contrary, Markle Sr has been repeatedly pictured tucking into fast food – including McDonalds Happy Meals and KFC the latter shortly after he revealed he had had a heart attack.Although ex-wife Doria has remained silent about the Markle debacle currently engulfing the royal family, Meghan\u0027s half-siblings have spoken out – with sister Samantha describing the Duchess\u0027s treatment of her father as \u0027inhumane\u0027.She told the Mirror newspaper on Monday: \u0027There would be no just reason for her not to want him in her life, as he was good enough to use to make her everything she is.\u0027Samantha, of Virginia Beach, Virginia, later took to Twitter to lambaste her half-sister, describing her as \u0027heartless, arrogant and inhumane\u0027 in a series of late-night messages.The 53-year-old was echoed by her brother Thomas Markle Jr, 51, of Grants Pass, Oregon, who also slammed the former actress over her treatment of their father – despite being estranged from the retiree himself.He told the Mirror: \u0027It\u0027s heartbreaking to see how this has changed her and the devastation it has caused to my family.\u0027Anyone who saw Meg when she was growing up knew her and my dad were inseparable. Now it looks as though they may never speak again.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/14/06/4F14338B00000578-0-image-m-85_1534224652550.jpg","title":"LuAnn Lesseps reveals relapsed watermelon martinis ros six pack beer","story":"\u0027I\u0027ll drink the whole bottle and then look for more.

Presley told the court that before they married, she and Lockwood discussed having a pre-nup agreement but none was ever signed. Lisa Marie Presley is seen second from right with daughter Riley Keough, and her twin girls who she had with Lockwood (far left) in October 2017Both Presley, 50, and Lockwood, 57, signed the post-nup a year after their January 2006 wedding when Presley was worth almost $63 million and Lockwood\u0027s net worth was zero.Lockwood, wants the document torn up, calling it invalid because, he claims, he was coerced into signing it, he didn\u0027t read it properly, his lawyer at the time - who has since died - didn\u0027t explain the agreement to him, and he doesn\u0027t remember the period when the post-nup was negotiated and signed.But Presley\u0027s attorney, Gary Fishbein, has fought back in court papers filed at LA Superior Court, accusing Lockwood of \u0027feigning amnesia or ignorance\u0027 and saying he \u0027had the full and complete opportunity to negotiate the terms of the agreement, was competently represented by counsel… and entered into the agreement freely and voluntarily, without duress or coercion.\u0027 On Monday, Presley took the witness stand  and accused Lockwood, of secretly running up \u0027possibly millions\u0027 on her credit card.\u0027I uncovered that he had been in control of finances for the 10 years before,\u0027 she told Judge Dianna Gould-Saltman at Los Angeles Superior on the first day of the expected four-day trial. \u0027He had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, possibly millions on my credit card.\u0027 When Presley angrily confronted musician Lockwood in March 2016, three months before she filed for orce, he didn\u0027t deny running up the credit card bills, she said.And she insisted that he sign an agreement consenting to sell all his guitars, recording equipment, computers and other musical equipment to help make up for some of the credit card losses. \u0027It allowed me to pay off some of the Tennessee state taxes I owed,\u0027 she added.          Lisa Marie, daughter of music legend Elvis (pictured in 1970) allegedly asked her husband to sign a post-nup agreement \u0027to protect her assets and her inheritance\u0027Presley hired Lockwood for $3,500 a week as her musical director for her upcoming concert tour, in 2014 and married him two years later. In court Monday, she had trouble recalling the time of that marriage, her fourth.When Lockwood\u0027s attorney, Jeff Sturman asked her the date she got married she replied, \u0027I don\u0027t recall the date.\u0027 And when Sturman asked her, \u0027Do you remember what year?\u0027 she answered, \u0027I believe it was 2007.\u0027 In fact, she married Lockwood in Japan in January 2006. Presley told the court that before they married, she and Lockwood discussed having a pre-nup agreement but none was ever signed. Then, the year after they married, she asked him to sign a post-nup agreement \u0027to protect her assets and her inheritance.\u0027 \u0027He spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, possibly...Aubrey O\u0027Day confided in Omarosa about her 2011 affair with...Share this articleTo support his argument that Lockwood voluntarily agreed to sign the post-nup twice - in July and November 2007 - Presley\u0027s lawyer Gary Fishbein asked her: \u0027Did he (Lockwood) express any objections to signing the pre-nuptial agreement? Did you hold a gun to his head? Did you threaten to leave him if he didn\u0027t sign?\u0027 Presley answered \u0027No\u0027 to all three questions. And when Fishbein asked her, \u0027Did he tell you that he never wanted anything from you,\u0027 she answered, \u0027Yes, he did.\u0027 When Fishbein asked her if the spousal support clause of the pre-nup - in which both she and Lockwood agreed not to seek spousal support from the other if they orced - was important to her, Presley said, \u0027Very.\u0027 Presley admitted that she did pay spousal support to her first husband, Danny Keough, when they orced but she added, with a chuckle, that she didn\u0027t have to pay support to husband number 2, Michael Jackson, or husband number 3, actor Nicholas Cage. Earlier in the day, giving his version of the couple\u0027s fight over the credit card in March 2016, Lockwood told the court that Presley \u0027was extremely upset. We were having an argument about a credit card.\u0027 He added that he agreed to sell all his musical equipment \u0027to appease her.\u0027 Asked by his lawyer, Sturman, why he signed the post-nup in 2007, Lockwood said: \u0027Because my wife wanted me to.\u0027 He said she became angry when he first hesitated to sign after his lawyer told him there were possible issues in the agreement that needed to be sorted out. But he signed anyway, he said. \u0027She\u0027s not a take-no-for-an-answer kind of woman,\u0027 he said of his soon-to-be-ex wife.Asked if he would like the court to find that the pre-nup agreement is invalid, he added, \u0027I believe it\u0027s something the court should decide.\u0027 Lockwood told the court that when he and Presley separated in June 2016, he had nowhere to go so he first stayed in a Holiday Inn, then \u0027couch-surfed\u0027 for about two years, and has been making around $2,000-$2,500 a month working as a store clerk, a factory worker, teaching guitar and playing guitar in session recordings. He said that he\u0027s now living with his girlfriend Stephanie to whom he\u0027s engaged to be married.The revelation prompted Presley\u0027s attorney to ask, \u0027Do you know that when you re-marry you would lose the spousal support from your previous marriage? Does that change your mind about getting married again?\u0027 Lockwood answered, \u0027I don\u0027t know about that.\u0027 Presley - who was in court in a black dress and beige coat and ankle boots - said she doesn\u0027t want to pay up and, countered Lockwood\u0027s attorney, Sturman: \u0027She\u0027s feeling angry and vindictive. She wants him on the street. She\u0027s fine if he has nothing.\u0027Earlier in his opening statement, Presley\u0027s lawyer Fishbein told Judge Gould-Saltman that he found it \u0027incredible and unbelievable\u0027 that Lockwood\u0027s \u0027position is that he didn\u0027t read the post-nuptial agreement - which he signed twice.\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t need to have graduated from MIT to understand that you are waiving spousal support,\u0027 added Fishbein who also questioned Lockwood\u0027s contention that when he signed the post-nup, his attorney - now deceased - didn\u0027t explain it to him.\u0027This attorney had been practicing law since 1956 - he had more than 40 years experience in family law. \u0027Now Lockwood is trying to get out from under a agreement he voluntarily agreed to and signed. He wants a chunk of cash and a bunch of spousal support.\u0027 Lockwood\u0027s attorney, Sturman hit back telling the court that Presley, her lawyers and business manager took an \u0027unfair advantage\u0027 of Lockwood when they persuaded him to sign the post-nup. \u0027They cooked the books - they wanted him to sign something they thought could be enforceable later on.\u0027 Despite the post-nup Sturman told the court, \u0027Spouses have a fiduciary (financial) duty to each other. \u0027Miss Presley is living off her inherited wealth….and Mr Lockwood has little or nothing. He is living at the poverty level. (Presley) is feeling angry and vindictive. She wants him on the street. She\u0027s fine if he has nothing.\u0027 Lockwood - who wore a blue suit and tie and a black shirt in court Monday - told Fishbein under questioning that didn\u0027t remember signing the prenup. \u0027I don\u0027t really understand contracts,\u0027 he said, adding that he didn\u0027t find \u0027contracts and legalese interesting.\u0027 But, he continued: \u0027Had I read it I would not have signed it…I think it\u0027s unfair.\u0027 The trial continues. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/15/17/4F1D7FFF00000578-6063545-image-m-64_1534348820069.jpg","title":"American tourist ties bag thief signpost Dublin","story":"Shame: Photos show the thief restrained with a camping rope as shoppers walk past and laugh on a busy city-centre high street   Embarrassing: The thief (left) swore with his middle finger as he was led away by police after the man who tied him up phoned 999A source told Dublin Live the tourist punched the thief in the scuffle before tying him up and calling the police.He said: \u0027The man approached him and tried to take his bag and phone but I\u0027d say he regrets it now.\u0027  Police said in a statement to MailOnline: \u0027Gardaí in Store Street were called to an incident on Moore Street on Tuesday at 6.30pm.Shop-owner who turned detective by distributing posters of...Defense rests in Paul Manafort fraud trial without calling...Share this article\u0027The injured party had restrained a suspect who on arrival was handed to Gardaí. \u0027A male in his 40s was arrested and conveyed to Store Street Garda Station where he remains in custody.

Here’s all you need to know about it.Munich massacre at 1972 Summer OlympicsThe Munich massacre was an attack during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany in which the Palestinian terrorist organization Black September took eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team hostage and subsequently killed them. A West German police officer was also killed in the attack.The terrorist attack took place from approximately 4:30am local time on September 5, 1972 until about 1:30am am local time on September 6, 1972.The incident started as a hostage crisis in the early morning hours of September 5, 1972 after eight armed members of the Black September terror group infiltrated the Munich Olympic Village and used stolen keys to enter two apartments being used by the Israeli Olympic team.Some team members resisted the intrusion, ultimately leading to the deaths of two of them. Ultimately, the terror group took nine hostages, with a spokesman for them demanding the release of 234 Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israel and Red Army Faction leaders Ulrike Meinhof and Andreas Baader in West Germany. Black September also demanded a plane for their own escape.After debating whether to engage in negotiations with the terrorist group, West German authorities ultimately determined that a rescue attempt would be the only way to solve the crisis. They decided to feign an agreement with Black September, allowing them to transport the bound hostages to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base nearby.          Nine hostages were taken by the Black September terrorist group during the Munich massacreThe West German police decided to secretly ambush the Black September members there with snipers, but the plan suffered from poor communication, improper planning and an inadequate number of sharpshooters to eliminate all of the terrorists efficiently.At the airport, the Black September members became aware of their deception and engaged in a fierce gun battle with West German police. Despite premature media reports that the hostages had all been successfully rescued, all of them were ultimately killed in the failed rescue attempt by gunfire or grenades from Black September members.The Black September members were all killed by around 1:30am local time on September 6. However, the tragedy that resulted from the botched rescue attempt was summed up by ABC reporter Jim McKay who was covering the Summer Olympics and hostage crisis: ‘…When I was a kid, my father used to say Our greatest hopes and our worst fears are seldom realized. Our worst fears have been realized tonight. They\u0027ve now said that there were eleven hostages. Two were killed in their rooms yesterday morning, nine were killed at the airport tonight. They\u0027re all gone.’          Despite erroneous reports that the hostages were freed, all were killed during the massacreWhat was Black September?Black September was a terrorist organization founded in September 1970 as an offshoot of the Palestinian Liberation Organization.A secular nationalist terrorist group, it notoriously launched a number of other terrorist attacks during its existence in addition to the Munich attack, including assassinating Jordanian Prime Minister Wasfi al-Tal in November 1971 and hijacking Sabena Flight 572 in May 1972 during its flight from Vienna to Lod, Israel.The group was ultimately disbanded by the Palestinian Liberation Organization in September 1973.Inception ending explained: Michael Caine reveals what really happened at the endTwitch plans to take on YouTube by broadening its content to expand beyond gamingNational Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday, 15 AugustLuigi\u0027s \u0027death\u0027 in Smash Bros may be hint for single-player campaignEbenezer Cobb Morley honoured by Google Doodle for his 187th birthdayAmazing McDonald\u0027s hack can get you £1.99 Big Mac and fries for lifeWhat happened in the 1972 Munich Olympics Massacre?Could Meghan Markle\u0027s hair reveal when she is pregnant?Aerosmith Las Vegas residency: Dates, tickets and moreWhat is Real Housewives of New York\u0027s Luann de Lesseps\u0027s net worth?Who is Cairo Dwek?

The scholarship aims to encourage the admission of more black students to top universities, after the Financial Times found that some Cambridge colleges didn\u0027t take in any black students from 2012 to 2016. (Pictured: Stormzy, top row, centre, with Cambridge students) The university says that it admitted 58 black students on to undergraduate courses in 2017.Two successful Cambridge applicants this year and two next year will have their fees paid for by the scholarship.Stormzy, real name Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr, revealed he harboured ambitions of studying at either Oxford or Cambridge when he was at school.Despite achieving six A*s, three A\u0027s and three B\u0027s at GCSE, Stormzy didn\u0027t attend university due to his developing passion for music. He said: \u0027Luckily for myself when I was going through school, I had the academic ability.\u0027I was always reminded by my teachers that I was destined, if I wanted, to go down that road and study at one of the top universities.\u0027I erted and ended up doing music so it didn\u0027t happen for me. I thought I was quite a rare case in that I knew that was possible.          The MOBO award winning rapper told BBC Breakfast (pictured) this morning: \u0027If you\u0027re academically brilliant don\u0027t think because you come from a certain community that studying at one of the highest education institutions in the world isn\u0027t possible\u0027\u0027That\u0027s not always the case. When students are young, academically brilliant and getting great grades, they should know that\u0027s an option.\u0027The Ivor Novello Award-winning artist offered words of encouragement to students across the country opening their results, admitting he did not get the grades he was hoping for.Stormzy said: \u0027As someone who used to class myself as an academic, I know how tough it is. I coasted through GCSEs, came to Harris Crystal Palace Sixth Form and started my A-levels.\u0027I remember coming to my results day and looking at my results and they shocked me. I didn\u0027t do too great at A-levels.\u0027That shock to the system showed me that education is a tough thing. When kids are dedicated and they\u0027re smashing it and getting great results, that\u0027s difficult.\u0027Stormzy was joined by his former headteacher Carolyn English and English tutor Claudette Bergin, who also taught singer Adele.          The MOBO award winning rapper posted about the scholarship today on InstagramThey confirmed that the Shut Up star was a hard worker as a student and stayed after school hours had finished to study.The University of Cambridge\u0027s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stephen Toope, said: \u0027Stormzy is an inspiration, not just for his music but for his engagement on social issues and encouragement of young people. He has achieved great success in his career, but recognises that this was at the expense of his studies and the option of a place at a top university.   Stormzy revealed he harboured ambitions of studying at either Oxford or Cambridge when he was at school \u0027He wants to inspire talented young black people who have their sights set on university to follow their dreams. The studentships are a beacon for black students who might otherwise have felt they could not come to Cambridge.\u0027Last year, 58 new black students arrived to take up their courses at Cambridge, the largest number ever but not nearly as many as we would like. We know we need to work harder to ensure that black students not only apply to study at the university, but that they feel at home here and achieve their full potential.\u0027Last year Stormzy donated £9,000 to an Oxford University student so she can go to Harvard.Fiona Asiedu, from south London, started a Crowdfunding page to raise £12,000 to complete her human development and psychology masters degree at the prestigious American institute. Ms Asiedu\u0027s friends posted the appeal to Stormzy\u0027s Twitter account and the music star donated a whopping £9,000 to reach her target.He tried to remain anonymous, but when her friends discovered it was him, he blew his cover online. And earlier this month he announced a publishing deal with Penguin to help young writers become published authors. The rapper will also be releasing an autobiography and creating a paid publishing internship in 2019. Known as #Merky Books, his imprint will publish two to three books a year, starting with Stormzy\u0027s autobiography, Rise Up. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/16/09/1AD5E9A000000514-0-image-m-6_1534407967471.jpg","title":"Brave student opened level results live GMB speaks life university","story":"    Liam Scroggie became an internet icon when he exclaimed \u0027win or lose, we\u0027re on the booze\u0027 after opening his envelope in front of millions of viewers last summerLiam Scroggie became an internet icon when he exclaimed \u0027win or lose, we\u0027re on the booze\u0027 after opening his envelope in front of millions of viewers last summer Reunited with GMB reporter Katy Rickitt, he relived results day from the year before, where he updated viewers on his life as a student.\u0027I had a really good night that night, I got bevvied\u0027, the teen, from Hull, said. \u0027I woke up with the worst hangover ever it was a great night.\u0027I was so concerned about being on the television that there was so much to take in.

The scholarship aims to encourage the admission of more black students to top universities, after the Financial Times found that some Cambridge colleges didn\u0027t take in any black students from 2012 to 2016. (Pictured: Stormzy, top row, centre, with Cambridge students) The university says that it admitted 58 black students on to undergraduate courses in 2017.Two successful Cambridge applicants this year and two next year will have their fees paid for by the scholarship.Stormzy, real name Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr, revealed he harboured ambitions of studying at either Oxford or Cambridge when he was at school.Despite achieving six A*s, three A\u0027s and three B\u0027s at GCSE, Stormzy didn\u0027t attend university due to his developing passion for music. He said: \u0027Luckily for myself when I was going through school, I had the academic ability.\u0027I was always reminded by my teachers that I was destined, if I wanted, to go down that road and study at one of the top universities.\u0027I erted and ended up doing music so it didn\u0027t happen for me. I thought I was quite a rare case in that I knew that was possible.          The MOBO award winning rapper told BBC Breakfast (pictured) this morning: \u0027If you\u0027re academically brilliant don\u0027t think because you come from a certain community that studying at one of the highest education institutions in the world isn\u0027t possible\u0027\u0027That\u0027s not always the case. When students are young, academically brilliant and getting great grades, they should know that\u0027s an option.\u0027The Ivor Novello Award-winning artist offered words of encouragement to students across the country opening their results, admitting he did not get the grades he was hoping for.Stormzy said: \u0027As someone who used to class myself as an academic, I know how tough it is. I coasted through GCSEs, came to Harris Crystal Palace Sixth Form and started my A-levels.\u0027I remember coming to my results day and looking at my results and they shocked me. I didn\u0027t do too great at A-levels.\u0027That shock to the system showed me that education is a tough thing. When kids are dedicated and they\u0027re smashing it and getting great results, that\u0027s difficult.\u0027Stormzy was joined by his former headteacher Carolyn English and English tutor Claudette Bergin, who also taught singer Adele.          The MOBO award winning rapper posted about the scholarship today on InstagramThey confirmed that the Shut Up star was a hard worker as a student and stayed after school hours had finished to study.The University of Cambridge\u0027s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stephen Toope, said: \u0027Stormzy is an inspiration, not just for his music but for his engagement on social issues and encouragement of young people. He has achieved great success in his career, but recognises that this was at the expense of his studies and the option of a place at a top university.   Stormzy revealed he harboured ambitions of studying at either Oxford or Cambridge when he was at school \u0027He wants to inspire talented young black people who have their sights set on university to follow their dreams. The studentships are a beacon for black students who might otherwise have felt they could not come to Cambridge.\u0027Last year, 58 new black students arrived to take up their courses at Cambridge, the largest number ever but not nearly as many as we would like. We know we need to work harder to ensure that black students not only apply to study at the university, but that they feel at home here and achieve their full potential.\u0027Last year Stormzy donated £9,000 to an Oxford University student so she can go to Harvard.Fiona Asiedu, from south London, started a Crowdfunding page to raise £12,000 to complete her human development and psychology masters degree at the prestigious American institute. Ms Asiedu\u0027s friends posted the appeal to Stormzy\u0027s Twitter account and the music star donated a whopping £9,000 to reach her target.He tried to remain anonymous, but when her friends discovered it was him, he blew his cover online. And earlier this month he announced a publishing deal with Penguin to help young writers become published authors. The rapper will also be releasing an autobiography and creating a paid publishing internship in 2019. Known as #Merky Books, his imprint will publish two to three books a year, starting with Stormzy\u0027s autobiography, Rise Up. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/08/08/0564FDED000007D0-5937713-image-a-1_1533714185193.jpg","title":"Swallow flies four baby birds gives morning feed","story":"    These adorable photos show a mother swallow flying over to her four babies to give them their morning feed          Peter Tonkin, 75, from Cornwall, captured the sweet moment the birds wait to be fed with their mouths wide openMr Tonkin, who stood around 20ft from the birds, said: \u0027The swallows had been nesting in a nearby building and the young birds which had fledged were sitting on a bramble patch.\u0027It\u0027s very unusual to see four young swallows having left the nest to sit at the same perch point to be fed, in fact I have never witnessed this before.Stop swanning about!

In the 1990s, I started thinking about how children were engaging with gaming and the internet, which were still embryonic. So when I moved back to Edinburgh from London, I set about exploring how digital learning was being used in schools.The more time I spent in schools, the more I saw what children were actually doing. One of those things was museum visits – and it was clear that digital culture was greatly affecting museums too. So I spent a year trailing school parties taking guided tours around the Royal Museums of Scotland. I would secrete myself in a corner with my lights – this was in the days before cordless equipment – and shoot large groups quickly, then in post-production isolate single children. Here, you can see a split reflection of two girls in the vitrine, but only one of them actually looking.The memories you have of going to a museum are not of your classmates, they are of the objects. I remember the children speaking to the guards, often asking them: “Is it alive or is it dead?” They were five or six years old. The guard would hesitate, saying: “Well, it was alive and now it’s dead.” I can relate to that sense of anxiety. Even now at the zoo, if I’m standing too close to the lion enclosure, I feel nervous. It just appears too open, even though you know the animals cannot get out.The vitrines became a really important part of all the images. This one was an amazing display case in a Victorian gallery, with a glass cupola that gave beautiful overhead light. I remember visiting it myself as a child. On the other side of the bears, there was a Bengal tiger. We would line up to sit down on our little padded seats, inches away from this huge creature. Being in such close proximity to something like that was a strange, memorable experience. And that inidual experience is what I wanted to capture: a child engaging with something much larger than itself.These Victorian displays and dioramas were often quite ferocious and bloody, with animals ripping out each other’s gizzards. That kind of containment of emotion or feeling is a gift for a photographer.The children loved the bears and the birds most. There’s another image of an owl swooping on a taxidermied mouse with a little boy looking out to the camera in front of the case. And another of an impossibly huge albatross in a beautiful sculpted case. The images that worked best were those that played with scale: a very small child engaging with a very large object.I was thinking about children’s engagement with the outside world, especially in the face of the rapidly evolving culture of gaming and the screen. When I was that age, the museum was the place where everything important was held. Now with the internet, that is very different. If a child wants to learn about something, they don’t naturally go to the museum. They go online.This gallery no longer exists. Some of the objects have been brought out, cleaned up and displayed elsewhere, freed from the glass cases.

Reading his books, it\u0026nbspdoes not seem that he loves cities – rather, that he is compelled by them: their dirtiness, their contrasts, their hidden edges.\u0026nbspFeast Days, his second novel, is set in São Paulo and narrated by Emma, an American whose husband has moved there to make his fortune in banking. She is uncertain what to do. She does not need a job but is\u0026nbsprestless, finding herself discontented with meeting wives of her husband’s colleagues for drinks or going to overblown children’s parties. She volunteers at a\u0026nbspchurch that is working to help the large number of\u0026nbsprefugees who have arrived in the country and becomes caught up in the political unrest that is sweeping Brazil.This is an expansive book tangling big ideas on class and race, marriage and politics. Emma narrates her life in fragments, flipping between expensive restaurants and political marches. MacKenzie has found a narrator who can voice many of the uncomfortable issues of our time: one cannot help but read on.He is exploring the privilege of the white American abroad, and Feast Days delivers cutting criticism. At\u0026nbspan exhibition, Emma stands before paintings of “the heads and bare torsos of seven young black and brown men”. She describes them as “beautiful boys … they had gentle faces, gentle eyes” and later tells us: “As a white woman I was conditioned to see any group of dark-skinned men as a threat.” For the most part, this book rings devastatingly true. Occasionally, however, there is a coldness to the language, an emotional distancing that leaves the reader unable to\u0026nbspreally care for the characters.There is also a delight in words that is wonderful to read, a delicious speed to the prose.

In 1965 the ratio of CEO to worker pay was 20-to-one that figure had risen to 58-to-one by in 1989 and peaked in 2000 when CEOs earned 344 times the wage of their average worker.The astronomical gap between the remuneration of workers and bosses has been brought into sharper focus by a new financial disclosure rule that forces companies to publish the ratio of CEO to worker pay. Last year McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook earned $21.7m while the McDonald’s workers earned a median wage of just $7,017 – a CEO to worker pay ratio of 3,101-to-one. The average Walmart worker earned $19,177 in 2017 while CEO Doug McMillon took home $22.8m – a ratio of 1,188-to-one. But the average is skewed by outliers, particularly the tech companies, where the CEO founders may own large chunks of the company but not take home much in compensation, relatively speaking. Amazon’s boss, Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest man, took home $1.7m in 2017 while the average Amazon worker earned $28,446 - a ratio of 59-to-one. Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg’s compensation was $8.8m in 2017 while his well paid workforce earned an average of $240,430 – a ratio of 37-to-one. But neither man is waiting on his monthly paycheck. Bezos’s personal fortune now tops $154bn while Zuckerberg’s is close to $66bn, according to Forbes.The compensation bonanza was driven by stock-related components of CEO compensation such as stock awards or the opportunity to cash in stock options, said Lawrence Mishel, a distinguished fellow at the Economic Policy Institute.“Over time I think there has been a loosening of norms.” said Mischel. “Everyone wants to believe their CEO is one of the best, so they look around and see what everyone else is being paid and then they pay them a lot more. They think everyone is better than average.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19937c54ecfcddc23d27f8d566ee8ffb67fea75a/13_43_2435_1461/master/2435.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09cc21cc554b11484db623176362d67d","title":"royal mail changes course on outdated redirects","story":"Cost of mail redirects to change to ‘per household’ basis and made cheaper after Citizens Advice campaignRoyal Mail has bowed to pressure over how it charges for its redirection service, which critics say penalises modern families with different surnames.Citizens Advice has urged Royal Mail to change the cost of mail redirections from a “per surname” to a “per household” basis.Charging per surname to redirect mail penalises unmarried couples and spouses who keep their own names, as well as children and elderly relatives with different surnames who live in the same household, the charity said.

With inflation-busting utility bill increases and mortgage interest starting to rise, households are likely to find they have less money to spend on the high street in the second half of the year.

Food sales remained robust as people continued to enjoy the World Cup and the sunshine.”Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, was cautiously optimistic, saying that while consumers were under pressure from weak wage growth, the figures showed retail sales started the third quarter of the year in robust health.“Of course, retail sales only account for about a third of total household spending, so the strength of spending on the high street could be offset by households reducing their outlay elsewhere,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f11e3879c80ab42bd2ad793014c2bb85e91308d4/16_103_1296_777/master/1296.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=076a47789c026ce9a5f63f8b04220c9f","title":"could greening every paris schoolyard cool the city","story":"Playground oases could benefit students and city alike, but will making them public prove too controversial in a city on high alert?It’s only 10am but the heat is already radiating off the asphalt at the École Riblette, a primary school on the outskirts of Paris. Sébastien Maire, the city’s chief resilience officer, points to the school’s lower courtyard, a classic heat trap: surrounded by concrete walls that reflect sunlight inside. Last June, the courtyard hit 55C (131F).“For three days, school activities stopped,” Maire says. “It was not possible for the children to study, nor to go into the schoolyard. We would forbid them because it’s 55 degrees – you can fry an egg on the ground.”The École Riblette is now a guinea pig for Project Oasis, a plan to convert the concrete schoolyards of Paris into “islands of cool”. The goal is to provide respite in periods of extreme heat, and perhaps even bring down temperatures across a city with a desperate shortage of green space.Maire explains how the courtyards at this school will be transformed: a green wall here, a vegetable planter there, expanded areas of shade. There will be new trees and special surfaces that can absorb water when it rains. If all goes to plan, all of Paris’s 800 schools will be transformed into green spaces by 2040. The City of Paris plan is also being facilitated by 100 Resilient Cities (100RC), a project of the Rockefeller Foundation, which also supports  Cities. But if the trees and planters are uncontroversial, the next two steps of the scheme could prove more difficult for the city to sell. Maire first wants to open up these newly built green spaces to vulnerable people during heatwaves, and eventually wants the general public to enjoy them too – albeit outside school hours.“By 2050, we’ll have 800 cool spots in the city using school infrastructure,” he says, arguing that it is a better alternative than taking vulnerable people to supermarkets and churches. Lina Liakou, the regional director for Europe at 100RC, says of the new green spaces: “They don’t just address the environmental challenges, but also improve social cohesion and create a better environment for the people around them.”That holistic approach stemmed from an 18-month resilience-building process that the city underwent in collaboration with 100RC, attempting to think in a more interconnected way – not just focusing on climate after the Paris Agreement, but also “the social and inclusion issues that have so clearly impacted the city”, says Andrew Brenner, associate director of global communications at 100RC. “The fact that the city is looking at the oases as not climate interventions – tackling a singular challenge, in this case heat – but rather resilience interventions with multiple benefits, and elaborating that from the start, is a huge development.” Still, opening up Paris’s fortress-like schools to everyone is not an easy pitch in a city that remains on high alert. Terror attacks have killed 150 people since 2015. Heightened security measures make it difficult even for parents to access schools. Liakou says this part of the project has not yet been finalised. “It’s a challenge for the city of Paris, and we want to work with them and pressure them more,” she says.Maire is undeterred. He says the spaces will be kept safe and clean, and says no one will force a school to open its doors to the public if parents and teachers don’t agree to it.He points out that heatwaves have killed many more people in France than terrorism has: 580 people died in a single week of heat last year, and the European heatwave of 2003 killed 14,800. Maire also argues that bringing people together in school grounds is an essential part of making Paris more resilient to terrorism – setting himself in stark opposition to the French state.“They have been forbidding people to organise small things together because of terrorism: ‘You shouldn’t convene, you shouldn’t meet together, you’re going to be targets, so stay at home,’” Maire says. “But the resilient vision says, ‘If a crazy guy wants to commit something, we won’t be able to prevent it. Stop lying to the people.’”“Our concern is much more how society can face this and bounce back afterwards. What is the way? To know your neighbour, to do things with people. Not to be alone in front of your TV scared by terrorism, but to convene.” As for whether increasing green cover in schools can actually bring down temperatures across Paris, it’s still unclear. There is some evidence that making Paris greener can cool the city. In 2012, researchers from the French weather service simulated the 2003 heatwave against a number of adaptation scenarios. They found that turning every bit of bare land in the city of Paris into green space, including half of all pavements wider than 15 metres, could bring heatwave temperatures down by three to five degrees during the day.But that’s only if more than a thousand hectares of land turn green in the next few decades. Together, Paris’s schoolyards comprise just 80 hectares, and they won’t go completely green: École Riblette is keeping one of its yards asphalted so students can play sport.“Vegetation in schools is one step towards putting more vegetation in the city, which could have an overall microclimate effect and cool the entire city,” says Vincent Viguié, a research scientist at the International Research Centre on the Environment and Development. But he warns that even the best-case scenario isn’t good enough to take on Paris’s rapidly warming climate. “It’s nice, but it’s not sufficient.”Virué also points out that drainable concrete surfaces like the one proposed for École Riblette are less effective than grass lawns, which would reflect heat outwards instead of absorbing it. “When there is a heatwave, it doesn’t rain,” he says. “So to have porous bitumen doesn’t have such a big effect to cool the air.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f513dffbffc4a07a047dbfd196ba8cf4b71cae44/0_0_4392_2635/master/4392.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c190581ba713e700aebb8a432b5e274c","title":"a level results show some solidarity with students","story":"We put our kids under relentless pressure yet still claim their grades are being devalued.

Or maybe you have an 18-year-old of your own, in which case you will have woken, ashen, from a night plagued by terrors, a clan of hyenas – internationally recognised metaphor for the forces of marketisation – attacking your baby, while you are powerless to help because you’re trying on shoes.It was a useful frame politically: by 2010 it fed into the overall austerity bilge that everything had simply got worse “because liberals” it portrayed teachers as self-interested, working against the long-term interests of students, thus undermining their legitimacy when they said things like: “We can’t teach this new syllabus because we can’t afford the new textbooks” and it had a fix – make exams harder – which looked easy, so long as you didn’t give any thought to what that might entail. Underlying it was this (unintoxicating) cocktail of observable counterpoints: kids did seem to be working harder. They seemed to be under considerably more pressure and to take everything a lot more seriously. They seemed to reach university with a significant anxiety burden. It was all so complicated who could say what caused what? They might simply be anxious about debt, or body image. There was no satisfying clunk of a reality totally at odds with an accepted truth instead, a lot of fine distinctions and blurred causalities.But what a cruel thing we have done to 18-year-olds, caught in this vice of politics’s making, under unendurable pressure to be the best at everything, then called flakes and lightweights when they get three As because so has everyone else.

Would an 18-year-old take any solace from that? Probably not. They’d probably mutter: “It wasn’t the same for you, old-timer, you were allowed to get a C without being permanently ejected from the society of the right-thinking.” But it would remind us all to stop being such jerks, and that would help.Feminism is ided into waves, first to fourth. It would be more useful to ide feminists by attitude, since doing it chronologically carries the unfortunate connotation that everyone the same age thinks the same thing. Here, Madonna – encompassing every strand of feminism with her sheer refusal to lock into one position – can be our guide.First wavers took their fight to the world arguably, they were just prioritising. There would have been very little point establishing whether men were more or less useful than a bicycle was to a fish before you had a chance to vote on it. You’d think their Madonna era would be late stage – Rebel Heart, the point at which love and revolution meet – but in fact it’s True Blue: they were, above all, practical and literal. You couldn’t smash things up without smashing things up. And you don’t make a pop sensation without making pop.Second wavers were “screw you, I don’t have to be the woman you want a woman to be”, which is not – as you might think – the pointy-bra era (that was ludic and sexual, see “fourth wave”, below) but the Ray of Light phase (“You think it’s time I shuffled off? Not gonna”). The third wave was slightly indolent, can’t-we-all-agree? feminism, and this is American Life Madonna, one minute dressed as Che Guevara, the next snogging Britney a sloping, devilish, “aren’t women and men the same, really?

What once was a last chance saloon for students who didn’t get the grades is increasingly about offering students the chance to reassess. Have they chosen the right course at the right place to spend three to four years of their life? It can’t hurt to shop around for a better fit. Clearing officially starts on A-level results day, 16 August, although many universities will have already been advertising their vacancies and registering student applications from July. Thousands of universities will be looking to fill vacancies on courses that haven’t yet been filled, and will hand out offers with a fixed acceptance window – normally a day or two – to the first students they hear from who meet their requirements. Naturally, the most popular courses and the most prestigious universities tend to run out of places first – some as soon as the phone lines open on the day itself.Clearing is part of the\u0026nbspUcas\u0026nbspadmissions process matching students with unfilled places at universities and colleges.But there are plenty of options available this year, so even students holding a firm offer and feeling confident about their grades may be looking around. “When it came to initially choosing my firm and insurance offers on Ucas, I rushed,” says Katherine McLaughlin, who went through clearing last year despite hitting her grades. “I was swayed by other people’s opinions and the fact the university offered reduced grade boundaries if you chose it as your firm. Almost instantly, I knew I had made a mistake.”McLaughlin is now headed into her second year of criminology and social policy at Loughborough University. She needed the extra time between accepting her Ucas offers and clearing to realise that she didn’t want to study in a big city, and would rather be in a student town near big cities and Loughborough fitted the bill.But while clearing definitely offers a second chance, it’s important to start the day prepared – especially if you have an idea what you want. Emma Leech, director of marketing and advancement at Loughborough, points out that students accepted through clearing have higher dropout rates, possibly because they’ve rushed into making a choice or been influenced by non-essential factors. She adds that the clearing process will be better supported than ever this year. “We’re going to see phone lines opening earlier and earlier, more staff in call centres, lots more focus on other methods of getting in touch, and a big push in advance of clearing.”Bear in mind that clearing in 2018 won’t just be about students competing for places universities will also be competing for students. Leech warns there may be some “unethical practices” as a result, with offers of laptops, tablets and bus travel passes dangled in front of students. “Don’t go for shortcuts and things that glitter it’s student experience, outcomes, academic quality and provision that matter,” she adds.Olivia Capocci knew her A-levels hadn’t gone well enough to secure her law place, but one 10-minute call turned her fortunes around. Interview by Lucy Tobin“Results day at school felt like a surreal scene in a Hollywood film,” says 19-year-old Olivia Capocci. “Everyone who’d done well was outside jumping up and down, taking selfies and celebrating – and anyone who was disappointed, like me, was inside with parents and teachers. There were a few shocked faces, but most of us were trying hard to work out exactly what to do next.”Capocci, who’s from Gosforth in Newcastle upon Tyne, opened her A-level results envelope in the car outside school. “I got really stressed during exams and knew I hadn’t got the three As I needed for my offer to study law at the University of York. I didn’t want to find that out in front of everyone.” She had Bs in English literature and biology, and a C in chemistry, which meant she’d also missed out on her ABB insurance offer at the University of Liverpool.“I was a bit panicked because I’d worked my socks off – and when I phoned York, they immediately said no. The Liverpool phoneline was engaged, so I went into school to start tackling clearing.”Some groundwork ahead of results day helped. “Since I’d known my exams did not go to plan, I’d come up with a list of possible clearing options based on the ’s university league tables. Having that list helped calm my nerves.”She quickly scooped an offer to read law at Northumbria, but didn’t like the idea of staying in Newcastle for university. Then she finally got through to Liverpool’s clearing hotline. “They were fantastic on the phone, really calm and friendly, which was such a relief. The call only lasted 10 minutes, but at the end I was offered a place to study English literature.”It was a subject Capocci had been thinking of studying instead of law at the beginning of sixth form. “So I was over the moon – especially as the course allowed me to study law as a subsidiary in my first year, meaning I could still get a taste for the subject I’d originally picked to study.”Not everything was organised so quickly. “It took several stressful days to sort accommodation, but eventually I managed to get into one of the popular first-year halls,” Capocci adds. “Now I’ve settled in really well. I love the city, I’m really enjoying the course and I’m rowing too, training six days a week and travelling around the country for competitions.”To others facing clearing this year, Olivia advises: “Be flexible about your choice of subject - and city - and have back-up ideas if the grades don’t all go to plan.“Slipping a grade or two is not the end of the world – even if that’s how it feels when you’re staring at A-level results that you didn’t want to see.

My parents were comforting and supportive, though, and I knew that even if I hadn’t done well, I still had the academic ability to do a degree. I was still set on studying to become a psychologist, and I’d put a lot of pressure on myself to go on to higher education.I started ringing up other universities. I’d signed up for an email service from Ucas, which is how I heard Bedfordshire had places in psychology. It all happened quickly – I rang and spoke to an academic coordinator who was really welcoming. They asked me my English and maths GCSE grades – which were good – and then they made me an offer. I really liked the sound of the teaching style, and the course has exceeded my expectations. I’m planning to do a doctorate in educational psychology in 2019 – so I’ve still got a bit more studying to go.Failing to get my grades is the most valuable experience I’ve ever had.

He is funding two places this year and two next year.The move comes amid concerns about lack of ersity at the Oxbridge universities. Figures published in June showed some Cambridge colleges admitted no black students or accepted as few as one a year between 2012 and 2016.Stormzy said that when he was at school he had ambitions to study at Oxbridge but some people did not realise the option was open to them.“I was always reminded by my teachers that I was destined, if I wanted, to go down that road and study at one of the top universities,” he said. “I erted and ended up doing music so it didn’t happen for me. I thought I was quite a rare case in that I knew that was possible.“That’s not always the case. When students are young, academically brilliant and getting great grades, they should know that’s an option.”Last year he donated £9,000 to a crowdfunding initiative set up by a student from south-west London to enable her to study at Harvard.He said he coasted through GCSEs – he got six A*s, three As and three Bs according to the BBC – but “didn’t do too great at A-levels”.By offering the scholarships, he is following a number of rappers, including Jay-Z and Nicky Minaj in the US, where the practice is popular.The application deadline is 30 August for this year and is open to any black student with an offer to study at Cambridge, according to the BBC.The students will be selected by a panel of university staff.

In its statement, the royal college said:In 2015, Ministers sold their reform of nurse student funding as a way to boost student places and increase the number of trainees in England.Yet today’s UK-wide picture shows a two per cent drop across the four countries, from 21,030 students placed compared to 21,490 in 2017, and an eight per cent drop (from 22,830) since 2016.There has been a further fall in the number of mature nursing students since funding was removed in 2016, with numbers dropping ten per cent UK wide.In England the situation is even worse, with a 16 per cent drop (from 7,450 to 6,260) since student funding was removed in 2016.This could leave specialist areas worst hit by the wider staffing crisis, such as learning disability and mental health nursing, struggling to recruit.Both these areas rely on students with significant life experience - with fewer mature students due to start in September, today’s figures mean staffing levels could fall further.Link to the dataIn terms of outcomes females do better in design \u0026amp technology, physics and biology.

Luke Shaw sat his exams at Norwich School and gained an A* in maths, A grades in chemistry and politics and a B in further maths. He has an unconditional offer to the University of Nottingham where he plans to study economics, potentially with Spanish. Luke, of Bramerton, near Norwich, has just returned from a training camp in Bulgaria and will compete in the junior men’s category for GB at the kayak marathon world championships in Portugal next month. Standard distances for marathon kayak races are up to 30km, and he said he had to “squeeze in” training alongside his studies. “I’m hoping to get top 10, but hopefully better than top 10, we’ll see,” he said. “It’s interesting, a lot can happen in a marathon.” Head of school Phoebe Crane, 18, achieved an A* in biology and A grades in chemistry and maths despite missing weeks of study due to glandular fever. “It wasn’t the best. I mean I got it at Christmas, Boxing Day, and then I missed my mocks and had to come back quickly, it wasn’t too bad,” she said. She plans to study chemical engineering at Birmingham University, adding: “It’s such a relief.” Amid all the jubilation on A-level results day - the stories of triumph against adversity, the pictures of squealing girls with straigh A*s, the incessant tweets of university acceptance screengrabs - it’s sometimes easy to forget that it doesn’t go well for everyone. If that’s you, then you could do with reading this blog post by a student, Freya Marshall Payne, who missed her grades to go to Oxford, and what she did next.In the summer of 2015 I was looking forward to reading history at Oxford. I had worked so hard and the future was bright. All I needed was three A grades at A-level.Then came results day, and everything fell apart. I got a D in one English exam and missed the offer. I cried in public as friends disappeared to celebrate and strangers came to see if I was OK. I suddenly felt I had no control over my life and lost all self-belief.Read on to find out what Freya did next:Our graphics team have been hard at work making sense of the statistical tsunami that accompanies A-level results day. Here are the fruits of their labours.A-level results day is a cruel trick played on students, according to our columnist, Zoe Williams, who warns that we put youngsters under tremendous pressure yet still claim their grades are being devalued. It’s time we showed solidarity, she says in her latest oeuvre this morning. It’s A-level results day. You will know this already, because the  will have some pretty teenagers on its front page, except not in hats or prefixed “Lady”. Or maybe you have an 18-year-old of your own, in which case you will have woken, ashen, from a night plagued by terrors, a clan of hyenas – internationally recognised metaphor for the forces of marketisation – attacking your baby, while you are powerless to help because you’re trying on shoes.Despite a higher than ever rate of university entries (as pointed out by the DfE below), initial figures show that, in absolute terms, fewer students have been accepted on to UK degree courses this year.Ucas data shows that 411,860 have taken up places so far, down one per cent on the same point last year. It also shows that 353,960 UK students have been accepted on to courses, down two per cent.The drops come in the wake of a drop in applications to start degrees at UK universities this autumn, fuelled by factors including a fall in the UK’s 18-year-old population. Mark Herbert, director of schools and skills at the British Council, called the continuing decline in the number of pupils taking a modern language “a real concern”. He added: Against this overall downward trend, the increasing popularity of Chinese proves that our young people can be enthused to study languages. Our research shows that Mandarin will be one of the most important languages for the UK’s future prosperity and global standing – but we mustn’t neglect Spanish, French and German which will still be vital post-Brexit.Learning a foreign language doesn’t just boost job prospects by providing vital skills that employers are looking for, it also helps us understand other cultures and work internationally. We all need to encourage our young people to see the value of languages and embrace them as important subjects to study at A-level and beyond.The Department for Education has paid tribute to the “next generation of young people succeeding to gain the skills Britain needs”, in a statement pointing out that the university entry rate is the highest ever - and insisting that the reformed A-levels are “better preparing students for studying at university or the workplace”.Civil service media specialists have picked out the statistics they would like us to pay attention to, which include: Damian Hinds, the secretary of state for education, said:We’ve worked to improve education for every child – from their early years through to secondary school and beyond. I also want young people to have wider choice, whether that’s going to university, earning through an apprenticeship or in future taking technical qualifications that match the best in the world.Today is a significant milestone in the lives of many young people. No matter what path they choose to take next, we are working to make sure it provides them with a world-class education and a passport to an exciting future.Here are some key figures in this year’s A-level results, which have been picked out for us by the Press Association: The proportion of students in England gaining C grades or above in A-levels fell back this year, driven by a relatively weaker performance among girls as schools and students continue to grapple with the introduction of new, more intensive exams.The changes dragged down the overall UK pass rates, as the results in England contrasted with better performances in Wales and Northern Ireland, as more than half a million students across the three nations received their A-level results.Stormzy has said he hopes that a scholarship he is offering to help black Cambridge University students pay their tuition fees serves as a reminder to young people from all backgrounds that they have the opportunity to get the best education. The grime artist was speaking at Harris City Academy Crystal Palace in south London, where A-level students are opening their results. The Stormzy scholarship will pay for tuition fees and provide a maintenance grant for up to four years of an undergraduate course, BBC Newsbeat reported. The rapper said: “If you’re academically brilliant don’t think because you come from a certain community that studying at one of the highest education institutions in the world isn’t possible.”Stormzy’s scholarship will fund two students starting this year, and two more in 2019.

You’ve given it your bank account information, and use it to move your money around. It’s privy to your conversations with loved ones and work associates, perhaps even words uttered out loud in private moments. It knows your schedule, where you are at any given moment, what you buy, what music you listen to, and who you should date.Chris Paine’s new documentary Do You Trust This Computer? wonders if that might not contain some potential for disaster down the line.In fact, it’s really more of a film essay, in the methodical way it introduces, dissects, and draws conclusions from ideas applied to real-world developments. Having tried narrowing his focus to a single topic in the 2006 breakout Who Killed the Electric Car?, Paine decided to go wide for this project, weaving together far-reaching trends and headlines to form a more holistic meditation on the theme of technology.“With this film, we wanted to pick apart the stuff we take for granted,” Paine tells the . “We wanted to say, ‘What is the reality behind these things? Which anxieties are well-founded, and what’s just fear?’”It’s hard not to enter full-on panic mode as Paine blows through digital threats to life as we know it as if from apocalyptic flashcards. While advances like artificial intelligence, increased automation, and algorithmic learning have propelled humanity into a faster and more convenient future, they have paved the way for some chilling developments as well.“There are tentpole concerns,” Paine explains. “The danger of autonomous weapons, the danger of election tampering and other hacking, the hazards of overpersonalization – these are part of the ‘existential risk’ we’ve covered in the three years of working on this film … People are very fast to trust things that take care of them. We trust airplane autopilots, and we trust the FAA to make sure the pilot’s not flying under the influence or something. Like machines or governments, digital programs have a real relationship with the humans that use them. When we go to a computer program to buy from an online marketplace, purchase flight tickets, or book a hotel, we trust that the algorithms in place are giving us good information, the best prices.”The former head of an internet company that went under following the dotcom bubble’s big pop, Paine spent the interim years learning all he could about the technology sector. He sees humanity approaching a reckoning with itself, as we turn more of our high-level thought over to software and more of our physical function to automatons. To ensure that qualities like privacy, safety and agency don’t become things of the past, it falls to us to self-regulate.“There are simple ways to minimize your digital footprint,” Paine says. “Covering your phone and computer’s camera, so they’re not always broadcasting your face to whoever happens to have access to them is one. But with this film, the push is mostly to create awareness, to call on our congressional bodies to push back against companies like Apple and Google. You don’t have to throw away your computer and go completely offline – that’s just difficult to do, practically speaking.”He continues: “Changing the culture of technology requires getting different types of people into available jobs. More women, yes, but also people from the arts. People with a background in ethics, or philosophy. This idea of the outsiders having some measure of control could be a big part of the solution … It’s part legislation, part internal revision of the system.”Paine places an emphasis on action over terrified paralysis, offsetting each disturbing morsel of information with a whiff of hope. He doesn’t want to come off as the tinfoil-hatted luddite that tech giants often claim their most ardent opponents are. He’s more sober-minded than that, both aware of the stratospheric stakes and confident that managing them represents the only way forward. After all, he’s the first one to describe himself as a “technophile”. He zeroes in on a lack of awareness as the chief problem, citing the embarrassing showing from a congressional committee hearing that had to ask Mark Zuckerberg what Facebook does and how it produces money during his deposition. (In a film that features Elon Musk musing about his vision of digitized empire on camera, Zuckerberg stands out as the most glaring absence. “You know well enough how difficult it is to get a hold of him,” Paine joked. “ broke the Cambridge Analytica story.”)Paine contrasts that ignorance with the signing of the Copenhagen letter, part plea and part pledge for the world’s top innovators to do and be better. Mindfulness is key, the simple act of remaining conscious about the invisible ways daily life has been infiltrated by evolving machines. Common consumers cannot go half-cocked into the coming decades if we hope to survive under the small handful of billionaires calling more and more of the shots. Paine tries not to get too melodramatic over the course of his interview, but even he can’t deny that privileging healthy cynicism over blind faith could be a matter of life and death:“To a computer, the security systems of the world’s largest nuclear mainframes are just a game, so we need to be careful if we’re going to teach them to be master game-players.” He chuckles. “What could go wrong?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a41bd6937c01f19873b99587ea15a8990bf551fa/0_308_3423_2055/master/3423.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b563cebd5e777838cf040cac527fa38","title":"peterloo director mike leigh calls for 1819 massacre to be taught in uk schools","story":"Mike Leigh grew up near scene of Manchester atrocity but says he was never taught about itAll schoolchildren in the UK should be taught about the Peterloo massacre, according to Mike Leigh, who has directed a film about the little-known Manchester atrocity sometimes referred to as Britain’s Tiananmen Square.Leigh grew up in Salford, a short walk from St Peter’s Field, where on 16 August 1819 government forces charged into a peaceful rally by more than 60,000 people who were demanding political reform and protesting against poverty.Cavalry troops slashed at the crowd with sabres, and an estimated 18 protesters were killed and more than 650 injured, making it the bloodiest political clash in British history.Leigh, whose new film, Peterloo, tells the story of the slaughter, said he did not learn about it in school, and nor did most other people. “When we were making the film, a lot of us, in quite wide-ranging ages – I’m in my mid-70s and others were in their 20s – were all from the north-west, all saying: ‘I’d never heard of it.’”He added: “From where I grew up in Great Cheetham Street you could walk to where it happened in less than half an hour. No one took us out from school and marched us about to say ‘this happened here’, which is remarkable.”Manchester Histories, a charity, is leading the campaign for Peterloo to be taught in all schools. It has applied for money from the Heritage Lottery Fund to help schools teach about the attack, and it is developing a dedicated website and walking app on the subject and training a cohort of volunteers to become “Peterloo ninjas”.There is no explicit mention of Peterloo on the national curriculum, though the Department for Education said teachers were free to teach it if they wanted.Leigh said he saw parallels between England then and the country of today. “In the end, why is the film still relevant? Many reasons. One of them being the difference between those who have and those who don’t have. Those who have power and those who don’t. Those who have wealth and those who are on the breadline.”At the time of the massacre, the London-based government was ignorant of life outside the capital, said Leigh. The then home secretary, Henry Addington, who oversaw the ruthless crackdown on dissent that reached its bloody nadir at Peterloo, had never been to the north, Leigh discovered during his four years of research.The government saw those agitating in the north as “terrorists who had to be put down”, said Leigh. “But we know that these were people with a legitimate cause. Some of them were moderate and some of them more extreme.”The biggest problem Leigh had when shooting the £14m film was that Manchester had changed so much in the two centuries since Peterloo.“When we embarked on it, I said obviously we are going to shoot it in Manchester. Well, not a single frame of it is filmed in Manchester,” said Leigh, who shot the massacre scenes in Tilbury, Essex.The site of the battle is now unrecognisable, occupied by tooting trams, Manchester’s central library and the Midland hotel.Though Peterloo was filmed outside of the city, Manchester is to host a special presentation of the film, after the BFI London film festival decided to show a premiere film outside of the capital for the first time in its 62-year history.•Peterloo screens on 17 October at Manchester’s Home, followed by a Q\u0026ampA with the director and cast that will be simulcast to cinemas around the UK. It goes on general release on 2 November.

This richly compassionate, fiercely acted and beautifully shot period drama is about the second conflict, the battle of wills on the home front, as its characters struggle to maintain a family farm in the Deux-Sèvres region of western France.A way of life, with its Hardyesque seasonal rhythms of sowing and reaping, is minutely, sumptuously depicted. But all the time in the background – in the letters home, in the muttered hints of the grim-faced men on leave and their shellshocked dreams – is the horror of war. Those seasonal rhythms come to include regular visits from officials with telegrams.s is directed by Xavier Beauvois, terrifically shot by cinematographer Caroline Champetier, and adapted by Beauvois, Frédérique Moreau and the film’s editor Marie-Julie Maille from a 1924 novel by Ernest Pérochon, the teacher, Goncourt-winning author and first world war veteran who in 1940 refused to collaborate with the Vichy regime, had his books banned and finally died of a heart attack brought on by the stress of daily Gestapo harassment.Nathalie Baye gives a performance of effortless authority as the widowed Madame Hortense, the matriarch who must impose her will on the running of the farm. Her daughter Solange (played by Baye’s real-life daughter Laura Smet) is her most important worker, given that her father-in-law Henri (played by non-professional Gilbert Bonneau) is too elderly to do much. Smet plays Solange as a passionate woman who, like her mother, has accepted the patriotic duty of reining in her emotions. Her husband Clovis (Olivier Rabourdin) comes home from the front, angry at the hypocrisy and cruelty of war. The Germans, he tells them all, are just like them: workers, husbands, fathers.This is not quite what Solange’s enlisted brothers have to say on their visits home. Constant (Nicolas Giraud) is a decorated officer, a teacher in civilian life who, on an appearance in the classroom, listens with faintly pained reserve to his pupils eagerly reciting in his honour a poem attacking the “Boches” (Krauts). Most importantly, there is Georges (Cyril Descours), who is perhaps his mother’s favourite: she comes alive in his presence as she does not with Constant, and it is Georges’s longed-for visits that put into motion the film’s tragedy.Hortense has just hired a new worker, Francine, played by newcomer Iris Bry, who instantly impresses with her hard work and cheerful attitude. Georges is clearly smitten with the pretty, charming Francine they agree to write to each other when he returns to the front, and watchful Hortense is not displeased with this turn of events. She can imagine this young woman as a permanent addition to the household and even as a daughter-in-law. But Francine is an outsider, and the courtship enrages Marguerite (Mathilde Viseux), a longtime intimate of the family who had regarded herself as his intended. And then the Americans turn up: swaggeringly handsome young soldiers who are the source of terrible sexual tension and cause Hortense to make a dreadful mistake. Francine is to become a living victim of war.The beauty and the pathos of the film are vivid in every frame. Most unbearable is the shot in which Constant says his farewells before returning to the war and walks away from the farm up a shady country lane that leads back to the station: he turns and waves, framed by the trees, his brave, open face lit by a heartbreakingly good-natured smile. The terrible omen is obvious.Then there is the remarkable scene in which Georges takes Francine into the forest, which is part of the family’s estate – a magical place made even more mysterious by the standing stones there, which, incidentally, are a further reminder of Tess of the D’Urbervilles and Stonehenge. The stones’ presence imbues that whole place with something profoundly moving and erotic, and the woodland itself consecrates the love between Georges and Francine.The years are flashed up on screen as the time goes by: the harrowingly important years of 1914 and 1918, but then, without any great fanfare, we get 1919 and 1920. There is no war’s-over scene with dancing in the streets – or farmyard. Hardscrabble life goes on as it went on before the war, and the widowed Hortense was in any case used to running things without a husband. Beauvois concludes the film with an affecting, melancholy song. It is the music of regret and acceptance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c422781339c7710ee40a1b2d90907878e2ace1c6/0_162_4090_2455/master/4090.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=031808a6e47ee10ef1f016de6c7423bc","title":"la liga stage match us","story":"• Regular-season fixture could take place as early as this season• El Clásico would remain in Spain under proposalsLa Liga is set to stage a regular-season match in the United States, possibly as early as this year, but a clásico between Real Madrid and Barcelona is pretty much out of the question.The league said on Thursday it is planning to play a match across the Atlantic as part of a new 15-year partnership with the sports and entertainment group Relevent to promote the game in North America. The group operates the International Champions Cup, the world’s largest summer club tournament. Barcelona and Real Madrid faced each other in the tournament in Miami last year.La Liga gave few details on the planned regular-season game. The league president, Javier Tebas, however, dismissed the possibility of taking the clásico away from Spain. The league said it is still making arrangements for the game and there is no timetable for when it will happen, but it could be this season.The Spanish league has been trying to expand internationally for some time, hoping to grow and keep pace with the Premier League in England. Tebas last year also talked about the league possibly playing a regular-season match in China, and a few days ago the Spanish Super Cup was held in Tangier, Morocco, the first time it was played outside Spain. A league game in the US would be the first to be played outside of Europe.“Joining with Relevent to create La Liga North America is a major milestone in our international expansion strategy,” Oscar Mayo, the league’s international development director, said. “This agreement ensures not only a bright future for soccer in North America, but also for La Liga and our clubs.”The league added: “The operation will support the league’s growth in the US and Canada through consumer-related activities including youth academies, development of youth soccer coaches, marketing agreements, consumer activations, exhibition matches and plans to have an official La Liga Santander match played in the US.”A decade ago, the Premier League tried to introduce an additional international match but plans for each team to play a 39th game overseas were abandoned amid opposition from Fifa and fan groups.The Premier League has more exposure than its Spanish counterpart in the US, in part because of a six-year TV deal with NBC worth about $1bn. Since 2012, the Spanish league has been on Bein Sports, which was received by less than a quarter of American English-language television households even before it recently was dropped by the Comcast Xfinity cable system.Relevent was founded and is owned by Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, who called the partnership “the next giant leap in growing soccer’s popularity in North America”. He added: “This unique relationship will create new opportunities for millions of North American soccer fans to experience the most passionate, exciting, and highest level of soccer in the world.”The Spanish league called the agreement “an inflection point for soccer in the US and Canada,” coming in anticipation of the 2026 World Cup that will be hosted in North America."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a0ad9dbc889f85562082b457cd5ff6e70253d36/1168_382_3587_2151/master/3587.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e871ffe7685d83bc92b2afb75996360","title":"uefa super cup loss real madrid post ronaldo negativity","story":"Julen Lopetegui’s side conceded four goals for the first time since 2015 against Atlético Madrid, and the lack of galáctico signings add to the sense of a downward driftIt was only the Uefa Super Cup.

But none of that matters: what matters is that Ronaldo has gone and Real Madrid lost.Discussion of narrative in football tends to prompt a roll of the eyes but, much like gods, even if narratives are false or nonexistent they can exert a powerful influence. They are a way of ordering thoughts, of making sense of often random events, and by generating moods they can shape events. And for Real Madrid, defeat in Tallinn slipped all too neatly into a mounting narrative of negativity.“For the most part we were better,” said Madrid’s new coach, Julen Lopetegui, “but we couldn’t take advantage of that fact and they made good use of all the chances they had.” That may not have been strictly accurate, but it was broadly true, and that adds to the sense of concern something has changed. In the past few years, particularly in the Champions League, Real Madrid have often prevailed despite not being better, at times almost inexplicably so.Except there has always been an explanation: Cristiano Ronaldo. There may have been times when he left Madrid vulnerable by failing to fulfil his defensive functions. There may have been times when his demand everything should orbit around him cost Madrid fluidity, but he averaged 50 goals a season for nine years. Get the ball somewhere near him in a dangerous position and the chances were he would score. That may be a method too haphazard to win many league titles – just two in those nine years – but in the knockout rounds of the Champions League it has proved devastatingly effective, and is not easily replicated.But there is a psychological dimension as well. Remove a star and a little darkness inevitably falls, particularly when there has been no compensatory signing of a galáctico. At most clubs, the departure of a 33-year-old and the extra opportunities consequently afforded to young domestic talent such as Isco, Marco Asensio and Lucas Vázquez could be spun as a positive, but Madrid is a club whose self-image in built on big signings, and this season there have been none.Perhaps that’s a little unfair on Thibaut Courtois, but in the modern world goalkeepers are rarely perceived as stars. The Belgian aside, the only arrivals have been the 18-year-old Brazilian Vinícius Júnior, completing a deal agreed last year, and the 22-year-old winger Álvaro Odriozola. Talk of Neymar, Kylian Mbappé and Eden Hazard has come to nothing. There is still time, of course, but for now there is a continuation of the downward drift that began with Ronaldo hinting at his departure in the bowels of the Olimpiyskiy in Kyiv minutes after the Champions League final and continued with the mistimed and misjudged announcement of the appointment of Lopetegui to succeed Zinedine Zidane on the eve of the World Cup.On the pitch, Madrid perhaps pressed with a little more purpose than they had – Lopetegui, after all, although he began his playing career at Madrid, was at Barcelona for the tail-end of Johan Cruyff’s reign – but were otherwise unremarkable.Gareth Bale was threatening in the first half, and set up Karim Benzema’s goal, but faded in the second. Benzema, so used to playing off Ronaldo, at times dropped deep in a way that, with neither Bale or Marco Asensio making runs beyond him, meant there was a lack of a target in the box. Sergio Ramos’s elbows remained as sharp as ever, but both he and Raphaël Varane were oddly diffident at times. Marcelo demonstrated once again that he is a fine attacking full-back and an ordinary defensive one.None of it was anything particularly out of the ordinary for a first game of the season, and but for some very fine finishing from Atlético, it might not even have meant defeat. But they did lose, and so the narrative of negativity gathers pace. Madrid never conceded four in a game under Zidane. They hadn’t lost in a continental final in 18 years. And they have lost Ronaldo. Lopetegui insisted defeat would not change transfer policy, and statement signings made without thought to the overall structure rarely work, but a big arrival may be the simplest way to shift Madrid out of the shadow of Ronaldo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3949bba4c0a0dac09767b5cc818d2b2ea48c9dd6/0_52_2147_1288/master/2147.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3a5358aa29ccc3cdfe12f5d4e372463","title":"not weekend for premier league underdog football weekly","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Archie Rhind-Tutt and Mark Langdon to review the first Premier League weekend of the season, Liverpool’s impressive start, same old Arsenal (or is it?), Luke Shaw’s release from wherever José Mourinho was hiding him and a foul from BurundiRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Here are a few of themOf all the players who seemed to play football with a passion and joie de vivre, Batistuta seemed among the most passionate and joiest de vivrest. Those lusty shots, those screaming celebrations, those goals. But, it seems, he wasn’t especially keen on football. “I do not like football, it is just my profession,” he once said in an interview with Argentinian TV.The man who helped Batistuta write his autobiography seemed to confirm this. “He is not like other players,” Alessandro Rialti told the Sunday Times in 1999. “Once he leaves the stadium, he doesn’t want football encroaching upon the rest of his life. When we were doing the book, he came to my office and for five full days he spoke about his family and his life in Argentina. But when it came to the football and his career, he switched off. ‘The records are there,’ he said. ‘You can look them up.’” When Blackburn had a reunion of their 1994-95 Premier League title-winning side in 2015, only one member of the squad didn’t turn up. Since retiring in 2004, Batty has broadly gone off grid, not keen to join in the traditional carousel of punditry and personal appearances. This is just a man happy to live his life, not let his career dominate his existence.The extent to which Batty actively disliked football is perhaps exaggerated by his absence from the game. In this interview with The City Talking he says a few times how much he loved certain aspects of football, but every now and then reminders of a man who kept the game in perspective – too much perspective, if anything – pop up. Like this description of international football: “When you make your debut for England, at the very beginning, it’s the pinnacle of your career … and then it just becomes normal. Yeah, you play in the World Cup, but it’s still just another game in a different country.” So perhaps this was closer to a healthy detachment. “I was always a home bird, so I’d go play and then I just loved getting home,” he said. “That never changed. At the World Cup, as soon as we got in the changing rooms after the shootout, I was looking forward to getting home and seeing my kids – so football didn’t matter. I could detach. I’d give my all. And then that was me finished with football.” It’s still strangely taboo for footballers to admit they’re just doing this for the money. Like various art forms, for some reason people still expect them to be driven by a higher purpose: because lots of people like playing football, and would like to be footballers, the idea that actual footballers should thus ignore the broader concerns of earning as good a living as they can is weirdly still common.Assou-Ekotto wasn’t afraid of admitting his primary motivation, though. “If I play football with my friends back in France, I can love football,” he told the  in 2010. “But if I come to England, where I knew nobody and I didn’t speak English … why did I come here? For a job. A career is only 10, 15 years. It’s only a job. Yes, it’s a good, good job and I don’t say that I hate football but it’s not my passion. “You read the paper, it’s like a movie,” he continued. “Very bizarre … only in England. That’s why football is not my passion because when you are professional, the world of football is not good.” At the 1998 World Cup, before Italy faced France in the quarter-finals, a group of French journalists asked Vieri who his childhood idol was. “Allan Border,” came the reply, to bemused faces. Vieri was born in Bologna but raised in Sydney, which is where Border – rather than Paolo Rossi, Bruno Conti or Toto Schillaci – became his idol, and cricket his first love. “To be honest I wasn’t very good at football,” he said. “I loved cricket and when I started making some big scores for my boys’ team, I dreamed of becoming the next Border.” Quite a handy player in his youth, he might even have made a decent professional cricketer, but the practicalities of playing the game in Italy and, to be frank, the remuneration on offer made football a more viable option. “I would have loved to have been a cricketer,” he said in 2003. “I was telling a friend last week, I would stop playing now to play cricket if I could get the same contract. I was a bit of an all-rounder at school.” Football’s arrogance is such that we assume everyone regards it as the absolute pinnacle, but this is a man who, in an ideal world, would simply rather be doing something else. Many can probably sympathise with that. People think football is fun because they remember having fun playing it as a kid. Or, they have fun in their Sunday league team, or at their weekly five-a-side. But, when you listen to the way some who have played professionally talk about it, the game sounds like more trouble than it’s worth. People like Baardsen, for example, the former Spurs and Watford goalkeeper who retired aged 25 before going on to work as a fund manager. Speaking to the Observer in 2008, he said: “You wouldn’t think a person working in the city could say this, but I’m more relaxed, five kilos lighter, fitter and healthier than I was at the end of my football career. Football is stressful, try playing in front of 40,000 crazy football supporters who are happy or sad for their whole weekend depending on how you perform. Never mind all the people criticising you on TV.”It might be stretching things a bit to say Bale doesn’t like football. Playing, he’s very much on board with: his keenness when it comes to international football, particularly in comparison to some previous high-profile Welsh players, is proof enough. When he’s not on the pitch though, he’s not so fussed. While players such as Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry were famous for watching as many games as they could feasibly fit into their schedules, Bale would rather do other things with his time. “I don’t really watch much football,” he said to ESPN earlier this year. “I’d rather watch the golf to be honest.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebfa33dd993c0f98b44ab16a6eb668ddd6483024/1092_844_2522_1513/master/2522.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8387f8ce2d0a79906ca7a018886ddde5","title":"not enough fish woman successfully sues dating agency seventy thirty","story":"Seventy Thirty misled Tereza Burki on true number of male members, judge rulesA orcee seeking a wealthy boyfriend has won £13,100 in damages from an elite dating agency after it failed to introduce her to the match she hoped would be “possibly the man of my dreams, the father of my child”.Tereza Burki had sued Seventy Thirty, based in Knightsbridge, central London, for deceit and misrepresentation. On Wednesday the high court ruled it had misled the businesswoman about its “exclusive” membership.Delivering the ruling, Judge Richard Parkes QC said: “Gertrude Stein quipped that whoever said money can’t buy happiness didn’t know where to shop.“This case is about a woman looking for romantic happiness who says she was tricked into shopping in the wrong place, paying a large sum to a dating agency which, she says, made promises but failed to produce the goods.”Burki, 47, a mother of three who lives in Chelsea, approached the dating service in 2013 in pursuit of a new partner. “Her requirements were not modest,” the judge observed.What she wanted was a “sophisticated gentleman”, ideally employed in the finance industry. It was important that he should lead a “wealthy lifestyle” and be “open to travelling internationally”.Her most important requirement was a willingness to have more children since she had always wanted four. Burki was encouraged by what she read about Seventy Thirty and eventually signed up, paying £12,600.The judge said the agency’s then managing director, Lemarc Thomas, claimed there was a substantial number of wealthy male members actively engaged in its matchmaking services who were a sufficient match for Burki’s desires.This was false and misleading, said the judge, because there were only about 100 active male members altogether. That number could not “by any stretch of the imagination” be described as a substantial number, even without considering how far that number would have to be reduced to allow for compliance with her criteria.“Had Ms Burki known what the true size of the active membership was, she would not have joined Seventy Thirty,” he said. She was induced to enter her contract with the agency by the false representations given by Thomas, who must have known he was giving her a wholly false impression, he added.In her legal action, Burki sought the return of her membership fee and damages for distress. The agency counter-sued her for libel and malicious falsehood in connection with two online reviews she wrote.The judge awarded her £12,600 damages for deceit and £500 for distress. He awarded Seventy Thirty £5,000 for libel relating to an April 2016 Google review by Burki.Ruling on the agency’s libel claim, Parkes said he had not found the business was a fundamentally dishonest or fraudulent operation, although at the time it probably had a short supply of suitable men.Had Thomas explained to Burki that the database included active members, former members who still wished to be matched, and people who had been headhunted and had agreed to be put on the database in the hope of finding a suitable partner, she would have had little cause for complaint, Parkes said. Susie Ambrose, the founder and company director of Seventy Thirty, said Burki had joined with the “lofty and unrealistic” expectations of how many men she would be introduced to through the agency.“We are a niche, exclusive agency, not a mainstream, mass-market online dating service. We are not going to have thousands of members because there simply aren’t thousands of single, wealthy, high-calibre prospects out there,” Ambrose said.She added: “By her own admission in court, Ms Burki never read the terms and conditions … Ms Burki was found to have libelled Seventy Thirty, as the judge said that we had sourced excellent matches for her. Therefore, her remarks about us being a non-reputable and fraudulent company were deemed untrue and entirely without foundation.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac7c0ab042230838c3bf83754ed7765793fbfb6d/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd0e449f1469bb25f36ead5777af238c","title":"good nights sleep cure loneliness","story":"New studies have shown that sleep deprivation can make people feel lonely – and social isolation can disrupt sleep. It is vital to break the vicious cycleHere is a new problem to keep you awake at night: could sleep deprivation be affecting your social life? Not in the sense that you’re too tired to go out – although it could mean that, too – but could your very sleeplessness be off-putting to other people?In another experiment, 1,000 people were asked to rate photographs of people – some in a sleep-deprived state – according to how socially attractive they seemed. The sleep-deprived people came off worse. And the researchers concluded that sleep-related alienation could “trigger the transmission of loneliness” – after viewing clips of sleep-deprived people, otherwise healthy and happy participants then felt lonelier.“We humans are a social species. Yet sleep deprivation can turn us into social lepers,” said Matthew Walker, a professor of psychology and neuroscience and the senior author of the study, who wrote the bestselling book Why We Sleep. “The less sleep you get, the less you want to socially interact. In turn, other people perceive you as more socially repulsive, further increasing the grave social-isolation impact of sleep loss. That vicious cycle may be a significant contributing factor to the public health crisis that is loneliness.”Last year, a study of 2,000 young adults by researchers at King’s College London found lonelier people had poorer-quality sleep, were more likely to feel tired and had more difficulty focusing on tasks during the day than those who didn’t report feeling lonely. “It could be that feeling you’re all on your own in the world, a fundamentally unsafe feeling, could make it difficult to have a restful night’s sleep,” says Timothy Matthews, a research associate at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London. “And that, in turn, could mean you’re not at your best and you don’t get the best out of your social interactions, which could increase feelings of loneliness.”There could be an evolutionary element, he says. “Some scientists believe that loneliness is part of our evolutionary heritage, because our ancestors would stick together in groups in order to succeed. If you have an aversion to being cut off from the group, that would have served an adaptive purpose. If you feel you’re alone, that’s comparable to feeling unsafe. The world seems a more threatening place and that perception could make it difficult to have a more restful sleep because you’re more on guard for your safety.”Could it be useful for people to keep in mind that poor sleep could be a reason for their feelings of loneliness? “Loneliness is really complex and you can’t put it down to one thing,” she says. “I think we would say it would be a factor, but we’d need to look at other factors, too.” Things such as health problems and economic status “are big factors in loneliness. If you have ill-health or you are worried about money, that is probably going to keep you up, so it can all become part of this vicious cycle.”But for some people experiencing loneliness, the idea that poor-quality sleep can be improved, and can reduce their social isolation, may be a wake-up call."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/748578e8f77db113959ab3acfa9d00b8640c307c/0_49_3952_2371/master/3952.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=118169d5706ad871cc758463193acee1","title":"uk watchdog investigate payments social media influencers","story":"Concerns influencers are not declaring when they have been paid to post about productsThe competition watchdog has launched an investigation over concerns social media personalities are not declaring when they have been paid to post about products and experiences.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said social media influencers have the power to sway the shopping habits of millions with posts endorsing goods or services, but they may not be disclosing that they have been paid to do so.The CMA cited examples of posts that appeared to promote or endorse a product, or offered a celebrity’s personal opinion on the benefit of a product, without clearly disclosing if they were being paid by the brand.It has written to a range of celebrities and social media influencers to “gather more information about their posts and the nature of the business agreements they have in place with brands”.It is also asking the public to share their experiences as part of the investigation, and said it was particularly interested in hearing from people who had bought products endorsed on social media.Typically, celebrities and influencers have millions of followers who watch their channels to see where they go on holiday, what they wear, which products they use, the books they read and more. Online endorsements from celebrities and influencers can help brands reach target audiences and boost sales.But influencers must make clear in such posts that they have been paid or rewarded to promote, review or talk about a product under consumer protection law.The CMA said followers could be led to believe that an endorsement represented a celebrity’s own view, rather than being a paid-for promotion, if they did not label their posts properly.It said it was investigating the extent to which influencers were clearly and accurately identifying any commercial relationships and whether people were being misled.George Lusty, the CMA’s senior director for consumer protection, said: “Social media stars can have a big influence on what their followers do and buy. If people see clothes, cosmetics, a car, or holiday being plugged by someone they admire, they might be swayed into buying it.“So, it’s really important they are clearly told whether a celebrity is promoting a product because they have bought it themselves, or because they have been paid or thanked in some way by the brand.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1db180a34029c447927ad6916771821705f8c1a6/0_0_2000_1333/master/2000.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c1af35472e45044173be6e24b8431a0","title":"study law to open up a world of opportunities","story":"Politician, lecturer, human rights campaigner – a law degree will set you on the path for a career at the top Not only does a law degree or postgraduate course open up a wide variety of careers within the legal sector – it can also set you up for a future career at the top, in anything from business to politics.International law, for example, is a fascinating and fast-moving area. Mariam Munang took her bar professional training course (BPTC) at the University of Law, and is currently based in New York as an associate legal officer at the United Nations. Munang says that her time at the University of Law – which has 10 centres across the UK – gave her the skills and confidence to get to her current position. “I chose to study there because of its strong emphasis on honing practical legal skills, such as drafting and advocacy,” she says. “I prepare for trial in much the same way as I prepared for mock trials at the University of Law. The BPTC gave me the space and opportunity to make errors, learn from them, and hone my own style.”Baroness Shami Chakrabarti is one of many lawyers who choose to use their skills in the political world. She received an honorary doctorate from the University of Law, where she is now a mentor to students. She’s a member of the House of Lords, a politician, a barrister and a former director of human rights group Liberty. “I am proud to be the shadow attorney general in a shadow cabinet of many lawyers and many more colleagues who champion human rights and the rule of law,” she says. “During my time at Liberty, we defeated proposals to lock people up for 42 days without charge, halted ID cards, and won important victories on issues like stop-and-search.”One of the proudest moments of her career, she says, came when the Human Rights Act was passed. “In a sense, there’s no such thing as human rights law, only a whole host of legal and policy areas that engage people’s human rights,” she says. “Human rights are a powerful shield against abuse of power.” Simon Firth, partner at Linklaters LLP and visiting professor, says teaching those at the start of their careers is one of the best aspects of his job. “I love explaining the principles of the subject I am covering,” he says. “The University of Law has a very practical approach to preparing students for legal practice. That means trainees are effective from the moment they start training contracts.” As graduation approaches, the university’s award-winning careers service offers students guidance on achieving ambitions – another step to set them up for success.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan graduated from the University of Law Guildford with Law Society finals, the predecessor to the LPC. “At the University of Law I really valued the support of my fellow students, my lecturers and my tutors,” he says. “They kept my motivation levels up through many long days and late nights of revision.”Khan, who grew up on a south London council estate, was a human rights lawyer before entering politics. In 2016, he won the largest personal mandate in British political history to become mayor of London. His legal background provided vital experience for the world of politics, he says. “I was a member of parliament for my home town in Tooting before becoming the mayor for all Londoners,” he says. “As a human rights lawyer, I defended people who were victims of discrimination and that made me more determined than ever to fight injustice wherever I see it.” Visit the University of Law for more information"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e2ff1de818bd09248d29d6ce0e1221811da3159/0_371_1554_932/master/1554.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53697f9860e8e6366cab47e9bc3df17c","title":"conservatives call for lord sheikh to be expelled from party","story":"Peer says criticism he faces for attending same Palestinian conference as Jeremy Corbyn is motivated by IslamophobiaA Conservative peer has said that calls for him to be expelled from the party because he attended the same Palestinian rights conference as Jeremy Corbyn are motivated by Islamophobia and his criticism of Boris Johnson.Lord Sheikh has faced criticism for attending the 2014 event in Tunisia in the wake of a furore surrounding the Labour leader’s presence there and claims that Corbyn was involved in commemorating Black September terrorists behind the Munich Olympics attack in 1972. These claims have been described as “false and misleading” by the party.On Wednesday, Tory MPs Robert Halfon and Zac Goldsmith complained that Sheikh was in breach of the party’s code of conduct, while Goldsmith tweeted that he should be “immediately expelled”.Responding to the complaints on Thursday, Sheikh insisted that he was not antisemitic and suggested he has been targeted because he is Muslim and because he criticised Johnson’s controversial comments about the burqa.The Tory peer took particular umbrage at the involvement of Goldsmith, a close friend of Johnson, who defended the foreign secretary’s comments likening Muslim women to letterboxes, and who was accused of trying to exploit anti-Muslim feeling when he stood for mayor of London against Sadiq Khan.Sheikh told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think the complaints against me are politically motivated, I think the complaint against me is totally trivial and I think these people, whoever are trying to complain against me, are perhaps doing this because I have talked about what Boris Johnson has said being wrong.”He continued: “I was very surprised about the fact that Zac Goldsmith has made the complaint. When Zac Goldsmith was standing for mayor at the election, he made some unsavoury remarks about Sadiq Khan and that campaign backfired and I feel Zac Goldsmith should have learnt following his failure to be elected mayor of London.”Asked if he believed the complaint was motivated by Islamophobia, he replied: “I presume so.”Sheikh said he is a member of the all party parliamentary group on antisemitism and promoted good relationships between different communities. He said he had gone to the Tunisian conference to speak about the Arab Spring and settlements in Palestine.Challenged about the title of the conference – the International Conference on Monitoring the Palestinian Political and Legal Situation in the Light of Israeli Aggression – Sheikh said he was not aware of it.“I did not meet any members of Hamas,” he said. “I was not aware that there were people there who had extreme views. I am totally against extremism, I am totally against any form of terrorism.”In their letter to the Conservative party board, Halfon and Goldsmith wrote: “We cannot, as a party, rightly and robustly criticise the leader of the opposition for his attendance at this conference while allowing the attendance of a Conservative peer at the same event to pass without comment or complaint. To do so would be to indulge in hypocrisy and double standards.”Another Tory peer, Andrew Percy, has reportedly filed a separate complaint about Sheikh and called for the whip to be suspended."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fdff98f37cc9745e76c0557290b8589dd5a1475/0_1_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20e2d8aba43801b331f0b3a44fcf51ee","title":"allotments share your pictures","story":"Far more than just a plot of land, the UK’s allotments are some of our most treasured green spaces.

NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) reported in 2016 that 547 families had vetoed donations since April 2010 despite being informed that their relative had opted in to the register. It said an estimated 1,200 people had missed out on potential life-saving transplants as a result.For the study, published in Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied on Thursday, 1,294 adults from the US and Europe were presented with fictional scenarios and asked to ascertain the wishes of the potential donor.The researchers found that regardless of where the participants came from they perceived the donor’s underlying preference to donate as stronger under default opt-in and mandated choice systems (where participants have to express a preference) compared with default opt-out and mandatory donor systems.Osman said the increase in the number of people on the organ register would also be futile if the necessary infrastructure was not in place. There needed to be the hospitals and staff to carry out transplants as well as nurses to work with families of potential donors, she said. An internal NHSBT document has voiced similar concerns.Jackie Doyle-Price, minister for heath inequalities, said: “We believe that by making these changes, we will save and transform hundreds of lives every year.“But organ donation remains a gift ... We know this new system alone will not break down every barrier. We need to address myths and misconceptions around donation, and we will only do this by having informed debate and dialogue, which will be fostered by these proposals.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c22690a7831002e93855c4f4cb3c954484a7482f/0_0_3978_2387/master/3978.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d04fd64482e548bbc8a101f5b51c4bed","title":"nokia 8110 4g review nostalgia the matrix banana phone","story":"The original was made famous by The Matrix, and some might want to drop this reboot out of the nearest window tooThe new Nokia 8110 4G is the latest nostalgia trip from HMD Global, but is it more than just a remake of that “banana phone” from the Matrix?HMD had a hit on its hands with the new Nokia 3310 from last year, which was a surprisingly charming dumbphone that cost slightly more than other basic Nokias because of the name.The re-envisioned Nokia 8110 4G goes further, but not necessarily for the better.For those who never had the original 8110 in 1996, it was a curved mobile with a slider, whose primary claim to fame was being dropped out of an office block window by a clumsy Keanu Reeves in the 1999 sci-fi blockbuster.The 2018 version displays only a passing resemblance to the original. Gone is the stubby aerial and small monochrome screen, replaced with a larger, colour screen and shorter slider. The keypad doesn’t look anything like the original, either. You could say that only the name is the same.The curved back comes off to expose the battery, two sim slots and a microSD slot. The manual slider exposes the keypad and unlocks the phone, but doesn’t contain the phone’s microphones so it’s really only there for aesthetic purposes. You can hang up on someone by slamming the slider closed though, so there’s that.The top of the phone has a microUSB socket for charging and a headphone socket for listening to music or the built-in FM radio.The button configuration and menu system is the same as last year’s new 3310. A select button is ringed by a D-pad and flanked by two action keys, a call and a hangupback button. Below is a standard 12-button dial pad, of which the last row is surprisingly difficult to press because of the slider.The Nokia 8110 4G runs KaiOS, which is a sort of dumbphone-smartphone hybrid. It looks and behaves like the old series 30, but has things such as an app store, Google Assistant, YouTube, Google Maps, email, a browser and, of course, Snake.Google Assistant works surprisingly well, YouTube works just about, and you can even sync your Google or Outlook contacts, if you can face typing out your password using the numeric pad, which took me the best part of 10 minutes.Google Maps is slow but usable too, while the browser can just about handle sites like the .Despite having an app store, there’s no WhatsApp (although apparently it’s coming), Facebook Messenger, Snapchat, Instagram, Uber or Spotify. There is Twitter though, if you can bear it.Bashing out messages is about as tedious as you can expect using the cramped T9 keypad, but it can be done, which is pretty much the experience of the whole phone – most things can be done with enough patience.The phone comes with 4GB of storage, which is ided into 2GB for apps and 2GB for media, such as photos and music, if you want to sideload it on there. You can also insert a microSD card for more storage if you really need it.Battery life is about four to five days with my heavy usage, or 25 days of 4G standby according to HMD.It has one, it is two megapixels and it works, but don’t expect miracles. It’ll do in a pinch, but it won’t match even the worst cameras from a modern smartphone. It records video too, but there’s no selfie camera, so you’ll have to do the old flip-round and hope for the best.With the Nokia 8110 4G HMD has produced a much more capable retro phone than the equally nostalgic new 3310. You can get your email on it, you can get Google Maps, YouTube, Google Assistant and even sync all your contacts and calendar. It even has a modern 4G data connection, and an app store of sorts.But by including all these things, the 8110 4G is a little too connected for a retro-phone that many may seek out to be less connected to the world. And when you actually try and use these modern services afforded by KaiOS you quickly discover the tedium of trying to use a number pad and its T9 predictive text.If you want a festival phone just for texts and calls, there are cheaper and better dumbphones available that aren’t branded as a reboot of something from your youth. Ditto for those who don’t want or can’t afford a smartphone.The Nokia 8110 4G is a nice little novelty toy, then, but I’d rather have the new 3310 for that.Cons: expensive, tedious T9, not many apps, no WhatsApp, Spotify or Instagram This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

It is the world’s most northerly botanical garden, with a landscaped rock garden and a huge variety of plants overseen by the university since 1994, including colourful native, Himalayan and Patagonian varieties. The garden has examples of a buttercup that grows wild only on Svalbard and is one of the rarest plants in Europe. The garden meanders up the hill just to the north of Tromsø with views over the fjord, and has a cafe serving the most remarkable waffle topping ever encountered (Norwegian brown cheese with plum jam).

There’s a citrus garden, a tropical garden, vineyards, and an area dedicated to aromatic herbs. Butterflies and birds abound. The White Mountains form a spectacular backdrop to the three-hour walk round the park and your reward is an outstanding restaurant, specialising in local produce.

When I visited it was not awash with tourists it felt like a well-kept secret. On a sunny dry island off Naples, it forms an almost tropical oasis, shaded from the heat and covered in beautiful cascading flowers and exotic ferns, with several beautiful fountains dotted around a valley and a hill garden. It also has an open-air theatre and concert hall, where classical performances are held.

We called in on a rainy day en route home from Pembrokeshire and stayed all day. There is a phenomenal glasshouse with what is claimed to be the world’s largest single- glass roof (120 metres long), filled with Mediterranean and South American plants. The outside areas, covering 230 hectares, were also impressive, with an array of native planting including many varieties of Welsh apple tree, and water is woven throughout the gardens. There was pond-dipping for children, with experts on hand to identify the catch.

Born to a teenage mother who either didn’t know about it or doesn’t want anyone else to know, the baby immediately gets flushed down the loo. Pushed out of one pipe, just the very briefest experience of daylight, then sluiced straight down another one.And the new one is the worst kind of pipe. The teenager lives in a Los Angeles tower block – we’re talking shared waste pipe here – so it’s not just the poor baby going down it but the raw sewage, too. And where will it end up? In an LA sewer, with rats and alligators, most probably pythons as well ....But then the baby gets stuck, next to the apartment of a skater stoner, who doesn’t know whether the crying he’s hearing is coming from inside the wall or from inside his own fuzzy head. Luckily, he dials 9-1-1 anyway. Yes, it’s that kind of 9-1-1 (Sky Witness), not a terrorist attack on the other side of the country, or a Porsche. Hence the hyphens, I guess no pythons but hyphens.Anyway, quick! There’s a barely born baby stuck behind a wall. Things are on the verge of being grimmer as it is very nearly hacked to pieces because the LAFD show up and young firefighter Buck is about to go at the wall with his axe. Buck is a handsome fool, in the firefighting game to drive a big red fire truck and rescue pretty ladies. Luckily, fire chief Bobby is wiser and smarter, and decides that cutting around the baby would be a better approach.Meanwhile, on the floors above, Athena (Angela Bassett she gets named because I’ve heard of her) of the LAPD is rushing around banging on doors, telling people not to flush. She is a bit distracted, though, and has her own problems at home, because her husband of 20-odd years has just come out and she’s cross about that.Sounds exciting? Well, it is quite exciting, I suppose, in a will-they-won’t-they-in-time? kind of way. What I am not getting is any kind of emotional human rapid response. We don’t know anything of the new mum to care much about her. It’s all about the emergency services personnel, Athena and Bobby and Buck they’re shiny sure, but paper thin, cut from a glossy magazine and, to be honest, I don’t care much about them, either. Bobby has got a few demons in his locker, but they, too, are perfunctory: booze, God (born again perhaps?), a jumper who jumped after he failed to talk her down.Phone operator Abby may be a little more interesting. She has no life at home – boyfriend left, mum’s got Alzheimer’s – so she gets emotionally involved with the people on the other end of the phone and their plights. But God, some of the dialogue sucks. “You know, it takes a certain kind of person to swim in the pain of the world and not get wet,” she says.9-1-1 is an odd one. Created, along with Tim Minear, by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, who together gave birth to Glee, it shares some of that show’s pace and slick campness – but with sirens instead of singing, and minus the joy. To be honest, I’m not quite sure whether I am meant to be sitting on the edge of my seat, biting my nails, or rolling around on the floor, laughing. And, in the end, I’m not really doing any of it. Or caring an awful lot.The action comes thick and fast. There are more people to be rescued: a home-alone little girl, suddenly not alone when a pair of bad dudes break in. And here, at last, is a python, wrapped around a woman, slowly squeezing the life out of her. Buck the schmuck finally gets to wield his axe. Now, maybe do the same to the show?

The 29-storey glass-fronted skyscraper towers over the low-rise historic centre of La Paz.For Morales and his supporters, it represents a new Bolivia, a break from a painful colonial past. For others it is an overpriced vanity project aimed at glorifying the country’s longest-serving leader.Public disquiet turned to outrage when it was reported Morales would enjoy a 1,068 sq metre suite fitted out with a jacuzzi, sauna, gym and massage room. Other luxuries included a private lift, according to architectural plans leaked to local newspaper Pagina Siete.Bolivia’s communications minister, Gisela López, refused to confirm or deny the report but said the high-rise had been built “for the people” without running over a $34m budget, the state news agency reported.But the building has also become a focal point for growing anger at Morales’ refusal to relinquish power after 12 years and his vow to run for a fourth term in the country’s 2019 elections.Amid street protests, Morales inaugurated the building last Thursday.“We leave behind the palace of a colonial state to come here to the People’s Great House of the plurinational state of Bolivia,” he said in a speech, which listed the many presidents and independence leaders who had been killed inside or near the old palace during Bolivia’s tumultuous past.“It’s another historic milestone thanks to the struggle of the Bolivian people.”At 120 metres tall, the newly completed People’s Great House or Casa Grande del Pueblo looms overthe old government palace, which it replaces.Known as the Burned Palace or Palacio Quemado, the old building – which was twice gutted by fire – will now become a museum.Its replacement flouts municipal bylaws prohibiting high-rise constructions in the city centre but Morales used his party’s parliamentary majority to override the ban.“It’s an insult to the country,” Carlos Toranzo, a political analyst, told the . “(Morales) wants to immortalise himself with a building which is not only anti-aesthetic but also anti-ethical because in Bolivia we don’t have even the right to be ill,” he added, referring to the city’s woefully under-resourced main hospital.Opposition leader Samuel Doria said the new building should be turned into a cancer hospital which, he insists, is an urgent necessity in the country that remains one of South America’s poorest, despite a decade of strong growth.But Morales has brushed off criticism, saying the construction will save government spending by housing, along with the presidential and administrative offices – five ministries that currently rent quarters costing about $20m a year.Topped with a helipad and with three underground floors, the glass-fronted tower has architectural features resembling Tiwanaku, Bolivia’s preeminent archeological site. It features indigenous symbols such as the chakana, or Andean cross, and has several large murals, some of which depict workers overcoming social injustice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9f644ad995eccac984934c4b02a6285b8c816da/0_346_4292_2576/master/4292.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6da035308dcc8753548ce5d068a959f0","title":"regreening niger how magical gaos transformed land","story":"Farmers in Niger are nurturing gao trees to drive Africa’s biggest environmental changeRain had come to nearby villages, but not yet to Droum in south-east Niger. The sand under its stately trees looked completely barren, but Souley Cheibou, a farmer in his 60s, was not worried. He crooked a finger, fished in the sand, and brought out a millet seed. In a week or two, this seed would germinate and sprout, and soon the whole field would be green.Cheibou’s peace of mind stemmed from the trees encircling him, which had been standing long before he was born. Despite appearances, these were not any old acacias. They were gao trees – known as winterthorns in English – with unique, seemingly magical powers.From the peanut basin of Senegal to the Seno plains of Mali, to Yatenga, formerly the most degraded region of Burkina Faso, and as far south as Malawi: gaos are thriving in Africa. And over the past three decades, the landscape of southern Niger has been transformed by more than 200m new trees, many of them gaos. They have not been planted but have grown naturally on over 5m hectares of farmland, nurtured by thousands of farmers.According to scientists, what has happened in Niger – one of the world’s poorest countries – is the largest-scale positive transformation of the environment in the whole of Africa. This is not a grand UN-funded project aiming to offset climate change. Small-scale farmers have achieved it because of what the trees can do for crop yields and other aspects of farming life.“It’s a magic tree, a very wonderful tree,” said Abasse Tougiani of Niger’s National Institute of Agricultural Research, who has travelled all over Niger studying Faidherbia albida – the gao’s Latin name.Shielded from the sun, crops planted under the canopy of a tree usually do not do well in the short term, although there can be longer-term benefits. That’s one reason why many west African rainforests have been decimated. But with gaos, it’s the other way round. The root system of the gao is nearly as big as its branches, and unusually it draws nitrogen from the air, fertilising the soil. And unlike other trees in the area, gao tree leaves fall in the rainy season, allowing more sunlight through to the crops at a key moment.Used along with mineral fertilisers, crop yields double under gaos, and the gao-nourished soil holds water better, ensuring a better crop in drought years.Counterintuitively, the great gao regreening is only happening in areas of Niger with high-density populations. With less space to expand into as more people are born, hard-up farmers are increasingly realising that the trees can regenerate degraded land.“It’s literally a story of more people, more trees,” said Chris Reij, a sustainable land management specialist. “The whole point is that the trees are not protected and managed by farmers for their environmental beauty, but because they are part of the agricultural production system.”Inadvertently, the farmers are also doing their bit to offset climate change. Trees are crucial for storing carbon, absorbing it out of the atmosphere. “In mature, fairly dense areas, you get 30 tons of wood per hectare. Half of that is carbon,” said Gray Tappan, a geographer.Efforts to restore 100m hectares of degraded African land by 2030 are underway. The ambitious Great Green Wall project to surround the Sahara desert with trees and other plants has changed beyond recognition after debate over whether desertification - the process by which soil loses its fertitlity - is real. Progress is slow. In Niger, where temperatures often reach the 40s, the trees create a cooler microclimate, and rabbits and jackals are coming back.But none of these grand political projects explains why gaos have caught on. The trees’ pods make very nutritious animal fodder, and fallen branches make good firewood, meaning Droum’s women and children – whose job it is to collect fuel for cooking fires – rarely have to venture further than a few kilometres to find it.Tales about how the gao came to be so revered abound. Legend has it that crimes against gaos have been taken very seriously since the mid-19th century. “If you touched a branch, you would go to jail,” Tougiani said. In splendid brocade robes and curly-toed velvet slippers, surrounded by self-portraits and stick-wielding guards dressed in red and green, today’s district chief in Droum takes a slightly softer approach.“It’s shameful to have to come before the chief and explain yourself. Often that’s punishment enough,” Maman Ali Kaoura said. Droum’s reoffenders face fines of between 5,000 to 10,000 West African CFA francs (£6.75-£13.50), a huge amount for hard-up farmers.A sense of ownership has been key in the regreening of Niger. Until the mid-1980s, every tree was considered to belong to the state. When this changed, regreening began, as people were happier to look after trees that belonged to them. In areas with the best cover, they organised patrols to protect their trees from passing farmers and neighbouring villagers seeking firewood.Once people discovered that “one gao was equal to 10 cows” for fertilising, as Tougiani put it, the tree’s popularity took off. Several schemes, including one where farmers with more than 50 gaos were paid 50 CFA for each one, helped it along.But their loyalty to their gaos could make areas around Zinder the most vulnerable to a disease that Reij and Tougiani have recently spotted killing trees near Niamey, the capital. If it spreads, the losses could be enormous, particularly in places where there is a near-monoculture of gaos.“I’m worried, because it’s green oil for farmers – it’s their wealth,” said Tougiani. “If they lose Faidherbia albida, they’ll lose their way of life. They’ll have to leave the village.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theFor Cheibou, losing his trees is unthinkable – they were his birthright. “I have nearly 100 gao trees in my fields, which I inherited from my father,” he said.

In 10 more cases, JIAT has conceded that civilians may have been killed in error and said that compensation would be paid, but human rights advocates said there was so far no sign of any payments being made.“None of the victims’ families we reached out to said they had been contacted,” said Kristine Bekerle, a HRW researcher, noting that the cases where compensation had been promised were up to two years old. The 9 August airstrike obliterated a bus carrying schoolboys on a field trip in northern Yemen, leaving 40 children and 11 adults dead. The Saudi government told the UN security council that the strike would be investigated – but described it as “a legitimate military action”, saying it had targeted “Houthi leaders who were responsible for recruiting and training young children, and then sending them to battlefields”.The schoolboys had been on the way to a cemetery where rebels were buried but survivors told journalists that was because it was one of the very few green spaces left in the whole of the northern Saada province. Parks and gardens have been destroyed in the relentless fighting. “They came to the hospital in cars and ambulances. Dozens of children with an array of grisly wounds,” Marta Rivas Blanco, an ICRC nurse at the Al Talh hospital where the victims were taken, wrote in an account of the day for the . “Some were screaming, some were scared, many went straight to the morgue.”Statistics collated by an independent monitoring group, the Yemen Data Project, suggest that the targeting of the school bus was part of a wider pattern. According to its records, there have been 55 airstrikes against civilian vehicles and buses in the first seven months of this year – a higher rate than in 2017. The coalition, whose other principal member is the United Arab Emirates, is under little international pressure to rein in its three-year bombing campaign and its stranglehold of trade routes. The US defence secretary, James Mattis, said he had dispatched a three-star US general to Riyadh to look into the bus bombing. Meanwhile, a congressional defence spending bill signed by Donald Trump on Monday includes a clause requiring the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to certify that Saudi Arabia and the UAE are taking steps to prevent civilian deaths. Without such certification, the US would stop refuelling Saudi warplanes involved in the bombing campaign.But the attack on the school bus was not mentioned in a state department account of a subsequent phone conversation between Pompeo and the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Trump has yet to refer to it at all.In the past, the US and UK governments – the coalition’s main arms suppliers – have pointed to the establishment of JIAT as evidence of an effort to reduce civilian casualties, and maintained their weapons sales. Saudi Arabia is the biggest single buyer of arms from both countries, accounting for about half the total UK and US sales, worth billions of dollars. In May, Reuters reported that the Trump administration had asked Congress to review the sale of 120,000 Raytheon guided missiles to Saudi Arabia and UAE. Yemeni journalists posted photos and videos of fragments of what they said was a Raytheon munition from the site of the school bus bombing. The US, UK and France, the third biggest arms exporter to the Middle East, have shielded their Gulf allies from serious diplomatic pressure at the UN security council. When Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland, Peru and Bolivia called for an emergency security council meeting on Friday to discuss the school bus bombing, they received no backing from any of the five permanent members. The council did not issue a joint press statement at the end of the session, but merely “press elements”, a weaker expression of opinion, and watered down the call by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, for an “independent and prompt” investigation. The inquiry should be “credible and transparent” the council members said, leaving open the possibility that the coalition members could investigate themselves. The UK’s response to the bus attack came in the form of a tweet posted by Alistair Burt, FCO minister for the Middle East, who said he was “deeply concerned” about reports of children’s deaths, but did not mention the attack was carried out by the Saudi-led coalition. Andrew Smith of the Campaign Against Arms Trade said “the complicit silence from No 10 is a clear case of arms company profits being put above human rights and Yemeni lives.” Critics of US and UK policy argue that by continuing to arm the coalition while accepting whitewashed Saudi accounts of the civilian deaths, the two countries risk becoming legally complicit in war crimes. “When the Saudi-led coalition’s investigative process basically says they are not responsible for ninety-something percent of these airstrikes hitting civilians, it calls into question the legitimacy of that process,” said Ted Lieu, a Democratic congressman from California. This week Lieu wrote to the acting inspector general at the Pentagon calling on him to launch an investigation over whether US service members providing support for coalition air operations, or US officials selling arms to Saudi Arabia, “could be responsible for aiding and abetting war crimes”. The congressman told the : “I believe both the US and United Kingdom and other governments providing support to the Saudi-led coalition could be liable for war crimes.” Fabian Hamilton, the UK’s shadow minister for peace and disarmament, said: “As a permanent member of the UN security council, the UK government’s response to this horrific attack has been abysmal. “Failing to take action now means the government is presiding over the worst man-made humanitarian disaster of the 21st century,” Hamilton said. “Britain is currently playing a part in arming the Saudi-led coalition to the teeth, as it continues to violate international law, targeting civilians and sources of international aid.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3597315.1534368893!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"carlow hears from presidential hopefuls as gallagher considering bid","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresidential hopeful Gavin Duffy told Carlow County Council he would “inspire debate and dialogue” if elected. File photograph: Collins Two presidential candidates have indicated they would seek only one term if elected and pledged to extend Freedom of Information (FoI) to the office. Gavin Duffy and Joan Freeman said they believed one term in the office was sufficient, with Ms Freeman adding it should be reduced to five years.Mr Duffy outlined his belief that seven years was enough time to spend in one job, but then added he would make his decision on a second term known in the sixth year of his tenure.Both candidates also told Carlow County Council the office of the presidency should come under the FoI Act, with Mr Duffy committing to publishing the information regardless of whether there was legislative change.Travel, accommodation and catering costs should be published but certain correspondence and internal discussion should not be released, Mr Duffy said.This would include conversations with parties in Northern Ireland as that could result in “megaphone diplomacy”.Meanwhile, artist Kevin Sharkey indicated he would have voted for Donald Trump in the US presidential election because he has not “killed as many as the rest of them”.Mr Sharkey said he believed the media must come to terms with Mr Trump’s election and likened the US president to actor John Wayne . Mr Trump gave up “that beautiful wife” and playing golf to enter office, he added.“Trump isn’t any more likeable or unlikable than any of the other US presidents. We had Bush and his father,” Mr Sharkey said.Mr Sharkey also told the meeting it was his belief that Irish people should be prioritised in Ireland, adding Ireland needs to “wake up” to immigrationFianna Fáil councillor Arthur McDonald questioned Mr Sharkey on whether it was time for a “coloured president”.Ireland has an atheist president, a gay Taoiseach and had brought in legislation to implement orce and abortion, Mr McDonald.In response, Mr Sharkey said he did not believe his colour should form part of the discussion, adding he had experienced racism throughout his life.Four budding presidential candidates appeared before the council.Independent candidates require the support of four local authorities or 20 Oireachtas members to contest.The council is expected to make its decision next month. Sean Gallagher meanwhile is “actively considering” a second run for the office of president and will announce his intentions within a fortnight.Mr Gallagher registered a website domain name www.seangallagher2018 on Wednesday.The businessman ran in the 2011 presidential election but was defeated by President Michael D Higgins.

But it’s far from it.There is a queue of contenders who think they have what it takes to do the presidential thing. The more they expand and expound on their suitability to do the job, the more you wonder. And in some cases, the more you shake your baffled head in wonder.Four potential candidates travelled to Carlow on Wednesday to ask its county councillors to nominate them for a place on the election ticket.Two are serious contenders for a place on the ballot in October, one appears a long shot and the last hasn’t a snowball’s chance in hell.The councillors were polite and welcoming, but they didn’t seem particularly enthusiastic about any of the supplicants who passed their way in the hope of gaining preferment.At the outset, the chairman pointed out there is still time for more hopefuls to come before them and plead their case. “If I was only five years older I’d be eligible to stand as a candidate,” sighed Brian O’Donoghue (FG), “but I’m not.”Later on, one councillor mentioned that “another big name” would be declaring for the race at the weekend, but he didn’t say who this person might be.Nobody in the sweltering chamber bothered to ask.The two front-runners in this yet-to-be-completed field are businessman Gavin Duffy and Senator and mental health campaigner Joan Freeman. Both arrived with an early-day entourage in tow and each was in possession of a PR big hitter. In Duffy’s case, veteran political adviser, media consultant and field sports advocate, Liam Cahill and in Freeman’s case, author and communications consultant, Natasha Fennell.Artist Kevin Sharkey arrived on his own, armed with half a sheet of paper containing his notes. He was very glad of that sheet of paper because he was able to fan himself furiously with it as the heat levels rose.The last person to throw his hat in the ring was a grey-haired man from Galway called Patrick Feeney, who bamboozled the audience with a very convoluted description of his early years and subsequent work history, from becoming “Juvenile Connaught Boxing Champion: 6st-7” to his years in Aer Lingus via the beatification of Oliver J Plunkett and the revival of the beet industry.Among the four candidates who each believe they are eminently qualified to contest the election and win, Feeney is the only one who has ever stood before the people. He got 22 votes in the last general election, although he “always wanted to run for Galway County Council but I couldn’t get in there”.There was major disappointment midway through the afternoon when a fifth declared speaker – Marie Goretti Moylan – failed to show. “She isn’t in the house,” announced the chair, conjuring up thoughts of Elvis.On the day, it was Sharkey who gave the most arresting performance. Although it was Cllr Arthur McDonald (FF) who put the icing on the cake for him.Sharkey began his pitch by talking about growing up in Donegal. “I was the only black child there.” He then explored the question “What is racism?”. His presidency would be “a platform for opening up a conversation that we need to have as adults”.In the question-and-answer session which followed, Cllr McDonald’s query sent eyebrows shooting up and jaws dropping down.“We live in a country where we elected an atheist President. We have a gay Taoiseach. We’ve brought in orce and now we’ve brought in abortion. I just wonder,” he asked Kevin, “Do you feel that it’s time for a coloured president?”Sharkey, who was taken to task by a number of councillors about his references to Ireland being “predominately” white and needing “to have a conversation about immigration”, insisted the colour of his skin had nothing to do with his fledgling campaign.Those who challenged him and pointed to Ireland’s emigrant experience in America were told that the Irish worked hard, whereas workers coming over from Europe now are coming here “for a support system that is very attractive”.Sharkey, who twice reprimanded the media for being “lazy”, is treading what seems a familiar political path in the light of Donald Trump’s success. “Ireland should come first – that’s not to exclude anyone, that just makes common sense.”Could he get four councils to nominate him? It seems unlikely, but nothing is impossible these days. A number of councillors noted afterwards that he is a very good speaker. Indeed, he spoke fluently for 15 minutes – not always making complete sense – with only that tiny sheet of paper to guide him.And so, finally, to Gavin Duffy and Joan Freeman.Both of them shamelessly soft-soaped the Carlovians about their wonderful county and lovely people before setting out their stalls.“I believe I have the necessary experience, energy, integrity and vision to bring a new and invigorated presidency,” said Gavin, who has a “signature initiative” as his USP (unique selling point). This is his president’s international youth corps, where young people will travel Ireland and do “a tour of duty abroad” helping their fellow men and women.Sort of gap-year missionaries, without the religion.Covering all the bases, his presidency will be founded on “five pillars” of Youth, Age, Diversity and Inclusion, Respect and The Economy. Gavin wants to “just put a bit of verve into people”.All the iniduals he has dealt with over the years – from political and business leaders and people in the wider community – have one thing in common: “They have a dream of making a difference.”Not surprisingly, Joan Freeman will host a summit on mental health.She was quietly impressive, not making any big promises. She would focus on and promote issues in the way Mary McAleese spoke of building-bridges presidency and Mary Robinson looked to the dispossessed.“I am accused of being a one-trick pony” she said. “But that trick is very big.”"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Killing of dozens of children in Saudi-led coalition air strike raises stakes in desperate warBombardment of Rafah in 2014 killing 150 deemed to be for \u0026lsquoclear military purpose\u0026rsquoHarith al-Sudani spent 16 months posing as a militant jihadi, foiling dozens of attacksBomb was detonated under a police car and four security men were killed in shoot-outRiyadh defends attack as \u0026lsquolegitimate military action\u0026rsquo amid calls for independent inquiryTwelve children among those killed in the incident in the rebel-held Idlib provinceFears that many thousands of civilians could be displaced in event of devastating battleEllie Holman: \u0026lsquoThis situation has cost us . . . all of our savings, which is devastating to us\u0026rsquoIsraeli tanks fire at Hamas post after grenade reportedly thrown at its troops on the borderThe two were reportedly denied food, water and access to toilets while in custodyAttack on Thursday draws international condemnation and calls to end conflictIsraeli aircraft struck over 150 targets in Gaza on Wednesday night and ThursdayUS-backed, Saudi-led coalition hits bus in rebel-held north of war-torn countryChild among three killed in Israeli strikes in response to rocket attacks by HamasSyria\u0026rsquos first lady is reportedly being treated at a military hospital in DamascusOpposition chief Tzipi Livni apologises to Druze community for discriminatory lawTehran cuts imports of non-essential goods and introduces subsidies on food, medicineKingdom sells off Canadian assets after ambassador expelled over minister\u0026rsquos criticismAlmost two-thirds back Palestinian Authority\u0026rsquos rejection of US as mediator, poll revealsRe-imposed blanket sanctions to hit Iran\u0026rsquos access to dollars, gold and precious metals"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3598121.1534412428!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"44 small graves stir questions about us policy in yemen","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tYemeni children vent anger against Riyadh and Washington on August 13th during  a mass funeral in the northern Yemeni city of Saada  for children killed in an air strike by the Saudi-led coalition last week. Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesThe boys crammed into the bus, their thin bodies packed three to a seat, with latecomers jammed in the aisle. They fidgeted with excitement about the day’s field trip, talking so loudly that a tall boy struggling to get their attention put his hands over his ears and yelled.Hours later, most of them were dead. During a stop for snacks in the poor village of Dahyan in northern Yemen, an air strike by the Saudi-led coalition of Arab nations hit nearby, blasting the bus into a jagged mass of twisted metal and scattering its human cargo – wounded, bleeding and dead – in the street below, according to witnesses and parents.“My leg is bent,” cried a young boy covered in blood, examining his damaged limb. “A jet hit us,” he said in a video taken at the scene after the air strike. Yemeni health officials said 54 people were killed, 44 of them children, and many more were wounded.Yemen’s conflict began in 2014 when Houthi rebels, who are aligned with Iran, seized control of the capital, Sanaa, and sent the government into exile. In March 2015, Saudi Arabia – Iran’s chief rival for power and influence in the Middle East – formed a coalition of Arab nations and launched a military intervention aimed at restoring Yemen’s government. It has so far failed to do so.The August 9th attack was particularly shocking, even for a war in which children have been the primary victims, suffering through one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, with rampant malnutrition and outbreaks of cholera. The war had killed more than 10,000 people before the United Nations stopped updating the death toll two years ago.The strike also revived questions about the coalition’s tactics and the United States’s support for the campaign. American military leaders, exasperated by strikes that have killed civilians at markets, weddings and funerals, insist the United States is not a party to the war. Human rights organisations say the United States cannot deny its role, given that it has sold billions of dollars in weaponry to allied coalition states, provided them with intelligence and refuelled their bombers in mid-air.Congress has shown increasing concern about the war recently. A defence policy Bill that President Donald Trump signed on Monday included a bipartisan provision that requires secretary of state Mike Pompeo to certify that Saudi Arabia and its close ally the United Arab Emirates – the two countries leading the coalition – are taking steps to prevent civilian deaths.If Pompeo cannot provide the certification, the legislation prohibits the American refuelling of coalition jets. Pompeo raised the bus attack by phone this week with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, the kingdom’s defence minister. And defence secretary Jim Mattis dispatched a three-star general to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, to press the Saudis to investigate the bus bombing.In the wake of this attack, inidual members of Congress have gone further, calling on the military to clarify its role in air strikes on Yemen and investigate whether the support for those strikes could expose US military personnel to legal jeopardy, including for war crimes.At the same time, however, the defence contractor Raytheon has lobbied lawmakers and the US state department to allow it to sell 60,000 precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in deals worth billions of dollars.The Saudi-led coalition says it works to avoid civilian casualties and accuses its enemies, the Houthis, of using civilians as human shields. The day of the strike, the coalition’s spokesman, Col Turki al-Malki, said coalition forces had hit a “legitimate military target” after a Houthi missile killed one person and injured 11 in southern Saudi Arabia, which borders Yemen.“All of the elements that were in the bus were targeted,” Malki told the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya network, saying they included “operators and planners”. The next day, the coalition said the bombing had been referred for internal investigation after reports that “a bus was subject to collateral damage”.Human rights groups say they doubt the coalition would find itself at fault in any investigation. “The Saudis aren’t learning,” said Larry Lewis, a former state department official who visited Saudi Arabia five times in 2015 and 2016 to help the country’s air force improve its targeting procedures and investigations. “They’re making the same mistakes they’ve been making all along. And we are not pressing the issue. We are letting them get away with it.”A visit to the site of the attack, interviews with witnesses and a review of videos from the day painted a picture of the strike’s human cost. The boys on the bus ranged in age from six to about 16, and most were from Dahyan, a poor village in Saada province along the border with Saudi Arabia. The province is the homeland of the Houthis, and the coalition has bombed it heavily.For their part, the Houthis have used the area to launch attacks on the Saudi border and to fire missiles into the kingdom. The boys had been part of a religious summer programme organised by the Houthis, and the field trip was meant to be a treat.When they packed into the bus that morning, one boy, Osama al-Humran, filmed his classmates squirming in their seats with his mobile phone. Many were wearing sport coats over their Yemeni gowns, dressed up for a special occasion. The video then shows them at their next stop, a memorial and graveyard called the Garden of the Martyrs in a nearby village. In a large hangar decorated with photos of men killed in the war, a man led the boys through prayers and chants. A sign next to the door bore the Houthis slogan: “God is great. Death to America. Death to Israel. Curse the Jews. Victory for Islam.”Some of the boys giggled when Osama filmed them or put their hands over his camera. Then they ran into the adjoining graveyard, where grass grew on rows of graves marked with white headstones or plastic signs bearing photos of the deceased. “I am filming!” Osama yells as he walks among the graves.Two other boys stand next to a fountain and he calls out, “Come here so I can take your picture.” There, the video ends.The bus was supposed to continue to Saada, the provincial capital, for a visit to a historic mosque. But it never made it. The group had stopped along the way to buy juice and snacks when the bomb hit. Ali Abdullah Hamlah, a local bakery owner, said he heard the explosion and saw a huge cloud billow from the site before seeing a young man covered in blood dragging himself away. Hamlah approached and saw the bodies of seven children scattered around.“In some cases, only the upper bodies of the kids were found,” he said. The mangled body of one child was found on the roof of a building, propelled by the force of the blast. Videos shot in the aftermath show the demolished bus with the lifeless bodies of two boys on the floor. Other boys are on the ground nearby. Some struggle to move. Others are dead and eviscerated, their remains mixed up in the street with the detritus from the explosion.“It was the first time in my life that I have seen such a horrific massacre,” Hamlah said. Among the dead was Osama, the boy who had filmed his classmates. His videos were found on his phone after the bombing, according to Yahya al-Shami, who works for the Houthis’ Al-Maseera television station, which broadcast the images. Parents of boys on the bus confirmed the day’s programme and that their children were in the video.A few days later, local security officials showed the New York Times a metal fin they said had been attached to the bomb and had been found nearby. Writing on the fin indicated it was manufactured by US corporation General Dynamics and had been attached as a guidance system on a 500-pound bomb. The Times could not confirm that the fin was from the bomb used in the strike.But the remnants of US-made weapons have frequently been found in the rubble of air strikes in Yemen. Trump administration officials say they have no control over the bombs that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates buy commercially from American or other western defence contractors. Pentagon officials say they have repeatedly offered assistance to both countries on creating “no strike” lists, but they are not involved in picking targets and do not know the missions of the coalition warplanes that the United States refuels.At a nearby hospital, Abdul-Rahman al-Ejri comforted his 11-year-old son, Hassan, who was wailing from the pain of a broken leg. He had been on the bus and his father was enraged that the coalition had said it carried military plotters.“This is the mastermind, along with his companions,” Ejri said sarcastically. “How can they plot anything? They’re kids and only armed with pens, notebooks and books.”He did not hesitate to assign blame. “America is the head of evil, as well as the Saudi regime and the mercenaries of the Saudi regime,” he said. – New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

They give money in exchange for votes, and people accept it out of greed. And then they leave.”“Our people don’t realise the importance of their vote – they sell themselves. The people of Thar do not have roads, water to drink, hospitals, schools – the basic necessities of life.”Analysis | Post-election, Imran Khan faces his toughest battle yetPakistan\u0027s minorities have this year seen the first election of a female, scheduled caste Hindu senator, Krishna Kumari Kohli. At the time of her election she vowed to work for the “empowerment of women, their health, and education”.Pakistan\u0027s assembly has 70 seats reserved for minorities and women, but the general election also saw the first election of a Hindu politician to a general seat, Mahesh Kumar Malan.Seema Maheshwari, a human rights activist in Sindh, said the fact many of the 10 minority women had stood for general seats as independents in the rural parts of the province or in the port of Karachi was a “sea change”.She said it was sign of growing confidence among women. She said: “We can see that not only male persons, but also female persons can stand. Women think they are adults, they are citizens, they are also human beings.”Basic healthcare, clean water and education were often the core of their election demands.The Thar desert in Sindh province is one of the most deprived parts of the country and its residents are largely Hindu..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}When I talk to people, I sense their frustration. The biggest issue is the lack of clean drinking waterSunita Parmar MenghwarMrs Parmar, a university graduate from the local city of Mithi, said: “In particular, I would like to open a hospital that has a gynecology department, with all the equipment and tools for delivery, so women don’t have to travel far. The way it is in other places. Many women die during child birth.“When I go out campaigning, I notice that there are hospitals – but no doctors. There are schools – but no teachers. When I talk to people, I sense their frustration. The biggest issue is the lack of clean drinking water.”Another minority candidate, a Christian woman called Nomi Bashir, had similar complaints in Karachi.“There is no water, we don’t have proper roads and our education system is completely flawed,” she said in a newspaper interview while on the campaign trail.The rough-and-tumble of Pakistan\u0027s politics can be tough for candidates without money or powerful support.Mrs Parmar said she had been intimidated and told to back down.“Yes, there have been instances where I’ve gotten calls telling me to step aside. These feudals that rule over us have tried to pressure me. They’d call at my house and say, \u0027Tell Sunita to step aside\u0027. But I have stepped forward for my community and I will not back down. I’m not alone, I have the entire downtrodden class with me.”On the July 25 polling day she picked up 352 votes. The winner, Fakir Sher Mohammad of the Pakistan People\u0027s Party, picked up nearly 55,000.Perhaps it was fear that stopped her neighbours voting for her, or perhaps they were paid off, she said.I thought more people would vote, I thought I would win,” she told the .“But I still feel happy. I don’t care about win or loss, I’m happy I competed.

They\u0027re going to drink in the aircraft, he said. He warned that the plans could also hit sales of premium whisky as US tourists returning home on early morning flights would be prevented from buying the spirit as a gift or souvenir.He said the issue should instead be tackled by giving passengers warnings about the consequences if they were drunk on board and airlines intervening to speak to high-risk groups such as stag and hen parties.The Home Office is due to launch a consultation on extending the Licensing Act after a House of Lords select committee recommended that the exemption be removed. A spokeswoman for the IAS said that arguments from all parties were awarded the same consideration without preferential treatment for any one stakeholder group..html-embedponent

of three vets, a nurse, three dermatologists and five more park staff were on hand when 97.6 stone (620kg) Victor needed to be given an allergy test.The major operation was put in place after Victor and his smaller friend, Nobby, began suffering from abscesses on their feet.Staff suspected it was caused by an allergic reaction to pollen after moving from concrete bear pit enclosures elsewhere to the more natural setting at the attraction near Doncaster.Victor, a 620 kg polar bear, is given an allergy test at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park near Doncaster after he and a smaller bear, Nobby, began suffering from abscesses on their feetSuch was the bear\u0027s bulk, Press Association photographer Danny Lawson was also asked to put down his camera and help manoeuvre Victor into a comfortable position after he had been anaesthetised.Dermatologists from Liverpool University were brought in to carry out tests on Victor\u0027s skin, once he had safely been put under, to verify the theory.The results will be known in the coming days.Victor was shaved and there are about 50 test sites on his side.Fingers crossed we can find out which allergies he has and we can set about making life more comfortable for him.A team of three vets, a nurse, three dermatologists and five more park staff were on hand to carry out tests while the bear was under sedation.Ms Porter said it was often the case that bears which had previously been in sterile, frequently disinfected enclosures developed pollen allergies when they were moved to more natural quarters.Antibiotics have previously helped - while antihistamines have not - but Ms Porter said finding the right serum for Victor and fellow sufferer Nobby was the best idea long term.And he seemed none the worse for the experience on Wednesday, with Ms Porter saying: He\u0027s come around nicely, he\u0027s very calm and seems settled.Queen\u0026#39s physician, Dr Peter Fisher, killed in crash with lorry while cycling in central

street names in recent monthsClick to followThe Independent OnlineTwo thirds of UK shoppers expect high street prices to surge because of BrexitBritish shoppers are expecting price hikes and store closures on the high street as a result of Brexit, according to new research from think tank Parliament Street. More than two thirds (64 per cent) of consumers are expecting prices to rise due to the UK leaving the European Union, with 24 per cent preparing for a “substantial” increase, according to a poll of 1,000 shoppers carried out by Censuswide. Meanwhile, more than half (54 per cent) expect to see more stores closing down in future. Hundreds of high street shop closures have been announced in recent months, with Marks \u0026amp Spencer, Mothercare and House of Fraser all setting out plans to downsize.Earlier this week, Homebase confirmed it will shut 42 branches across the UK and Ireland in a bid to cut its cost base. The issue of costs is one of the main problems retailers are facing, Parliament Street said in its Retail Revolution report. “Long-term leases are costly and preventing stores from downsizing or moving to cheaper rental properties,” the study said. “One of the newer aspects we are seeing is that retail centres and high streets are investing in pop-up spaces to try out new areas to drive\u0026nbspprofits.”The think tank also noted the launch of the Amazon Go store was a sign the online giant was “beginning to change the traditional high street model”.“The traditional high street model is at risk of being forgotten with online retailers trying their luck at moving into the physical store after making a name for themselves online first,” the report said. Parliament Street said retailers should invest in technology to save money, as a customer experience “replicated through mobile apps, sites and physically in-store will attract and retain\u0026nbspcustomer loyalty”, and also recommended that brands improve personalisation for shoppers. Mike Ashley: from Sports Direct to ‘Harrod’s of the High Street’Poundworld to vanish from the high street as shop closures announcedGovernment urged to slash business rates to save UK high streetsThis was reflected in findings from Salesforce this week that showed 64 per cent of shoppers feel that retailers “don’t know them”.Michael Ni at personalised shopping specialist RichRelevance said Parliament Street’s findings highlighted a need for retailers to avoid complacency and make sure they are investing to keep customers loyal to their brand. “Already this year we have seen several high street chains collapse into administration, many of which have fallen behind in the race to deliver personalised digital experiences to customers online,” he said. “Whilst it’s clear that the majority expect store closures to continue next year, these changes do not have to mean the end for major high street outlets.“Investing in mobile apps, voice assistants and fingerprint scanning can help shake up customer experiences both in-store and online, giving struggling brands a much needed boost despite the potential turbulence of Brexit.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your

goods on Instagram, Snapchat and other social media platforms are being probed by the competition regulator over concerns that paid advertisements are not being properly declared.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched an investigation on Tuesday into the labelling of online endorsements.Some celebrities and influencers have a considerable amount of commercial power thanks to millions of followers who watch their channels to see where they go on holiday, what they wear, which products they use, the books they read and more.This makes online endorsements from celebrities and influencers valuable to brands trying to reach target audiences and boost sales.But the watchdog fears some influencers are flouting consumer protection law which requires that any reward received for an endorsement, is made clear.If celebrities do not label their posts properly, fans or followers may be led to believe that an endorsement represents the star’s own view, rather than a paid-for promotion, the CMA\u0026nbspsaid.They are then more likely to place trust in that product than they would otherwise have been, the watchdog said, as they think it has been recommended by someone they admire.The five biggest fashion influencers from this year’s Love IslandThis LA mural is reserved for social media influencersLuxury hotel overwhelmed by influencers asking for free roomsFitness

cosmetics, a car, or a holiday being plugged by someone they admire, they might be swayed into buying it.So, it’s really important they are clearly told whether a celebrity is promoting a product because they have bought it themselves, or because they have been paid or thanked in some way by the brand.The\u0026nbspCMA\u0026nbsphas written to a range of celebrities and social media influencers

Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/16/south-africa-school.jpg","title":"south africa corruption president ramaphosa mabuza zuma anc","story":"Created with Sketch.The ruling African National Congress pledges education and opportunity\u0026nbspfor black people\u0026nbsp– but embezzlement in the\u0026nbspdeputy president’s province has left schools so decrepit that children plunge to their death in toiletsClick to followThe Independent OnlineSchool at Orange Farm, near Soweto: one of the ANC’s policies is to improve education for black South African childrenZiyanda\u0026nbspNkosi hated going to the bathroom at school. The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the little girl, a six-year-old first-grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.“Mommy! Mommy!” she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former maths teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress (ANC) and was positioning himself to become South Africa’s deputy president.One of the party’s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. ANC leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school\u0026nbspand Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the ANC the education system has been a\u0026nbspshambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda’s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local ANC leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents –\u0026nbspand for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the ANC tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire ANC, launching him into an even more prominent post\u0026nbspas South Africa’s deputy president, second only to the nation’s leader.Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the ANC is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mandela’s legacy. After all, Mabuza’s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country’s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mabuza’s spectacular climb, current and former ANC officials say: he siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.Mabuza (second right) (AFPGetty)“He didn’t become what he is now because of his political capability,” says\u0026nbspFish Mahlalela, a senior ANC figure in the province and a national lawmaker.“No, no, it was out of money and\u0026nbspmanipulation,” he adds. “Nothing else.”Perhaps more than any other member of South Africa’s new government, Mabuza undercuts the promise of a “new dawn” in the country after the removal of President Jacob Zuma this year.Besieged by scandals that have hacked away at the ANC’s legitimacy and electoral prospects, the party installed a new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in February. From the start, he pledged to root out corruption and finally deliver on the promise of a just South Africa for all of its citizens.But to seal his new post, Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa’s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country’s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the “tragedies that take away the innocence of our children”. He spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a five-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of faeces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolising the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.“Where is our care?” Mabuza said in the speech. “What has gone wrong with our nation?”Yet under Mabuza’s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required\u0026nbspand school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mabuza’s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to ANC officials, high-ranking defectors and anti-corruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled\u0026nbspfor unexplained reasons\u0026nbspto $30m (£23m) each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mabuza’s province also became known as one of South Africa’s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the ANC, were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while\u0026nbspMabuza’s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new ANC members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the ANC’s second biggest voting bloc. Under the party’s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria\u0026nbspwith a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mabuza’s role as the country’s second most powerful politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its assertions that the ANC is turning the page on corruption.Under the ANC, Mandela’s once-heralded liberation movement, tens of billions of dollars meant to lift poor black South Africans have been stolen by party leaders. Strong institutions like the tax agency have been hollowed out by party officials bent on shielding their illicit activities.But the nation’s poor schools are perhaps the ANC’s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans – some of whom have turned to burning down such institutions in protest.Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Ramaphosa’s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: the new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration’s future – as well as the country’s – rests in the hands of Mabuza.“If there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa’s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,” says\u0026nbspRalph Mathekga, the author of Ramaphosa’s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?“We are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,” he adds. “If Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.”Scandal from the startThe numbers just didn’t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mabuza got his first big break: he became Mpumalanga’s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect resume. The son of farmers, Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalls\u0026nbspReginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.“He was never late,” says\u0026nbspMhaule, a longtime ally who recently became one of South Africa’s two deputy foreign ministers.A bright student, Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught maths at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers’ association.Poor schooling was a major spark in the anti-apartheid movement, most notably in Soweto in 1976, when thousands of students protested the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Mabuza’s province, teachers and students began organising against white minority rule in the early 1980s.The teachers were at the centre\u0026nbspof the movement, says\u0026nbspSandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mabuza into the main student organisation. Mabuza quickly stood out, he says, travelling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)“He was a leader in his own right,” Sukati says.But after apartheid ended, Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province’s first big scandal of the democratic era.\u0026nbspIn 1997, three years into his tenure as education minister, the schools were performing poorly, especially on the national obsession: the annual matriculation exams that determine whether students graduate from high school. The passing rate in his province was 46 per cent that year, slightly below the national average.Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful ANC leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former ANC officials say.Sukati, who worked under Mabuza at the education department, recalls Mabuza\u0026nbsptelling some of the teachers: “I am in a tight situation.”\u0026nbspThe next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 per cent – an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to second place\u0026nbspamong the nation’s nine provinces.“I was suspicious,” says\u0026nbspSukati, who is now a senior education official. “It couldn’t just happen like that.”A whistleblower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, authorities announced, was under 53 per cent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mabuza’s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired.An investigation was never completed. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mabuza’s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the ANC across South Africa..“I think\u0026nbspthe man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don’t know what went wrong,” says\u0026nbspRonnie Malomane, an ANC official who was taught maths by Mabuza in the early 1980s. “They were just giving him position after position.”Nationally, Mabuza’s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move – called the “Rapid Implementation Unit” – as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.“That’s how he managed to loot,” says\u0026nbspCollen Sedibe, a former ANC leader who grew up on the same street as Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures “incurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier”.But parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.‘They wanted to kill me’It took four days of rage before the local ANC councillor showed up.The councillor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: he is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.By the time he got to Ziyanda’s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the ANC’s leaders.Siboza made sure to bring a gun. Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he says.The ANC has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the ANC as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several ANC officials say, Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the ANC ensures its dominance.But Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mabuza, rejects\u0026nbspany suggestion that the ANC had failed to prioritise education.Officials like Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Siboza, the local ANC councillor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.“They wanted to kill me,” the councillor says.Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun – firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. “This man is a church member,” he says.A few days later, the ANC councillor visited the children he had wounded.“The councillor said he was very sorry,” says\u0026nbspthe girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councillor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she says. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy’s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councillor, about $150.The boy’s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplores\u0026nbspthe state of education.“They promise,” she says, “and they just disappear.”Still, she would remain loyal to the governing party.“Yes, of course, I vote ANC,” she says. “It’s our freedom.”‘He always had money in his house’The protests spilled into September, but the country’s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Zuma as South Africa’s president.The all-important ANC party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mabuza’s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the ANC released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mabuza: his previously low-ranking province was now the ANC’s second most powerful.Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, ANC membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 per cent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 per cent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga’s explosive growth.But Mabuza’s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former ANC officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money – with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that “irregular expenditures” more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, ANC officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students’ expense.Thousands in Israel protest draft law that would ‘exclude’ ArabsGrenfell victims were subject to ‘social apartheid’, says Diane AbbottSouth Africa is the most unequal country in the world, says World BankMandela’s letters chart his heartbreaking struggle from behind barsAs premier, Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega-schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11m to around $30m.Asked whether Mabuza wanted the mega-schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Mhaule, his former education minister, laughs\u0026nbspand says:\u0026nbsp“I don’t know.”But other officials say the mega-schools were overpriced projects to reward Mabuza’s allies and finance his ANC membership drive.Mabuza\u0026nbspwas sworn in as deputy president in February. “His passion,” reads his official biography, “still remains in education.”Minutes after the swearing-in, he faced questions about corruption and political killings in his province. “There’s nothing to set straight,” he told the national public broadcaster.“I’m here to serve South Africans,” he added. “Let’s give this government a chance.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click

Exclusive trailer for new western hailed best indie of the yearFestival favourite The Rider is finally galloping its way into UK cinemas this September, and we\u0027re happy to exclusively unveil the first trailer.Directed by Chloé Zhao, the acclaimed drama – which won the top prize at this year\u0027s Cannes Director’s Fortnight – follows a young rodeo cowboy who must come to terms with never riding again after surviving a near-fatal accident.Setting this independent film apart is its cast – real-life Lakota cowboy Brady Jandreau was handed the lead role alongside an ensemble comprised of his family and friends, a decision which\u0026nbspresults in what looks to be a naturalistic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota.Filmmaker\u0026nbspZhao, in particular, has been praised in particular for crafting a film that offers a female perspective on masculinity – a rarity in cinema today.The Rider, which received its premiere at festivals including Telluride and Sundance, swiftly rose to the top of many critics \u0027Best of...\u0027 lists despite its US release in April which has only served to heighten anticipation in the UK.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSpeaking about his role in the film, Jandreau told KSFY: “I was proud to portray my part of the world. Hope I did a good portrayal of it. It leaves a lot of room. You don\u0027t necessarily have to be Native American, cowboy or South Dakotan to appreciate the film. It leaves enough room for everyone to take home what they need.”25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonZhao\u0027s previous film was drama\u0026nbspSongs My Brother Taught Me (2015) – also set in South Dakota – which was produced by Forest Whitaker.The Rider is released in the UK on SeptemberEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/13/18/brexit.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1615  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/13/18/brexit.jpg","title":"brexit referendum no deal conservative party foreign office minister alistair burt","story":"Created with Sketch.The survey of constituents led to some anger from Brexit backing Tory MPSClick to followIndy PoliticsMinister Alistair Burt has now taken down the survey from his websiteA senior Conservative minister ran a survey on his website asking constituents whether they want a new referendum on Brexit.Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt asked both if people backed a fresh referendum and what options should be covered on the ballot paper.He was later forced to clarify that he was not supporting another public vote on Brexit, which would constitute a major break from Theresa May’s official stance, but was merely using the survey to discover what voters in his constituency thought.It comes as polls show fast increasing support for a new referendum, amid deepening Tory isions over withdrawal, doubts that Ms May can secure parliamentary backing for her plans and meagre public support for her approach.The Independent has launched its own campaign for a new referendum which would give the British public the Final Say on whatever Brexit outcome emerges.After asking constituents in the survey whether they backed a “further vote”, Mr Burt, an advocate of Remain in 2016, asked which options should be on the ballot paper of a new referendum including, a vote on the final deal, a re-run of the original or a three-way vote – soft Brexit, hard Brexit or remaining in.He later said: “I don’t support a second referendum as any constituents who have written to me about it know.“But how am I to know who thinks what unless I ask?”Ms May has been adamant that there will not be a further referendum on Brexit, despite the growing tide of opinion in favour of one, meaning ministers wanting to publically back one would likely have to resign their posts.British expats in the EU launch High Court bid to overturn Brexit50:50 chance of a no-deal Brexit, says Latvian foreign ministerA no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for cities like LiverpoolBrexiteers drawing up plan ‘to rival May’s Chequers proposal’More than 100 constituencies which backed Brexit now back RemainFirms face Brexit skills shortage, forcing up wages in some sectorsIn a further statement on his website, Mr Burt said the survey had now been taken down, highlighted his previous opposition to a new referendum, said there is “no going back” on the first referendum and underlined that he is fully behind the prime minister’s efforts to find a Brexit deal.But the move still provoked some anger from Brexit-backing MPs, with one telling The Independent he was not convinced by Mr Burt’s explanation that he was merely canvassing public opinion.North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen said: “I’m a bit puzzled because as a member of the government he is bound by collective responsibility.“I wasn’t aware it was government policy to canvass people on another referendum, especially as we haven’t fulfilled the will of the people on the first referendum yet.”Rees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011If he did back a new vote on Brexit, Mr Burt would not be the first senior Conservative to do so, with ex-cabinet ministers Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve both having written for The Independent in support of one.The Final Say campaign petition now has some 615,000 signatures after being launched just three weeks ago.An exclusive poll carried out by BMG Research this week found that 48 per cent of the public would now back a vote on any deal struck between the UK and the EU – up from 44 per cent just four weeks ago.Just 24 per cent opposed the idea, down three points over the same period.

Around two-thirds of Scots think the UK is ignoring their concerns and don’t trust Westminster to take the decisions.”He continued: “But the survey suggests the leaderships of both the SNP and the Labour Party are in the wrong place with most of their supporters. There may be an electoral idend in Scotland for one of these parties if they strengthen their position.“For instance, by a margin of three to one Labour supporters want Jeremy Corbyn to campaign for a public vote, while Nicola Sturgeon may yet want to move faster than she has in backing such a route on Brexit.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/11/09/06/ilhan-omar-1.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/11/09/06/ilhan-omar-1.jpg","title":"ilhan omar wins minnesota democratic primary victory speech watch","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027In my last race, I talked about what my win would have meant for that eight-year-old girl in that refugee camp,\u0027 she tells crowdClick to followThe Independent USIlhan Omar, who is likely to become the first Somali-American elected to US Congress, made history on Tuesday by winning a seat in Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District.The politician garnered national attention just two years ago after becoming the first Somali American elected to a state legislature in Minnesota - unseating a 22-term Democratic incumbent.In my last race, I talked about what my win would have meant for that eight-year-old girl in that refugee camp,” she told a crowd of supporters after her win.\u0026nbspJahana Hayes could be Connecticut\u0027s first black Democrat in CongressTransgender candidate Christine Hallquist makes history in VermontAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez supports Kaniela Ing in Hawaii primaries“And today, today, I still think about her and I think about the kind of hope and optimism all of those eight-year-olds around the country and around the world get from seeing your beautiful faces elect and believe in someone like me.“So I humbly thank you.

It is unclear whether the North Korean leader responded.When Mr Peskov was asked whether the two leaders could meet in Vlaostok, he said the economic forum is\u0026nbsp”open for all the leaders of the region” but said Moscow has “so far” received no confirmation\u0026nbspfrom Pyongyang to indicate Mr Kim\u0026nbspwill attend.Mr Kim also sent a message to Mr Putin, KCNA reported, noting the “valuable tradition” as they “struggled shoulder to shoulder against the common enemy in the arduous anti-Japanese war”, which it said provided the “strong roots” for their diplomatic relations.It was unclear if the message came before or after Mr Putin’s invitation.It comes as North Korea marked its liberation from Japanese rule\u0026nbspwith relatively low-key celebrations.A group of war veterans from the former Soviet Union participated and thousands of people cheered their football team to victory over a South Korean squad in the opening match of an under-15 youth tournament in Pyongyang, which featured players from several countries.People also streamed to statues of the country’s leaders or other monuments to observe the anniversary, as is customary.Escape from North KoreaA hat belonging to Jeong Min-woo in Seoul. Min-woo is from Hyesan, on the border with China. He was a commissioned officer in the Korean People\u0027s Army, and left in his uniform. South Korean intelligence confiscated it, but he persuaded his North Korean military contacts to send him a new one.Jeong Min-woo, 29, poses for a photograph in SeoulKang, 28, who wanted to be identified only by her surname, poses for a photograph in Seoul. The parents of Kang sent out a coat across the Chinese border after she reached the South in 2010. I didn\u0027t ask my mother to send me this coat, said Kang. But she knew I feel the cold easily and sent it to me. She sent some honey too, but it went missing on the way. The coat is made of dog fur. I don\u0027t know what kind of dog. In 2010, it cost about 700,000 North Korean won ($88 at the unofficial rate). It was really expensive. A North Korean friend went to China to pick it up for me. I liked this coat when I got it. I thought my mother must\u0027ve spent quite a lot of money on it.  The dog fur coat belonging to Kang, My father was a party officer. Our family had a car and we lived in a special apartment. Ordinary people couldn\u0027t afford to wear this kind of coat, not even soldiers. Commissioned officers could afford them. Border guards would wear them. It wasn\u0027t easy to buy this kind of coat, but as time went on, fake ones began to appear. The state often clamped down on this item. It\u0027s technically military supplies so the state monitored people who altered the design of the coat. I know just from looking at this coat that it\u0027s a counterfeit one, not the official version. The counterfeit ones look quite different from the original ones. Military officials preferred the fakes to the original because the design looked much better. The children of rich families would wear them. I look too chubby in this, so don\u0027t wear it here. I thought I could probably wear it if I altered it.Lee Oui-ryuk is from Onsong, near the border with China. He defected in 2010, and brought his ID card with him. I brought my ID with me when I left North Korea. Juche 95.11.7 (the date in the North Korean calendar, which equates to Nov. 7, 2006) is the date I was issued with my ID. It says here my blood type is A, but I\u0027m actually an O. For the 23 years I lived in North Korea, I thought my blood type was A. They wrote down my blood type without even doing a test. They just wrote whatever they wanted to. I was caught trying to defect to South Korea around Kim Jong Il\u0027s birthday. They strengthen border security just before and after that date.The bottom of the lamp is dark, as the saying goes, and I thought I\u0027d be able to cross right under their noses. The soldiers shot at me as I tried to run away from the Tumen River. I managed to get away and hid, but someone reported me and I was caught. That\u0027s when I was taken to the bowibu (North Korean secret police) for three months of interrogation. The state ruled that I had tried to defect to South Korea, and I was sent to a camp for political prisoners. I escaped when they were transferring me to the camp. I hid and managed to make it to my big sister\u0027s house - that\u0027s when I grabbed these photos. I couldn\u0027t go home easily, so decided I had to hide in the mountains or somewhere remote. I needed my ID to move around without getting caught. and I took these 12 photos with me in case I wanted to look back and reminisce. I wrote on the back of them so as not to forget.Ji Sung-ho, 35, from Hoeryong, near the border with China. He left North Korea in 2006 with a pair of wooden crutches. I lived as a child beggar in North Korea. I was stealing coals from a train when I fell off and lost my leg and my hand. I had to bring the crutches with me. If I didn\u0027t have them, I wouldn\u0027t have made it here. The state doesn\u0027t help you in North Korea, and people who need crutches make their own. Mine are therefore not factory-made, so they\u0027re not perfect and break easily. I had several pairs of crutches but they all broke, and this was the last pair. I used these crutches for 10 years, until I was 25, when I arrived in South Korea. I would steal coal from moving trains and fall off, destroying my crutches. Or I would get beaten up by the police and they\u0027d take and then break my crutches. When they broke, I would make new ones. When I had new ones, I could go back outside.When I first arrived in South Korea I thought about throwing them out. South Korea\u0027s intelligence agency gave me a prosthetic leg. My friends said I should throw the crutches out and not think about North Korea. They said I should show Kim Jong Il I was living a new life in South Korea and throw out everything I had from the North. Some asked if I got upset when I saw my crutches. But I couldn\u0027t just throw them out. To make my crutches, my friends had given me some wood that they had bought, and someone I knew in North Korea who had carpentry skills had made them. It was my father who added the final touches. There is a lot of love from my North Korean friends and family in these crutches. So I didn\u0027t throw them out. The South Korean government gave me some new crutches because the wood from my North Korean ones is hard and painful. But I still keep them, so as not to forget those memories. Kim Ryen Hui, 48, is from Pyongyang. She says she never wanted to defect. In 2011, she says, a broker helped her go to China for treatment on her liver. But the broker tricked her, she said, and she ended up in South Korea. She is campaigning to return, which Seoul says would be against the law. I miss my parents even more than I miss my daughter. They\u0027re everything to me. For the first few years, I couldn\u0027t even breathe properly when I thought of them. My little brother lives with them in Pyongyang now. My mother can\u0027t see out of one eye. The thing I fear the most is finding out they\u0027ve passed away before I have the chance to go back. My daughter and I have been writing letters and sending photos to each other. My cousin lives in China, so she\u0027s been sending them on. My daughter\u0027s name is Ri Ryon Gum. She was born on February 15, 1993. I don\u0027t want her to live out her life with me here. When she was young, she did taekwondo. She wanted to get involved in espionage operations against South Korea. She was so fearless. That\u0027s why she was doing taekwondo - to get involved in anti-South espionage. So I was really surprised to hear she became a chef. In a video of her I received, she explained why. She said that after I had left, she moved in with her father in Pyongyang and had been cooking for him. She said she decided to become a chef so she could fulfill my role at home. I was sad when I heard that.Lee Min-bok, 60, was a researcher at North Korea\u0027s Academy of Agricultural Science. He first tried to defect, unsuccessfully, in 1990. He eventually left North Korea in June 1991 and came to South Korea in 1995. His family sent him these diaries. I have a bit of an academic side. According to Kim Il Sung\u0027s teachings, people are supposed to keep diaries. Everyone in North Korea should strictly follow Kim Il Sung\u0027s teachings, so I did as I was supposed to and kept a diary. Even though Kim Il Sung is a villain here, in North Korea he\u0027s above everything. We learned that he studied well and gave our lives purpose. I lived according to those teachings. I wrote these out of loyalty to the Leader. That was our ideology, and I lived my life in strict adherence to it. No one could think differently.I got hold of these diaries 10 years after I arrived in South Korea. I had been sending money to my family in the North and they sent them to me. I didn\u0027t write any complaints in diaries. I would\u0027ve been in big trouble if I did. My diaries are a record of my history in North Korea. I am thinking about turning these diaries into a book. I\u0027d like to publish a book about how to change North Koreans\u0027 thinking when unification happens. These diaries show how North Koreans think and how their minds are constructed. People need to make these into a textbook, because they need proof. Talking is not as effective.Song Byeok was a propaganda artist. His father drowned trying to cross the Tumen river, in 2000. When the artist finally left North Korea in 2001, he brought photos of his family with him. We left that August to find food, Byeok recalled, describing the first attempt. We were from a town further inland, and we weren\u0027t sure where the river was high and where it was low. I didn\u0027t know at the time but the river was swollen because of the rainy season. I thought we had to cross it anyway. All I could think about was getting to China to buy food. I took off my clothes and tied them into a rope to strap us together. I told my father not to let go. As we approached the middle of the river, the strap felt lighter. I looked back and saw my father drifting away. I was devastated.He was going under the water and couldn\u0027t get out. I rushed up to the (North Korean) border guards and asked them to save him but they just said why did I come out, why didn\u0027t I die too. They handcuffed me and took me away. It was Aug. 28. I was tortured by the bowibu (North Korean secret police) in Hoeryong, then jailed for four months in Chongjin prison camp. But after I was released from the camp I felt like I needed to survive and carry on living. Right before I tried to defect again, I went back home and grabbed my family photos. Even if I died trying, I thought, at least I would have this picture with me. I never found my father. After I came to South Korea, I went back to China in 2004 and held a memorial service for him by the river. My heart still aches.Baek Hwa-sung, 33, left Sinuiju, on the border with China, in 2003 and resettled in South Korea in 2008. He kept a diary as he defected. In 2004, I started to write down all my thoughts in a diary. I didn\u0027t know if I\u0027d get caught. I just wanted to let it be known where I was from, and where I wanted to go. After I left the North, I became very depressed, hiding in the mountains alone for a while. The people who were watching over me told me not to come down to the village and left me by myself in a mountain shelter. Alone, with no one to engage with or talk to, I felt like I would go insane. So I wanted to leave something behind in case I died there or got caught - that\u0027s why I started to write.Alone in the mountains, I desperately sought something to talk to. That was my diary. My diaries are proof of my life\u0027s journey. I read them when I want to remember home. I can\u0027t return home, and I already have no memories of my hometown. But when I go through my diaries, there are notes which detail the vivid memories of that time. Sometimes I might forget my father\u0027s birthday, but when I go back to my diary, his birthday and my mother\u0027s birthday are there. My diaries are a record of my life. They prove I\u0027m alive.A hat belonging to Jeong Min-woo in Seoul. Min-woo is from Hyesan, on the border with China.

I wrote on the back of them so as not to forget.Ji Sung-ho, 35, from Hoeryong, near the border with China. He left North Korea in 2006 with a pair of wooden crutches. I lived as a child beggar in North Korea. I was stealing coals from a train when I fell off and lost my leg and my hand. I had to bring the crutches with me. If I didn\u0027t have them, I wouldn\u0027t have made it here. The state doesn\u0027t help you in North Korea, and people who need crutches make their own. Mine are therefore not factory-made, so they\u0027re not perfect and break easily. I had several pairs of crutches but they all broke, and this was the last pair. I used these crutches for 10 years, until I was 25, when I arrived in South Korea. I would steal coal from moving trains and fall off, destroying my crutches. Or I would get beaten up by the police and they\u0027d take and then break my crutches. When they broke, I would make new ones. When I had new ones, I could go back outside.When I first arrived in South Korea I thought about throwing them out. South Korea\u0027s intelligence agency gave me a prosthetic leg. My friends said I should throw the crutches out and not think about North Korea. They said I should show Kim Jong Il I was living a new life in South Korea and throw out everything I had from the North. Some asked if I got upset when I saw my crutches. But I couldn\u0027t just throw them out. To make my crutches, my friends had given me some wood that they had bought, and someone I knew in North Korea who had carpentry skills had made them. It was my father who added the final touches. There is a lot of love from my North Korean friends and family in these crutches. So I didn\u0027t throw them out. The South Korean government gave me some new crutches because the wood from my North Korean ones is hard and painful. But I still keep them, so as not to forget those memories. Kim Ryen Hui, 48, is from Pyongyang. She says she never wanted to defect. In 2011, she says, a broker helped her go to China for treatment on her liver. But the broker tricked her, she said, and she ended up in South Korea. She is campaigning to return, which Seoul says would be against the law. I miss my parents even more than I miss my daughter. They\u0027re everything to me. For the first few years, I couldn\u0027t even breathe properly when I thought of them. My little brother lives with them in Pyongyang now. My mother can\u0027t see out of one eye. The thing I fear the most is finding out they\u0027ve passed away before I have the chance to go back. My daughter and I have been writing letters and sending photos to each other. My cousin lives in China, so she\u0027s been sending them on. My daughter\u0027s name is Ri Ryon Gum. She was born on February 15, 1993. I don\u0027t want her to live out her life with me here. When she was young, she did taekwondo. She wanted to get involved in espionage operations against South Korea. She was so fearless. That\u0027s why she was doing taekwondo - to get involved in anti-South espionage. So I was really surprised to hear she became a chef. In a video of her I received, she explained why. She said that after I had left, she moved in with her father in Pyongyang and had been cooking for him. She said she decided to become a chef so she could fulfill my role at home. I was sad when I heard that.Lee Min-bok, 60, was a researcher at North Korea\u0027s Academy of Agricultural Science. He first tried to defect, unsuccessfully, in 1990. He eventually left North Korea in June 1991 and came to South Korea in 1995. His family sent him these diaries. I have a bit of an academic side. According to Kim Il Sung\u0027s teachings, people are supposed to keep diaries. Everyone in North Korea should strictly follow Kim Il Sung\u0027s teachings, so I did as I was supposed to and kept a diary. Even though Kim Il Sung is a villain here, in North Korea he\u0027s above everything. We learned that he studied well and gave our lives purpose. I lived according to those teachings. I wrote these out of loyalty to the Leader. That was our ideology, and I lived my life in strict adherence to it. No one could think differently.I got hold of these diaries 10 years after I arrived in South Korea. I had been sending money to my family in the North and they sent them to me. I didn\u0027t write any complaints in diaries. I would\u0027ve been in big trouble if I did. My diaries are a record of my history in North Korea. I am thinking about turning these diaries into a book. I\u0027d like to publish a book about how to change North Koreans\u0027 thinking when unification happens. These diaries show how North Koreans think and how their minds are constructed. People need to make these into a textbook, because they need proof. Talking is not as effective.Song Byeok was a propaganda artist. His father drowned trying to cross the Tumen river, in 2000. When the artist finally left North Korea in 2001, he brought photos of his family with him. We left that August to find food, Byeok recalled, describing the first attempt. We were from a town further inland, and we weren\u0027t sure where the river was high and where it was low. I didn\u0027t know at the time but the river was swollen because of the rainy season. I thought we had to cross it anyway. All I could think about was getting to China to buy food. I took off my clothes and tied them into a rope to strap us together. I told my father not to let go. As we approached the middle of the river, the strap felt lighter. I looked back and saw my father drifting away. I was devastated.He was going under the water and couldn\u0027t get out. I rushed up to the (North Korean) border guards and asked them to save him but they just said why did I come out, why didn\u0027t I die too. They handcuffed me and took me away. It was Aug. 28. I was tortured by the bowibu (North Korean secret police) in Hoeryong, then jailed for four months in Chongjin prison camp. But after I was released from the camp I felt like I needed to survive and carry on living. Right before I tried to defect again, I went back home and grabbed my family photos. Even if I died trying, I thought, at least I would have this picture with me. I never found my father. After I came to South Korea, I went back to China in 2004 and held a memorial service for him by the river. My heart still aches.Baek Hwa-sung, 33, left Sinuiju, on the border with China, in 2003 and resettled in South Korea in 2008. He kept a diary as he defected. In 2004, I started to write down all my thoughts in a diary. I didn\u0027t know if I\u0027d get caught. I just wanted to let it be known where I was from, and where I wanted to go. After I left the North, I became very depressed, hiding in the mountains alone for a while. The people who were watching over me told me not to come down to the village and left me by myself in a mountain shelter. Alone, with no one to engage with or talk to, I felt like I would go insane. So I wanted to leave something behind in case I died there or got caught - that\u0027s why I started to write.Alone in the mountains, I desperately sought something to talk to. That was my diary. My diaries are proof of my life\u0027s journey. I read them when I want to remember home. I can\u0027t return home, and I already have no memories of my hometown. But when I go through my diaries, there are notes which detail the vivid memories of that time. Sometimes I might forget my father\u0027s birthday, but when I go back to my diary, his birthday and my mother\u0027s birthday are there. My diaries are a record of my life. They prove I\u0027m alive.North Korea has been preparing for an extravagant celebration for its national foundation day on 9 September.The festivities are intended to be a spectacular homage to Mr Kim’s campaign to bolster his country’s image abroad and ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula through diplomacy with its neighbours and the US.Diplomacy with China and Russia appears to be progressing, with reports Chinese tourism to North Korea is already on the rise.But it remains to be seen whether the initially successful negotiations between the north and Washington will progress, after Pyongyang called on Washington to make a stronger effort to build confidence and assure its security before it gives up its nuclear weapons.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/14/15/senator.jpg","title":"australian senator fraser anning final solution muslim immigration","story":"Created with Sketch.Crossbencher Fraser Anning widely condemned for his isive remarksClick to followIndy PoliticsAn Australian politician has provoked outrage after using the term “final solution” in an incendiary\u0026nbspspeech about immigration, in which he called for a plebiscite asking voters whether they want to stop\u0026nbspMuslims and those “from the third world” from entering the country.Queensland senator Fraser Anning’s provocative maiden speech called for an immigration program that favours “European Christian” values, claiming it would protect Australia from potential terror attacks.We as a nation are entitled to insist that those who are allowed to come here predominantly reflect the historic European-Christian composition of Australian society, the Katter’s Australian Party upper house MP said.Trump isn’t the only one whose immigration policy is doomed to failLaura Ingraham defends her immigration comments, disavows David DukeIf Trump got his way, Melania\u0027s parents would be illegal immigrantsMr Anning, who replaced Malcolm Roberts in the Senate back in June, called for “a plebiscite to allow the Australian people to decide whether they want wholesale non-English speaking immigrants from the third world, and particularly whether they want any Muslims”.“The majority of Muslims in Australia of working age do not work and exist on welfare.

RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: \u0026ldquoStrengthening the tyre labelling regulations is good news for UK motorists and road safety generally.Currently, there is no requirement for tyre fitters to show labels at the point of purchase so motorists are oblivious to the pros and cons of the tyres they are buying.As a result few motorists are shown the labels when buying tyres, leaving them completely in the dark about the three ratings of fuel efficiency, wet grip and passing noise.Updating the regulations should fix this by making it mandatory for tyre labels to be shown to motorists in all situations.\u0026ldquoInformation on tyres\u0026rsquo snow and ice performance is going to be included which will be very beneficial.The labels are also being future-proofed as the amended regulations allow for the addition of other useful information such as ratings for mileage, wear and a potential indication for re-treaded tyres.

Less heat in a solar minimum is due to a decrease in magnetic waves.The sun was not expected to head into a solar minimum until around 2020, but it appears to be heading in earlySpace Weather says: \u0026ldquoThe phenomenon could be linked to solar minimum, now underway.

Don’t they know many thousands of people agree with him? Or do they chose to again ignore the people of this country? Any movement on Boris from the out-of-touch Government will cost them dear.SO Dominic Grieve has threatened to quit Parliament if Boris Johnson became PM. I can think of no better reason for wishing him success.BANG on Boris, about the burka. It being worn in public is scary for children who see it.FREEDOM of speech must not be compromised – and there can be no question of legal action being taken against Boris Johnson, it would be prejudiced by all the attacks on him.THIS week it has been especially hard to be a Muslim woman. Apparently I am not getting the joke, I’m over sensitive, bullied, oppressed, unintegrated, politically motivated, dividing Britain – this list goes on. Perhaps Boris Johnson’s Etonian education did not enable him to understand that in polite society it’s rude to comment with ridicule on the way people dress.ONE thing critics of Boris Johnson’s burka comment overlook is the impact of burka-wearers on those who are deaf and rely on seeing facial expressions, and lip-reading.THE do-gooders complaining about Boris are fanning the flames of hatred by highlighting issues that one wouldn’t really think about. Talk about “integration” appears to be one-sided and discriminatory towards the indigenous people. There is some equilibrium lacking in our “fair, just and equal” land of ours.WHILE I am not sure Boris used a good choice of words likening women in burkas to pillar boxes, he was right that we are frightened by what it represents. We must not destroy Boris, he is good for the people of this country, he cares. He must also be allowed to speak honestly, he has nothing to apologise for.LIGHTEN up, Boris spoke the thoughts of many millions of Brits. If making a gaffe was against the law, Prince Philip could have been banged up in the Tower of London on many occasions during the last 50 years. He wrote the book on it.Boris might have an agenda – what politician doesn’t? – but this mustn’t mean people don’t have a right to voice criticism. Face veils in public, and burkas, are not religious requirements and we must have the right to criticise the wearers.IF I was Boris Johnson, I would agree to attend the diversity training some have suggested . . . and then tear the training session to pieces.I SAW Ranvir Singh berating her guests on morning TV for daring to agree with Boris Johnson? I wonder what her bosses would say if she suggested that she presented her programme wearing a burka. I think we all know the answer to that.PHIL GROWDENNOTHING Theresa May says can be taken at face value. Not so long ago, she promised to stop the witch-hunt of British soldiers, who have seen action and survived in many parts of the world. However, the victimisation of our veterans continues unabated. They are now joined by Boris Johnson, who has frequently ignited the Prime Minister’s wrath and must therefore, be thrown to the wolves.A BUS company has apologised after a driver told a woman to remove her niqab. So would a bank apologise if a security guard asked a man to remove his ski mask?HOW would I stand as a Christian male finding a Muslim lady, dressed in a burka, having a heart attack? Would I be allowed to remove her veil to perform mouth-to-mouth?THE controversy surrounding Boris Johnson’s burka comments has reached ridiculous heights. Police conducting an investigation. Really?IF Theresa May had the guts to ban the burka like a lot of other countries, we might not be having this discussion about what Boris Johnson said.SOMETHING featureless with a rectangular hole in it can resemble a letter box, there’s probably one on your front door, go and have a look. It has also been known for the person inside to be a terrorist, not an innocent woman. Stop being so pathetic, have a sense of humour, act like adultsI READ about a motorcyclist at a filling station having to remove his crash helmet while a woman (who could have been a criminal’s getaway driver) filling up at the pump next to him was wearing a burka. Meanwhile Boris’s remarks are causing hysteria.I HAVE been visiting garden centres and supermarket car parks in my car, which is bedecked with Brexit stickers, asking many people their opinion on the Boris situation. For Boris, I find there is a great deal of love out there. For the Chequers “deal” there is none.IT’S true that Boris Johnson has used strong language but Muslim terrorists are doing far worse things than robbing banks, by committing terrorist atrocities. It would be a sad day when the Muslim community can’t take such a comment, especially when many Muslim women, in my view, do not want this clothing themselves.IT’S confirmed, lunatics are ruining the country. We have the enemy (EU) knocking art the door and all the idiots can find to discuss is Boris Johnson’s perfectly fair comment. If it wasn’t so serious it would be funny. Brexit should be top of the agenda.THERE are easily as many people who agree with BoJo’s comments as those who don’t. So why is it those who don’t will instigate an investigation, leaving those who do without a voice? Even senior Muslims and imams have said that the burka is not a requirement in Islam, so why is it we only tend to listen to those who are offended?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Last Leg is a television safe space, the authentic voice of the PC establishment and as predictable as the sun rising in the morning.So you knew, long before Friday’s transmission, that they’d be targeting Boris, who is a thousand times funnier and edgier than anyone on this show, in his own way.Nearly a whole working week host Adam Hills and his two mates had to prepare some decent material as well, and this was the best three professional comedians could do.Alex Brooker: “The burka is an item of clothing worn by a human being, the other is a postbox, you f***ing idiot.”Adam Hills: “I’d much rather sit next to a person in burka than a p***k in a suit.”Josh Widdicombe: “Theresa May has only just realised Boris is a t**t, so she should apologise as well.”On and on it went, for 12 minutes and 54 seconds, a figure I mention because I’ve had the clock on this lot, and if you want to know exactly how much of a toss they really give about religious sensitivities then it’s best measured by the fact this series of The Last Leg has devoted just 65 hand-wringing seconds to the anti-Semitic poison infecting the Labour Party.It was crammed hurriedly into the previous episode, which was worth watching just to see Adam Hills describe Corbyn’s handling of this crisis as “a faux pas”, (which isn’t French for “shameful cluster-f***”) and the C4 audience react with evident discomfort because he’d drawn attention to the Labour leader’s failings and, therefore, broken one of comedy’s secret and golden rules.If you doubted these rules exist, incidentally, then ever the virtue-signalling fool, Adam Hills was good enough to spell them out for us on Friday.“Every religion should be open to ridicule . . . but you kind of need to be in the club.“Alex and I can make jokes about disabilities as we’re technically disabled.”Boris, he then explained, can’t make jokes about burkas, ’cos he’s “a white Etonian”, nor could comedy giant Rowan Atkinson defend him, as he was “a white man who lives in Oxford and drives an F1 car”.Even if we ignore the fact he’s assumed that all Muslims are black, something pretty staggering is going on here.For Mary Whitehouse, in all her pearl-clutching glory, never imagined anything quite as Draconian and controlling as this form of satirical Apartheid.Adam Hills has a point, though, when he uses the word “club”. That’s exactly what television comedy has become.A closed, left-wing shop where you don’t even bother joining the audience unless you follow the rigid “Tories and Brexit are evil” party line.This is not creating comedy, it’s policing it, and also the reason why applause has replaced laughter on all those Channel 4 and BBC news satires which have failed to realise there is only one simple rule to be observed when creating these shows: Make it funny, dumbo.I would suggest, at this point, Adam Hills gets off his moral high horse, for once, and gives this “funny” idea a go.But then I could also ask Boris to have a crack at anchoring the British women’s 4x100m relay team to gold at the next Olympics, wearing a burka, and I’d know there was only the remotest chance of one ever happening.Run Boris, run.MEANWHILE, back on Channel 4’s Meet The Drug Lords: Inside The Real Narcos, Jason “Foxy” Fox was with the Colombian navy this week and desperate for a look inside one of the incredible home-made submarines they’d confiscated from drug-smugglers.“Is it locked?”“Yes.”And there’ll be more Bafta-worthy action from Foxy and his forward-planning department this week, I’m sure.EVER since it discovered that Danny Dyer was the rightful heir to the English throne, Who Do You Think You Are? has been struggling to find a purpose, or indeed a celebrity, who could see the bigger picture.That special someone who would acknowledge history’s great events with more than a few “wows” and shrugs and not think their own career made all of their ancestors’ suffering worthwhile.Finally, last night, they found him.Judge Robert Rinder, who as well as having the best brain at ITV (Luna the Labrador off This Morning has the second best) also turns out to be a natural television journalist, telling the story of his maternal great-grandfather, Israel, and his beloved grandfather, Morris, simply, beautifully and without ever letting the details overwhelm him.The former fled revolutionary Latvia at the turn of the last century.The latter’s entire family was wiped out in Treblinka’s gas chambers.Yet he somehow survived the Buchen-wald, Theresienstadt and Schlieben concentration camps and made it to Britain, which offered him salvation, friendship, justice and, above all, a sense that “life is worth living” that has been passed down through eternally grateful generations.It’s a remarkable story, so if you missed it, try to catch tonight’s repeat (BBC1, 11.25pm).SCENES and characters the viewers are unlikely to forget in a hurry on the final episode of BBC2’s wonderful Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.First stop, the President’s Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida, where Ed spent the most uncomfortable night of his life, since Strictly, at a one-year-in-office party for Trump, with Toni Holt Kramer and a group of fans who were called The Trumpettes, but could well have been the provisional wing of The Golden Girls.If you thought they were a bit sinister, though, he was then off squirrel hunting in the forests of Georgia with two hillbillies who might not have been plucking banjos but they certainly had the mad cackling laughs and slightly unsettling line in hospitality.“Are you ready to be a man today, Ed?” asked one, as you began to wonder if he could escape with his dignity intact, let alone blend in with the local gene pool.Then he suddenly reappeared – and this was a masterstroke – wearing a Norwich City scarf.Scrub everything I ever said about Ed Balls.The man’s a diplomatic genius.Sent in by Rob Milner, East Yorkshire. Picture research: Alfie SnellingTHIS Morning, Wednesday:Gok Wan: “Coming up, Ninja nanas, in a minute, John Torode’s in the Lake District at 11.45, and we’ve got the return of the Hawaiian shirt at midday.“First, would you like to live ten years longer?”Ten years?

It means young people are missing out on essential skills as they approach adulthood.GRANT ROLLINGS asked five Sun columnists what their first part-time jobs were and the valuable lessons they learned – from being polite to skiving.I ALWAYS had a summer job, usually it meant working full-time hours on my normal Saturday job as holiday cover. This was either in a boutique such as Chelsea Girl or in BHS, where I worked on the sweetie counter.I coped with the boredom by sneakily munching on the best chocolate sweets from the pick-and-mix. I also worked as a waitress in a trendy Glasgow eaterie during the holidays.All of these jobs gave me the most enormous respect for the men and women who toil for long hours, often dealing with unreasonable members of the public for too little pay and not much prospect of promotion.Working in the service industry taught me the power of a disarming smile, and proved that my old granny’s saying that “you get more in life from sugar than vinegar” could not be more true.Grumpy customers demanding refunds and diners moaning that they had been waiting too long for their main course were usually placated with a swift apology and a promise to sort things out.A major restaurant blunder could often be smoothed over with a free coffee or pudding.MY favourite summer job came in 1977. I was a traffic enumerator for Middlesbrough Council. That meant I spent all day counting cars. All the way up one side of Linthorpe Road, all the way back down the other.I had to write down all the number plates. In the end, I got a bit bored and spent the time hanging out at my mate’s T-shirt shop or Fearnley Records and made the numbers up, always remembering to have them end in the local codes of HN or (I think) XG. I hope the council thought it worthwhile.It was better than the glue factory, where I’d been very briefly working on a weighbridge. Foreman pressed a button and this vast door opened and thousands of rotting animal carcasses fell out. I can still smell it now, all these years later. I passed out — soft lad, you see.Or there was working the nightshift pricing cans of food and stuff in Hintons, the local convenience store. Every time I turned up, the manager would say, ‘Here he is, the poor man’s Rod Stewart’.A friend of mine, Mark, had a much better summer job.He was a Club 18-30 holiday rep. He shagged 21 girls in 25 days, which gave me my first story to sell to the national newspapers.MY first holiday job was in the summer of 1985 when I was 16 years old. I had already been turned down from working at Waitrose in Enfield Town on the basis I was “too glamorous”.That just goes to show how far we have come in such a short time. I have never set foot in a Waitrose since that day because I was beyond furious. Anyway, the job I did get was working in a hairdresser’s on Goodge Street in London.My journey involved three changes and about 14 stops every day. The job was meant to be answering the phone, sweeping up and generally helping out, but before the end of the first week I was running the till, the appointment system, cashing up and generally managing the place.The only thing I could not do was cut hair, but that didn’t stop me cutting my friends’ hair — with very mixed results, more bad than good — on the basis I worked in a hairdresser’s so they thought I should. I remember the liberating feeling of earning my own money, it gave me the greatest sense of independence, self-esteem and self-belief.I worked out I was actually good in a work environment, talking to people — for example, talking women into perms they didn’t want — being responsible, handling money and making a difference to my employer.The biggest transition we make in our lives is leaving education to go into the workplace, and summer jobs prepare you for this.I HAD dozens of summer jobs, from working as a scaffolder’s mate with a convicted murderer, who kept a pistol in the glove compartment of his Ford Escort, to donning a white suit and Geiger counter to carry out maintenance on the core of the main reactor at a nuclear power station.I learned a hundred things from each and every job, but it was working as a grocery assistant at my local supermarket that had the most impact.My best friend and I both got jobs there at the same time. He was a star performer at school, a brilliant academic, but he couldn’t take the pace and got fired after a couple of months.It was incredibly hard, repetitive work.The manager was an ex-Army major — very strict on haircuts, discipline and stealing.There was always the prospect of the Tannoy announcement “customer service one hundred”, which was code for a shoplifter having been spotted.All the male floor staff were required to assemble at till number one to tackle the suspect, who would sometimes become violent.I was much happier making the cheese look pretty and eventually became the ruler of the entire soft dairy aisle — a project I’m still working on.I WAS 13 in Brownes Wine bar, Stafford Street, Derby, summer 1987, some years before it burned down in mysterious circumstances (has a bar ever burnt down innocently?). I was chief bottler-up.This involved the soul-sapping exercise of sifting through bins taller than me for all the recyclable bottles from the previous night’s festivities and putting them in their correct crates. This took all morning and you ended up cut to shreds and stinking of Britvic and Schlitz.I was then asked to be the cook — this involved microwaving lasagne for drunk people. I was paid the princely sum of £3 per hour. I realised how crap this was, so one scorching Saturday I nicked the shampoo that came with my dad’s company car and took advantage of the sketchy Eighties attitude to drink-driving and washed all the customers’ cars in the car park for a fiver a pop.I literally cleaned up. It was the greatest Dragons’ Den moment I’ve ever had. I waxed on and off all day, rinsing my dad of his prized BMW product. He arrived to pick me up and I was minted. A 13-year-old with £64 in his pocket. That coveted Swatch would finally be mine.He then told me the dog had been run over, so that’s another memory ruined.Thanks for reminding me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To say that he was “present but not involved” is an insult to voters’ intelligence when photographs show him holding a wreath and gurning for a nearby camera.To allow his press office to say the widows of those murdered in Munich were being “misled” is, even among the many shameful episodes we’ve seen since he became Labour leader three hate-filled years ago, disgraceful.The most vital qualification for power in this country must be integrity. And Jeremy Corbyn has demonstrated this week that he has absolutely none of it.But for all of the shame that he brings upon Labour, it is nothing compared to the spinelessness of the party’s “moderate” MPs whose opposition to Corbyn extends not much further than wishy-washy tweets.“Present but not involved” isn’t an excuse for Corbyn but nor is it for the cowards on Labour’s backbenches.Corbyn cannot be allowed near government. But the rest of the party has lost the public’s faith too.TOMORROW, official figures are likely to suggest that train fares will go up by another 3.5 per cent in January.If you’re a commuter who has put up with delayed and cancelled trains, you’ll be wondering what you’re paying for.After a disastrous year, there is no other industry that would turn round and ask customers for even more.The failure of the Government to take responsibility, blaming unions or claiming the cash is for “investment”, is simply not good enough. It’s the same as last year’s excuse.It is time for a radical overhaul — but that does not mean nationalisation. Far from it. Our railways need MORE private sector involvement.The hybrid system we have, in which private operators rely on publicly owned tracks and have their fares regulated by government, has led us into the worst of both worlds.Transport supremo Chris Grayling needs to take on the unions once and for all.

He says he was told that he couldn’t speak at the wedding and that Harry berated him on the phone for mishandling the Press while he was recovering from a heart attack.The official royal response to these outbursts has been, effectively, to shove their fingers in their ears and shout la-la-la (or lah-lah-lah).The snobby courtiers and hangers-on dismiss Markle père as fame-hungry.That’s not altogether wrong — he is clearly desperate, as he proved by posing for snaps with the paparazzi in the run-up to the wedding.But it’s not good enough to wish he’d just go away.Meghan is now one of the most photographed and sought-after women in the world. Her very well-paid PR flunkies should have seen these familial landmines a mile off and defused them.But they have failed.Thomas Markle is a difficult and proud man, no doubt. But that is why he should have been treated with care, not frozen out.Why did Team Windsor not find him a role and approach him long before the wedding to make sure he didn’t feel excluded.It’s hard not to feel for him.His ex, Meghan’s mother Doria, was hailed as one of the stars of the wedding.Because she’s a black woman, she invited lots of gushing commentary about the monarchy becoming more diverse and modern.Amen to that. But poor old podgy Thomas, an awkward-looking white bloke, has been shunned from his daughter’s nuptials. You can’t blame him for speaking out.The royal courtiers enjoy the adulation the monarchy receives because Prince Harry has been “brave” enough to marry a woman with a complicated background.But the Palace spin machine freaks out when it comes to confronting the reality of Meghan’s parentage.Perhaps they just find it too vulgar.Harry’s PR man is Jason Knauf, an American specialist in “crisis management” having worked for Royal Bank of Scotland. He excels at sending angry letters to journalists he feels have gone too far snooping into Harry and Meghan’s private lives.But he doesn’t seem to have a clue as to how to handle his clients’ grumpy relatives.As a result, the monarchy is facing arguably its worst crisis since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.We are often told how brilliant the Royal Family’s PR is. Part of the new royal spin, in fact, is about how great the royals now are at spin. They have “rebranded” the monarchy for the 21st century, and so on.Look at the blizzard of positive guff accompanying Prince William, Kate, and Harry’s campaign for mental illness last year.They were, it was said, making the younger Windsors seem more touchy-feely.At the moment, however, they don’t seem sensitive enough to speak to Meghan’s suffering in-laws.That’s not what you’d call a good look.The truth is, royal press officers have long got too much credit.The British admire the Queen because she is admirable.Overall, we prefer monarchy to any other system of government. That’s just common sense. It’s nothing to do with any ingenious branding and media strategy.The public also feels that the younger royals deserve a chance.At a time when our country is consumed by Brexit and political arguments, the wedding of Harry and Meghan came as a blessed relief — something we could all celebrate.The couple both came from broken homes, and nobody cared so long as they were happy. That’s all great.   But it’s obvious that Meghan has, as one royal expert put it, “background baggage that needs unpacking”.Insiders now say the treatment of the Markle family has been a “shambles”.This is before we consider the potential PR bombshells that could erupt if and when Meghan’s ex-husband, Trevor Engelson, decides to grant some interviews.The British don’t want to see the monarchy turned into a reality TV soap, as the Markles and Windsors wage a media war with each other.It’s trashy and embarrassing.But unless the Palace can tackle Meghan’s disgruntled kin, that’s exactly what is happening.Maybe we need a changing of the royal PR guard — before it’s too late.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead, he tried to block it out -  using music as a distraction.But after months of torment, Kyle resorted to trying to cut the sinister presence out of his head once and for all.In pure desperation, he took a blade and hacked into his skull just above his right ear - the point where it sounded like the voice was coming from.He passed out from blood loss. When he came to, the voice told him hed killed someone and Kyle believed it.Scared and confused, Kyle told a stranger that hed committed murder, and she called the police.Kyle then ran - fearing hed be locked up - and called his mum.When she found him, he had blood all over his face and had no choice but to confess everything about the voice.He was sent to a mental health ward, where he stayed for a month.Hes now using a combination of medication and therapy to get rid of the voice which has ruined his life - or at least quiet it down - and has a new job as a valet.In many cases, talking with therapists about the origins of voices can help to ease sufferers worries, and many can use the same coping mechanisms as people with anxiety to remain calm during intense episodes.But hell always bear the knife scar on his head, and for many people with schizophrenia, they must live their lives in the knowledge that the voices will never fully go away.Symptoms of schizophrenia can include having muddled thoughts, undergoing behavioural changes, and experiencing hallucinations and delusions.In some people, schizophrenic behaviours start suddenly, while they develop over time for others.Mental health charity Mind says: Some people think hearing voices means someone is dangerous, when voices are actually more likely to suggest that you harm yourself than someone else.Its also important to remember that people have a choice in whether they do what the voices say.The NHS says you should see your GP as soon as possible if you are experiencing the symptoms of schizophrenia.More information is available on the Mind website. Emmalina is sweeping the floor in her kitchen when shes interrupted by a sinister voice.Im going to kill you when you go outside, it says.Nobody else can hear it, but according to Emmalina, its the voice of the devil - a regular presence who torments her at her lowest moments and leaves her too scared to leave the house.Shes been hearing voices since she was eight and talking back to them for the past three years.As well as the devil, she lives with a voice called Katie - her closest friend - and the voice of her mother.Katie helped me get through really tough times when I was younger, Emmalina says.Emmalina endured sexual abuse and bullying in her childhood, and experts say that early trauma is often associated with hearing voices or developing multiple personalities.I wouldnt have got through childhood without Katie, Emmalina says. My life was unbearable.But Katie isnt always supportive of her.Emmalina says that in the past, Katies voice has told her to cut herself and to smash her own wrists with a hammer.The voice also routinely abuses her, calling her a fat b***h while she eats and even filling her head with racial slurs on the rare occasions when she ventures away from home.These days, Emmalina finds it difficult to leave the house at all, thanks to the increasingly frequent influences of the voice she attributes to the devil.Speaking in a sinister, upper-class accent, it routinely tells her that shell be killed if she steps outside.Im going to burn the skin off your bones, it says. Im going to drag you down to hell. Im going to get you.The voices threats have become so debilitating that Emmalina had to leave her job as a nursery assistant, and now relies on a support worker to try and control her condition.Schizophrenia is often misunderstood, and Australian TV show You Cant Ask That recently aired an episode where sufferers address misconceptions about the condition.Sufferers say that taking medication can suppress the voices, but at the height of their illnesses some reported hearing the voices of dead relatives, unborn children and - like Emmalina - the devil.Sandy can hear two voices, one male and one female.“They used to sound really crass in the way they spoke, but in the last 10 years they’ve done elocution, she says on the show.So now my voices abuse me with a posh accent.“They will tell me how evil I am, how disgusting I am, how disgusting I look, how my face is revolting, how if people touch me they will die because I will contaminate them with my oozing evil.”Other schizophrenic episodes have seen sufferers starve themselves - believing they were being told to by the Grim Reaper - and become convinced that theyre the target of government conspiracies.I have this lingering delusion in the back of my mind that Tony Blair has implanted a micro-chip in my left ear to delete my thoughts, Sandy adds.Fellow sufferer Steve adds: I hear voices all the time. Even just sitting here.“In the early days when I was unwell, if I didn’t do what the voices told me to do they would just get louder and louder and louder.For Chaz, the emergence of a voice which she calls Victor almost proved fatal.Victor has been an unwelcome fixture in Chaz life since 2013, but she was too scared of being sectioned to tell anyone about it.The voice heaps constant abuse on her, telling her that she has no right to be alive and that she can end the torment by killing herself.You should die, the voice says, during one particularly nasty outburst. Just die.After eight months of Victors constant goading, Chaz jumped from a bridge.I didnt want to hear it any more and I wanted everything to disappear, she says. I dont really remember being on the bridge.The police shouted my name. I turned towards them, turned back towards the bridge and just stepped off.Today, the former skateboarder is in a wheelchair as the result of the suicide attempt, which left her with a broken foot, two smashed wrists, a fractured pelvis and a fractured sternum.Chaz still hears Victors voice, and it sometimes even teases her about the day she almost died.I put you in a wheelchair, Victor says, and Chaz hears a foul-spirited laugh inside her head.Now, Chaz refuses to let Victor control her life. She writes and recites poetry about her condition to try and drown the voice out, and hopes to find love soon.I know its hard for anyone to be my friend, she says. But I do actually want to meet people. Id like a girlfriend.But its hard to get someone to stay around.

Quickly it began to grow larger and became painful to touch.She was referred to an eye specialist at NHS Teeside by her GP, but the cause of the swelling remained a mystery.There was no scarring or inflammation on the upper eyelid, just a lump close to her nose.An MRI of the eye showed a cyst behind her left eye and she required surgery to remove it.It was during the surgery that doctors realised the cyst was a hard contact lens.But it still didnt explain where the contact lens had come from.Then her mother remembered that she was hit in the eye with a shuttlecock while playing badminton when she was 14.At the time she was wearing contact lenses but one of them wasnt found, so they assumed it fell out.She suffered swelling around the eye that eventually went down and she never wore hard contact lenses again.We can infer that the lens migrated into the patient’s left upper eyelid at the time of trauma and had been in situ for the last 28 years, Dr Sirjhun Patel wrote in the BMJ case report.The patient also had a droopy left eyelid, which doctors assumed was also caused by the rogue contact lens.Her vision was not damaged and she made a full recovery once the lens was removed.The migration of a rigid gas permeable (RGP) lens into the eyelid is a rare cause of eyelid swelling, Dr Patel added.Spontaneous migration of a hard contact lens into the eyelid is a relatively known occurrence, but we were only able to find four reported cases of lens migration secondary to significant trauma.This case report exhibits the longest time between traumatic RGP lens migration into the eyelid and presentation of eyelid swelling."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004266613892.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labour mp refuses six times to say jeremy corbyn is fit to be pm and hints he could be ousted as leader next month","story":"Madeleine Moon failed six times when asked to say if the Labour leader was fit to become Prime Minister.She blasted him for dominating newspaper headlines with negative coverage over his controversial trip to Tunisia in 2014.He has admitted he laid a wreath to honour members of the Black September terrorists who killed 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich 1972 - but refused to apologise to the widows for attending.After pictures emerged of him at the ceremony at a cemetery in Tunis, Mr Corbyn initially denied he was involved - saying he was marking the deaths of 47 people in Israeli airstrikes in 1985.But he has since changed his story several times, and now faces a House of Commons probe over failing to properly declare the trip to the authorities.The Labour boss has come under increasing pressure this week, which comes on the back of the partys ongoing anti-Semitism crisis.And today Ms Moon, the MP for Bridgend, hinted that Mr Corbyn could face moves to oust him as early as Labour’s annual conference in Liverpool next month.She told TalkRadio: “Individuals as leaders come and go.

But they were barely 16 miles out when they were tracked down by English Commodore Charles Wager, in command of four British ships including HMS Expedition.Wager’s plan was to seize the San José, the largest ship in the fleet. But before it could be boarded, something went terribly wrong and the San José blew up.Writing in his log, Wager described an explosion so intense that he could feel the heat from his own ship.He wrote: I believe the ship’s side blew out, for she caused a sea that came in our ports. She immediately sank with all her riches."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000426177001.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"960\" width=\"960","title":"woman apologises pushing taylor smith bridge canada","story":"Jordan Holgerson cracked five ribs and punctured her lung and “could have died” after belly-flopping into the Lewis River in Vancouver, Washington, on Tuesday.The Sun Online revealed that Taylor was later seen partying with friends “as if nothing happened” after the shove which left her friend unable to walk.The teen was caught posing with a friend at the Clark County Fair in a post on Instagram on Saturday.A close family source told Sun Online: “Taylor has been going out as if nothing happened.“Shes been at a pool party and there were pictures of her at the county fair with a friend on Instagram.

Around 46 per cent of 25 to 34 year-olds now live in private rentals as house prices rocket.Some 80 per cent of the tenancies in England and Wales are set at six or 12 months.Charities warned this leaves tenants at the risk of eviction at short notice- and demanded a change.Shelter chief Polly Neate last night said the Government’s decision was “very good news” that would transform the lives of many struggling to make ends meet.She said: “The current renting system is a complete mess, with families teetering on the edge of blink-and-you-miss-it six-month contracts – barely enough time to set your broadband up, let alone see your kids through school.“This problem will not be fixed by giving landlords a tax break to coax them into doing what everyone should be doing anyway.”Shelter earlier this week said 55 per cent of private renters believe longer tenancies would improve their situation.And they claimed two-thirds of renters would think better of a political party that brought in longer contracts.GOT a story?

Yesterdays employment figures revealed that the proportion of young people unemployed (and not in full-time education) is now at a record low of 4.7% for our country - and far lower than for many other developed countries.It sends a significant message out about the drive and innovation of our young people, and the opportunities that our economy offers to them and their future.With our welfare changes this country can now be powered forward by this young generation.Since 2010, youth unemployment has fallen by over 45%, giving 130,000 more young people a job, and a future.Add the fact that wages are on the up and there are more than 829,000 vacancies nationwide, it’s clear that young people are entering the best jobs market in a decade.On average, the number of vacancies has increased by 4,280 each month over the last year, and those vacancies span from construction to technology.So when young people this week are deciding on their next steps, they can think big as there are plenty of opportunities out there for them, from a job with career progression, to taking up an apprenticeship.Look at Daisy, who turned down five university offers to work at global engineering firm JCB designing new equipment, and she didn’t have to go to university to get there.I’m forever being told, and intrinsically understand, that people want to study at different times in their lives, often inspired to do so when they see the practical benefits of their studies.That’s why so many people prefer, and do better, getting a job first and then studying for exams while they work.Even over the last few decades, how the world of education and work are linked has shifted dramatically. People no longer have one job for life, and lifelong learning is becoming more and more commonplace as people dip in and out of education.Many more people up-skill and retrain throughout their career – and this is how the future jobs market will remain vibrant and strong.And when I speak to employers up and down the country, from manufacturers to marketers, what they want are young people with the right attitude, prepared to work and learn. As they say, ‘if you’ve the will, we can give you the skill’.So when young people this week are deciding their next steps, the academic route isn’t the only option.You can now become a solicitor, an accountant or even a nuclear engineer through the apprenticeship route, earning as you learn and without the cost of going to University. Studying a Higher Apprenticeship gives an average wage boost of £150,000 over a working life.When I speak to young people around the country, I’m impressed with the confidence and self-assuredness with which they look to the future, and the range of options they consider beyond traditional routes.Im certainly no job snob. Life teaches you its not where you come from, its where you get to, and work is exactly the same.You can start anywhere and get to the top as Im repeatedly being told by our countrys top entrepreneurs.Top performers in their fields such as Debbie Moore, Jean-Christophe Novelli, Deborah Meaden and Jo Malone, did not go to university and are just a handful of the individuals who show that with drive and determination you can succeed by treading your own path.Its all about getting a break and taking the opportunities that come your way.So best of luck to everyone today, but whatever your results, there are many opportunities and pathways into a successful career.    Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If they go on to university they incur debts of over £50,000 and will be paying back their loans well into middle age. And in a number of cases they end up with degrees that dont get them into graduate jobs.On the other hand, degree-level apprenticeships are almost non-existent with less than 10,000 available each year compared with over 300,000 university places. There is effectively no viable alternative to university.Jeremy Clarkson had some words of advice for students who fell short of what they hoped to get.He tweeted: Dont worry if your A-level grades arent any good. I got a C and 2 Us.And Im sitting here deciding which of my Range Rovers to use today.And ITV news anchor Alastair Stewart also wished students good luck.He wrote: However you do, remember: in 5 years they wont matter too much in ten, not at all in 20, theyll probably be called something else.Boys have outperformed girls at the top A-level grade for the first time since it was introduced in Northern Ireland.They overtook girls by 0.4 per cent at the A* grade, which was first awarded in 2010.The performance gap between the genders also narrowed at the A*-A grade boundary, and it follows concerted efforts to address the disparity by education authorities.Last year, 26.3 per cent of A-levels scored an A or A*, national figures showed, and the results were predicted to be broadly similar again this year.There have been major changes to A-levels in England, with a move away from coursework and modular exams throughout the course.A Department for Education spokesman said university isnt for everyone and the Government does not want one route to a career to be considered better than any other.That is why we are transforming technical education in this country to put it on a par with our amazing academic system, he said.Students who havent got the results they hoped for can try their luck through clearing.The process works by helping students find out what university courses still have places remaining.Hopefuls are able to search for a course against the subject they are interested in, or the university they want to head to."},{"url":null,"title":"a level results day memes twitter","story":"Teens have been sharing their funny reactions to the big day on under the hashtag #alevelresults2018 -

When students are young, academically brilliant and getting great grades, they should know that’s an option.Back in 2016, he told students at the Oxford University Guild: You guys did something I couldn’t do, which is get sick A Level grades. It was my dream to come to Oxford and study Political Science.Stormzy follows in the footsteps of Nicki Minaj, who pledged to pay tuition fees for her young American fans in 2016.The news has been welcomed by fans and politicians alike.Labour MP David Lammy heaped praise on the rapper, writing on Twitter: Well done Stormzy for giving back and leading the way, once again. You dont need to use your power and platform to bring others with you, but you do it anyway.And Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner added: Great news that #Stormzy is trying to help 4 black students get to a top university, my job is to ensure the system enables all students to reach their full potential regardless of gender, disability, race or class background.Today teens across Britain are receiving their A-level results - and finding out whether they got into uni.But eight of ten courses today STILL had spaces left, as students appeared to turn their back on higher education.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, you must have been getting your news from the BBC, then.This was the latest example of Corbyn simpering around terrorists. Honouring scumbags who massacred 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich.The Black September gangsters castrated their male victims while they were still alive.But then, Corbyn was happy to attend the funerals of dead IRA terrorists. That’s the kind of chap he is. Actually, I say that was the “latest” case of Corbyn simpering around terrorists.Not quite. A day or two later a photo emerged of him giving the salute of the Muslim Brotherhood, a foul organisation proscribed as terrorists in six countries.And it’s all part of the anti-Semitism scandal which is tearing the Labour Party apart. An important story.Good people have left Labour as a consequence. The Jewish community in the UK is in uproar.Frightened of the far Left’s support for vile Islamists and its loathing of Israel and its right to exist.Scared of the morons who now lead Labour and its retinue of lefties who have said the most appalling, racist, stuff about Jews.Jeremy Corbyn, a genuine halfwit, thinks it is all “fake news”.He rolls his eyes when asked about it and gives different answers every time he is questioned.And guess who agrees with him? Yep, the BBC.The corporation refused to touch the story for a whole day, when it was first reported by blogger Guido Fawkes. Ignored it.Everyone else — including the left-wing  — thought it important.Instead, the front page of the BBC’s online news carried no fewer than SIX stories about former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and the allegations of Islamophobia made against him. Six!Boris had likened women who wear the burka to letter boxes or bank robbers.The vast majority of the country agreed that he wasn’t being racist. The vast majority want the burka banned here — as it is in Denmark, France, parts of Germany, Belgium and . . . Morocco.His comments were not much of a story at all. And the moves to sanction him solely a case of his enemies in the Conservative Party gleefully hammering the bloke.But the BBC became obsessed by it. It is always obsessed when the word Islamophobia is mentioned.And it loves to stick the boot into the Tories. Yet was utterly silent on the latest example of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.It took them a full day to even mention the story.It’s another shocking case of the BBC’s bias. A left-liberal prejudice which runs right through the corporation from top to bottom.The same prejudice you hear whenever it deals with immigration (bloody marvellous!) or Brexit (absolutely ghastly!).Haven’t we had enough of this? Enough of paying £150.50 every year to have these credulous dupes pipe liberal propaganda into our homes every day.Get rid of the licence fee. Let the BBC survive through the subscriptions of those who are willing to pay. And on that deal, I’m out, Evan.Heres a photo of Rhian Sugden dressed as a plum.I’ve included it this week so that Tess Daly can enjoy it.Her husband, the uniquely interesting Vernon Kay, had a long sexting relationship with Rhian, apparently.And Tess was a bit hacked off.So maybe this will cheer her up.I’m on a diet. One of those low-carb things. God it’s boring.My favourite kinds of food are fat and carbohydrates, preferably mixed together.At night I dream of mashed potato and steak and kidney pudding.How can people enjoy life on a diet of bloody stir-fry?And the worst thing is it doesn’t seem to have done much for my weight. I still look like a pregnant middle-aged lesbian in a Boris Johnson wig.If the pounds don’t fall off soon I’m going to give it up. And BINGE.There’s a restaurant round my way that does a chicken parmo with a pizza on top.That’s where I’ll be heading.Freda Jackson, aged 81, did not enjoy her holiday and is demanding that the tour company refund her the full cost.Freda went on holiday to Spain and found herself surrounded by Spaniards...who wouldnt complain?Her complaint? The hotel she was staying in was “full of Spaniards”. Well, fair enough. They can be annoying. They get over-excited and spoil everyone’s fun.Where was Freda on holiday? Spain. Freda thinks she should have been warned about the possibility of being surrounded by Spaniards in Spain.She added that they should go “somewhere else” for their holidays.Brits are flooding to Turkey to take advantage of the crashing lira. You can get a holiday for two-fifths of nowt, apparently.All well and good. But you would have to pay me a lot of money to go anywhere near Turkey.The reason it’s cheap is because the moron who runs the place, Recep Erdogan has wrecked the economy. And there will be big trouble there soon.Fancy a change in your career plans? There’s a new job just come available – head of the Islamic State.The post is open to male psychopaths with very large beards. Must be able to scream “Allahu Akbar” in a very menacing manner. Salary negotiable.Small print at the bottom probably says: “The Islamic State is not an equal opportunities employer. So, no women, gays or Jews, please.”This job has come up because the previous leader, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi (Bob Baghdad to his mates) got hit in a drone strike. According to the Islamic State, he is now brain-dead. Hmmm. How could they tell?A year or so back I was in a minicab at night on my way home when we approached the level crossing near my house.The gates were open and the driver, a foreign bloke, drove into the middle, stopped and said: “Sorry, left or right?” I looked at him to see if he was joking.He wasn’t. I said: “I would go straight on if I were you.“This what we, in this country, call a ‘railway line’.” I assume it’s his wife, then, who was caught driving her car along the Newcastle  this week.And only noticed she was actually on a railway when she pulled up at a station.An art student decided to do something about the bright light coming in through her window.There are a number of solutions, aren’t there?Curtains, for example. Or maybe some nice blinds.But nope, instead she covered her window with a painting. It was called Double Anal Penetration and was quite, um, graphic.The neighbours kicked up a bit of a fuss.There was also the suggestion the police could be called. The student’s name, incidentally?

The 24-year-old was on a first date with web designer Jack Shepherd, whom she met online. He was trying to impress her with the champagne-fulled trip past the Houses of Parliament but drove at twice the speed limit, before the boat hit a log and tipped over. Shepherd, 30, went on the run instead of facing trial but was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence in his absence and jailed for six years. His refusal to face justice has left Charli’s family grief-stricken, frustrated, and with endless unanswered questions about that night in December 2015. Here Charli’s older sisters Katie, 29, and Vicky, 31, from Dartford, Kent, write an open letter to Shepherd.   Dear Jack Shepherd,  We both want you to know the terrible impact losing Charli has had on our lives. Katie heard the news of her death after a morning teaching science to secondary school children. A colleague gave her the message: “Please call your mum – \u0026shysomething has happened to your sister.” She wondered if Vicky, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant, had her baby prematurely. But as soon as Katie heard mum’s sobs and words: “It’s Charli”, she said: “What has he done?” Call it intuition or a premonition, but somehow Katie just knew something had gone terribly wrong the night before. It began during your date when Charli started sending WhatsApp messages telling of the food you ate at the restaurant, and champagne on the speedboat.  That evening, Katie’s second last message to Charli said: “Please let me know you have you survived this \u0026shyescapade?” Charli didn’t answer. That night Katie couldn’t sleep. First thing the next day, she texted her concern: “Charli, are you alive?” That message wasn’t delivered to Charli’s phone, found in her pocket when they pulled her body from the river. Vicky was having a check up at the maternity hospital when she took mum’s call. She had a panic attack. Vicky remembers nothing except the sound of her own wailing. Hearing our baby sister was dead was the worst moment of our lives, until we had to identify her body. We went to the mortuary together with our parents, all hoping it wasn’t our Charli. As soon as we walked into the room and saw her, Mum and Vicky collapsed. Such deep trauma was dangerous for Vicky at such a late stage in pregnancy.  Her due date was December 29. But because of the distress caused by losing Charli, Vicky suffered a series of mini strokes and was admitted to hospital on December 20. She was induced for her and her baby’s safety, and because Charli’s funeral was planned for January 5 2016, and Vicky was terrified she’d go into labour as we said our final goodbyes. Because of you, Charli never met her gorgeous youngest nephew Edward, who was born on Boxing Day. Now Edward is two, the same age as your child who is growing up fatherless. Coming back to serve your time, and seeing your child, is surely better than a lifetime on the run, constantly looking over your shoulder? We urge you directly: give us answers and give yourself up. To any of your friends reading this, please know the net is closing in so you’re just delaying the inevitable. Jack, you’re young so facing justice and serving your time still gives you a chance of having a life, career and family.  Your reckless and cavalier attitude robbed Charli of that chance. But you can never take our memories of our glamorous, bubbly little sister. We remember Charli’s lovely confidence which made her comfortable meeting Vicky’s in-laws for the first time wearing huge rollers in her hair. We can laugh remembering her fearsome competitiveness playing crazy golf. We are both eaten up with anger about the loss of Charli, we both have an empty feeling of grief which feels like it will never end and a sense of living in constant shock. Our pain is indescribable. We were brought up as three very close sisters often mistaken for triplets and are now only two. At family Christmases, weddings and anniversaries we lay a place for Charli at the table. Seeing it empty makes every happy occasion sad. We spend Charli’s birthday at her grave. Time isn’t healing. We hurt just as much as we did in those first few weeks after Charli’s death. Our bereavement left us unable to function. Yet you married a woman you’d got pregnant within a month of the tragedy. We are stuck in an emotional fog because when you fled the court case, you stole our chance of closure and left us with unanswered questions.  You might expect us to lash out with threats or name-calling. But our family has too much dignity and decency. We know you don’t have a shred of either – because if you had a tiny speck of a conscience you’d have turned up at the Old Bailey to finally answer questions about the night you killed our sister. Instead, showing complete lack of respect for us and the legal system, you ran away. Your barrister excused your absence as cowardice. It’s also extreme arrogance and despicable selfishness. We wanted to hear what really happened that night you took Charli out on the Thames in a speedboat bought on Gumtree to “pull women”, as you smirkingly told police. Now we might never know. Why did you pester Charli for a date, tracking her down on Facebook after she blocked you on a dating site? When you knew of the dangerous debris in the Thames, why did you drive the boat at more than twice the speed limit in the dark?  Why take such risks while so drunk you didn’t know Charli’s name, or your own next of kin, when you were in the ambulance? We believe Charli would have survived if she had worn a life jacket. Why on earth didn’t you offer her one when you had two on board? So many questions. But our main one is: do you have any remorse? In the oppressively dark grief we searched for something good to come from Charli’s death. That has to be our petition to clarify and tighten laws covering dangerous driving and drinking while in control of a private boat. We won’t stop until we have at least 10,000 signatures so the Government will consider amending the very loose laws. Hopefully new rules will save lives and will one day be known as ‘Charli’s Law’.

No-one died. The terrorist was caught alive. There is no martyr, and if the worst they can do is smack their heads against a reinforced anti-terrorist barrier next to the most heavily-guarded building in Britain then, frankly, there\u0027s not a lot to lose sleep over.  Except there is, because as with every terror attack the hardest questions that must be asked are not, while official knees jerk to protect themselves.  Attacks on Parliament bring home to MPs that they are targets for those who take exception to their views, their politics or their existence. It\u0027s natural that after the second car-based attempt at mass murder on their place of work in 17 months, they would start to think that cars might be the problem. Only we don\u0027t say men are the problem, even though every single terror attack carried out on our shores of late has been conducted by people with testicles. The Islamists who have attacked us may have been Muslims, people of colour, slightly-thick zealots, and one-time petty criminals, but we have not and will not outlaw all such people for the crimes of a few. Boris Johnson would be stuffed, for a start. Yet some say it\u0027s time to pedestrianise Parliament Square. Because terrorists are never on foot, are they?   Terrorists have never been in cars, then got out of them to kill someone, have they?    Terrorists have never targeted places where all their potential victims are walking or sitting down, have they?   Terrorists are always the driver, aren\u0027t they?  Terror attacks often lead to changes, many of them useful. When the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel in Brighton it led to stringent security measures for party political conferences. After 6 were killed and 50 injured at the Westminster Bridge terror attack, Theresa May promised another \u0026pound50m for counter-terrorism, having earlier been criticised for cuts.  And let\u0027s not be too architecturally-conservative about Parliament Square. It was laid out only in 1868, around the same time as the Victorians rebuilt the Houses of Parliament. It is a space owned by the Greater London Authority, which has the power to make bylaws for it, and has used this power in recent years to repeatedly curb the right to protest.  While there is a right to assembly on any public highway, on the roads around Parliament you must ask for police permission. So, on the face of it, pedestrianising the area - putting even the roads under local authority control, banning cars which happens anyway for approved protests, and keeping weapons-on-wheels away from the seat of our democracy - may seem like a sound idea. But it isn\u0027t.  Manchester Arena is not a public space, is privately-owned, and keeps its concert-goers away from vehicles. Salman Abedi still managed to blow himself and 22 others to pieces, killing and injuring huge numbers of children.   Abedi used a backpack and a suitcase. Parliament Square attracts millions of tourists a year, most of them with backpacks and suitcases.  Perhaps police and politicians would like bollards at the entrance to the square to include x-ray scanners, to catch those carrying bombs or knives in their backpacks?  In which case, we can look forward to everyone with a penknife or nail scissors being stopped, liquids being bagged and belts and shoes removed at the entrance to the square, just as they already are when you attempt to enter Parliament itself. And anyone who wishes to stage a protest or go to the TV studios at Millbank to criticise the government, will not only have to seek formal approval but be questioned as to their purpose on the way in and the way out. At this uncomfortably-authoritarian juncture, it might be wise to remind ourselves of the few times in recent history that Parliamentarians have actually been attacked.  Jo Cox MP was shot and stabbed on the roadside in Birstall, West Yorkshire in 2016 while on her way to meet constituents.  Stephen Timms MP was stabbed twice at a constituency surgery in a library in Beckton, east London in 2010.  More recently, Conservative life peer David Prior was the victim of a pig blood-based graffiti attack in his own home by an angry ex-girlfriend. When a brick was thrown through Angela Eagle\u0027s office, Stella Creasy was threatened with rape and Jess Phillips given death threats, it happened either in their own constituencies or online. And who could forget when deputy Labour leader John Prescott was egged outside a theatre in Rhyl, north Wales, in 2001 when on his way to a political rally.  As yet, no Islamist has yet come within 10 yards of a Parliamentarian at Parliament. Those who have launched attacks outside have not got in, and it has become quite apparent that while cars are good at killing pedestrians, they are rubbish at getting past armed police officers, metal barriers and brick walls.  Of course a Parliamentarian could be outside on his bike, as others were yesterday, or walking over Westminster Bridge, or coming through the gate at the wrong time. So could any one of a thousand other humans, and it is not for the public\u0027s sake anyone has suggested banning vehicles.  It has been suggested purely to look like something is being done - even though that thing would not deter a single terrorist. We have yet to hear of an incident averted because a devoted Islamist saw a \u0027keep off the grass\u0027 sign. They are not known for being law-abiding, and it should be noted that this latest attack involved an illegal turn on the wrong side of the road, in clear contravention of the Highway Code.  You can say this for cars being used as weapons - they tend to at least keep the driver alive. And if you ask any counter-terrorism officer what he\u0027d like most after a terror attack, he\u0027d say someone to interrogate.  He might further point out that, in his ideal world, the terrorists come to him. They choose the most-guarded, secure and bristling-with-police-officers building in the country, and run at it one at a time, almost as though they were idiots.  Parliament is a place that can handle terror. Blocking it off to cars does not stop terrorists - it just moves them down the road, to Tesco or the Tower of London or Top Shop. And there isn\u0027t a person on the planet who can\u0027t see that an attack on soft targets is not only easier for even the most stupid of zealots to manage, but it\u0027ll kill an awful lot more people.   Pedestrianisation is the go-to solution for every politician from the local town hall to Downing Street. Banning cars is the only way they can think of to boost local cafes, cut pollution and, now, protect democracy. Never mind that business rates, car manufacturers and sanity might all have more to do with it.  The ability to drive, in cars, taxis or buses, and to walk or cycle unhindered, through Parliament Square does two important things. First, it means millions of us get to see the place close up. On visits, school trips, holidays, the daily commute and in tiny glimpses on our way to somewhere else, we are reminded it is there, and that it is ours. If it were pedestrianised it would be seen only by those who seek it out.

The Home Secretary spoke out against the small rise for officers that was dictated by Mrs May and Chancellor Philip Hammond. The spat - fresh evidence of Mr Javid\u0027s willingness to speak his mind against the PM - came after the Prime Minister\u0027s rejection last month of a recommendation by the Police Remuneration Review Body on officers\u0027 pay. Officials outlined Mr Javid\u0027s views in a letter, seen by The Daily , in July to Downing Street.   . Mr Javid wanted officers to be given a one-off bonus of 1% that would effectively give them 3% rise but was overruled and a 2% settlement was announced instead.  The Home Office letter states: As you will be aware, the Police Remuneration Review Body recommended the consolidation of the 1% non-consolidated award for police officers from 2017/18 and, following that consolidation, a 2% consolidated increase for officers at all ranks from 1 September 2018.  The Home Secretary was strongly in favour of this. However, the PM and Chancellor have decided that officers should only be given a 2% consolidated pay award, meaning only a small 1% pay rise in reality. He continues to be of the view that this is the wrong decision. When the pay award was announced, a Home Office press release said that despite the recommendation of the review body, police employers advised that the maximum affordable award would be a 2% increase.

This right-wing Tory has an obsession with privatisation but the real way to restore the network is to run it as a key public service, owned and operated by Great Britain.  By slashing state investment, the austerity-obsessed Conservatives have left us with crowded, dirty trains which are too often late if they turn up at all.

Always on time, well organised and, based on all the conversations the Ku Klux Klan’s members had with him, a powerful advocate for their hateful racist politics. What they didn’t know was that Ron was a black police officer. In 1979, Officer Stallworth, then 29, spent a year infiltrating the KKK and exposing their links with the police, military and organised crime. His audacious scheme, which started when he saw an advert in his local paper asking for potential KKK members, has inspired what some critics have called “the most important film of the year”, BlacKkKlansman. But in many ways, the truth is even stranger than Spike Lee’s movie makes it out to be. Working as an intelligence officer for the Colorado Springs Police Department, Ron was the only black officer on the force. So he took the rising tide of racist violence very seriously. And when he answered that advert, picking up the phone to talk to local KKK organiser Ken O’Dell, Ron knew he was risking more than embarrassment if they found out who he was.  America was gripped by far-right terrorism in the 1970s. In 1971, KKK members used dynamite to blow up ten buses which were to be used to desegregate schools in Pontiac, Michigan. In the months when Ron was planning his scheme, five communist protestors demonstrating in a Death To The Klan march were killed by the KKK and the American Nazi Party in the Greensboro massacre in North Carolina. In 1980, four black women were shot in Chattanooga, Tennessee, after a KKK rally. Just six months, later Michael Donald, age 20, was lynched in Alabama, his body found hanging from a tree. With this kind of bigoted violence going on, it’s fair to say that Ron knew the kind of character he was supposed to be playing when trying to ingratiate himself with the KKK’s O’Dell. Ron said: “I eventually spoke with him over the phone responding to that ad, and he explained to me that he was starting a Klan chapter in Colorado Springs and was looking for new people. “So I told him that I was a white man, that I hated blacks, Jews, Mexicans, Asians. That I thought the white man had not gotten a fair deal in this country. “[That] I was really upset because my sister had dated a n***** and it offended me that his black hands had touched her white body. And, as a result, I wanted to join the group and do what I could to put a stop to all of this nonsense.”  That was all it took – Ron, who now lives in El Paso, Texas, with his wife, was in. But very quickly he knew he was going to get caught if he couldn’t solve a major problem. How could he, a black man, walk into the public meetings of a large and violent racist organisation dedicated to seeing him back in chains? He was fine dealing with them over the phone, but he knew that when it came to having face-to-face meet-ups, he couldn’t go himself. So he drafted in his friend, Chuck, who worked in the drug squad, to be Ron Stallworth in person. It was also at this point that Ron realised he had – perhaps shortsightedly – signed his own name on his first letter to the KKK. However, it wasn’t just the practical problems holding up Ron’s investigation. Senior officers took a while to be convinced of its merits. “They felt like they couldn’t lose investigators to a bunch of nonsense like ‘men running around in sheets’,” said Ron. But with no signs of America’s racial violence subsiding, senior officers eventually agreed. Ron arranged to meet O’Dell, who was a serving soldier, at a bar near Fort Carson military base. He sent Chuck in wearing a wire, and guided him through the tricky conversations. “That’s how we conducted this investigation over the next eight or nine months or so,” Ron said. “I did most of the talking on the phone with these individuals, and when it came time for physical contact, the face-to-face meeting, I would send the white officer in posing as me.”  After months of phone calls and secret meetings, the infiltration was going so well that, incredibly, O’Dell recommended that Ron be made the head of the Colorado Springs branch of the KKK. He was put in touch with the hate group’s leader, David Duke. At one point – clearly confident that his plan hadn’t been rumbled – he even asked the KKK’s leader about the threat of infiltration. Ron explained: “I said, aren’t you afraid of an undercover police officer infiltrating your organisation or maybe a black man calling you up and pretending to be white?” “He said no, he wasn’t fearful of that at all, because he could always tell when he was talking to a black person.” Pushing his luck, Ron asked how Duke knew that he wasn’t black. “He said, you don’t talk like a black man. You talk like a very smart, intellectual white man. I can tell by the way you pronounce certain words.” Then, in an incident that seems more like far-fetched movie plot than real life, Ron – in his role as a serving police officer, rather than an undercover agent – met Duke in person. He was tasked with protecting the so-called Grand Wizard while he delivered a racist rant in public. He said: “I went and introduced myself to David Duke without giving him a name and told him I would do everything I could to protect him, even though I didn’t agree with him. We shook hands and I became his bodyguard.” Ron’s investigation in many ways highlighted his worst-possible fears. He found Klansmen in all walks of life, from local shop owners to school teachers and his neighbours.

This week watchdogs banned it from claiming that it can guarantee next-day delivery for customers using its Amazon Prime service. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled the claim misleading because “a significant proportion of Prime labelled items were not available for delivery by the subsequent day”. Amazon has also faced a storm over complaints that it\u0027s not paying its fair share of tax. Earlier this month the Mirror revealed that it paid just \u0026pound4.6million last year despite UK sales soaring by a quarter to \u0026pound8.8billion. British retailers with similar UK sales paid up to 20 times as much tax. Now one business seller using the service is claiming that Amazon allows cheating customers to unfairly get chargebacks. SaveMyLight sells lighting components and claims that Amazon has a policy of refunding buyers “at the drop of a hat to keep them happy”. The Midlands-based retailer says its customers have been refunded even when they don\u0027t return goods, or return goods that have clearly been damaged while in use, and some have even got refunds after returning goods that SaveMyLight does not sell. “The chargeback procedure on Amazon is in chaos and being continually abused with more and more buyers exploiting this now openly known loophole - buy goods, file chargeback, get money back, keep goods,” says sales manager Steven Williams. “Amazon are complicit in this by not ensuring goods are returned as per the Consumer Rights Act and instead wish to keep their buyers happy by simply removing funds from our seller account. “There are many other Amazon sellers affected and for us this has been going on for years.” He says that the problem is made worse by the difficulty in communicating with Amazon, with emails being unanswered. “If you telephone Amazon Support the call is answered by a Philippines operator who cannot assist,” he complains.

Nicholas Keith Warner, who arrived in Ireland last week, appeared at Limavady Magistrate’s Court charged with attempting to murder three men, two of them aged in their 30s and one aged in his 60s.  The three men each sustained stabbing injuries in an incident outside a bar at Main Street in the Co Antrim village of Ballycarry last Saturday night.  Warner, an electrical engineer from Morrow Lane in Summerville, South Carolina, denies attempting to murder the three men and he also denies assaulting a fourth man. The defendant further denies causing an affray but he admits possessing a knife.  The defendant, who sustained a broken leg in the incident, was helped by two police officers as he walked on crutches from a cell van on Main Street, Limavady, into the courthouse for his remand appearance. His wife Kaylee, a nurse also from South Carolina, sat behind her husband as he sat in the dock during the hearing. When asked by the court clerk if he understood the charges, the defendant replied “yes mam”. A detective constable told Deputy District Judge Ted Magill that he believed he could connect the defendant to the charges and he said alcohol was an issue in the case. Defence solicitor David Jones told the court that bail conditions proposed by the police and by the Public Prosecution Service were acceptable to the defendant.  “He accepts he was the individual who caused the injuries. From the moment of his arrest prior to his interviews he accepted he possessed the knife to defend himself”, Mr Jones said. “This case will come down to the argument of reasonable force or otherwise and because he is a US citizen I would request that if possible the case could be fast tracked. It is regrettable in that he is here on his honeymoon and his employment as an electrical engineer is now is jeopardy”, Mr Jones added. The defendant was released on his own bail of \u0026pound1,000 to appear at Ballymena Magistrate’s Court on September 6.

Using information compiled by \u0027s data department, we can reveal the best and worst performing schools.  Wembley High Technology College in Brent, London is the top school in England, while Cockshut Hill Technology College, Birmingham, has ranked last.   In Wales, Bishop Of Llandaff Church In Wales High School in Cardiff tops the rankings.  This is the sixth edition of the Real Schools Guide which is the most comprehensive guide ever on state-funded secondaries. The unique rating system uses 51 different measures, put together from the latest publicly-available data and broken into four categories – attainment, teaching, attendance, and outcomes. While national league tables may only examine GCSE results, the Real Schools Guide looks at schools which help all students to make progress, even if they only get slightly better than average exam scores overall.   See below to search for your school   Even those that include the new Progress 8 measure may overlook schools helping all pupils do well. The ranking system aims to give parents a better idea of which schools will help their child prosper, no matter what their background may be. The guide shows interesting trends with 80 per cent of the top 20 schools in England based in London and the South East.  What do you think of your school\u0027s performance? Email webnews@mirror   Four our of the top five schools in England are based in London. Just four of the schools are from the north and midlands with two form Lancashire, and one each from Liverpool and Reading. As well as this, girls-only secondaries make up half of the top performing schools in England\u0027s top 20.    In Wales\u0027 top 20, a quarter of the top schools are based in Cardiff while 25 per cent of the worst secondaries are in Flintshire. The top two worst performing schools in Wales, Glyn Derw High School and Michaelston Community College, both in Cardiff, were closed last summer to make way for the new Cardiff West Community High School. Other factors are also included in the data such as whether all pupils are making progress, attendance rates, the ratio of teachers to pupils, school finances, and whether students go on to further education or jobs. Attainment is worth 30 per cent of the total score. This is based on pupils’ Attainment 8, EBacc and GCSE performance in 2017.   Whether a school is getting top marks and if its GCSE results are improving year-on-year is also measured. Progress is worth 40 per cent of the score and is based on how well all as well as different types of pupil do in comparison to expectations and how well the school does at closing the gender gap. It also looks at how big the pupil/teacher ratio is in comparison to the national average, as well as teachers’ average salaries. The attendance score is based on absence rates, looking at both overall levels of sessions missed as well as unauthorised and persistent absence at the school. It is worth 15 per cent of the total score. Outcomes is also worth 15 per cent, and is based on what proportion of pupils continue with education, employment or training after Year 11, and what proportion leave employment, education or training within three months - in comparison to the national average.  Schools that had no Year 11 pupils taking Attainment 8 qualifying subjects in 2017 are not rated.  Speaking about Wembley High Technology College topping the list, Cllr Amer Agha, Brent Council’s Cabinet Member for Schools, Employment and Skills, said:     “Our aim is to ensure that every child in Brent has the best start in life possible, and so having one of our schools recognised as the best in the country, is hugely satisfying and testament to the hard work that’s been put in by everyone at the school.        “Coming a month after the council’s best-ever Ofsted rating and a few months after a Brent teacher won the Global Teacher Prize, this is another great day for Brent’s young people and I offer my sincere thanks and congratulations to all those involved.” The unique rating system uses 50 different measures, put together from the latest publicly-available data and broken into four categories - attainment, progress, attendance, and outcomes. National league tables may only look at overall GCSE results, as well as newer measures. Attainment This is worth 30 per cent of the total score. It is based on pupils\u0027 average grade attainment score, including what the average scores for different groups of pupils were, as well as the proportions gaining the English Baccalaureate and those getting A* to C grades in GCSE subjects. It measures whether a school is getting top marks, and if it is managing to improve year-on-year. Progress This is worth 40 per cent of the score. It is based on how well different types of pupil do in terms of progressing. It also looks at things that may contribute to teaching outcomes, such as how big the pupil/teacher ratio is in comparison to the national average, as well as teachers\u0027 average salaries. Attendance This score is based on absence rates, looking at both overall levels of sessions missed as well as unauthorised and persistent absence at the school.

Charlie Vyse was pinned down in the middle of the fast food restaurant, while the stranger, believed to be 13-years-old, slapped and kicked him. The little boy suffered wounds to his legs, hands and arms as a result of the bloodied assault, which his mum Jessica believes could have killed a child. Jessica, 25, said: I was terrified. Hearing your child cry, because he was screaming... it was probably one of the worst things that I’ve ever been through. As a mum, it’s just so horrific. I can’t even imagine how much that hurt because her whole weight was on him pinning him down while she was biting him. It was horrific.  Jessica, Charlie and his little sister Elsie, two, were on their way back from a family day out when they stopped at the McDonald’s in Hampton near Peteborough, Cambs. He had been holding his mother\u0027s hand but she turned round after feeling his hand slip out of hers to see the girl on top of him. A woman, believed to be the girl\u0027s mum, was telling her to stop and allegedly said ‘I’m sorry, she’s autistic,’ according to the mother. Jessica said the girl was “hitting, scratching, biting. Down his back, his bottom, his legs.”  She said: I leaned down and I was saying ‘oh no, jump up’. As I got down to lift him up, I realised the girl was shaking her head and her teeth were in his back. He was obviously hysterical. “Charlie was still crying. I managed to pull him away slightly but it was at least 30 seconds, and she was biting him all the way down his body as I dragged him. “She was biting, hitting, scratching him. Then I fell back myself and had Charlie on top of me because I gave one last tug.”  The mum, who is a student children\u0027s nurse, pulled her children away to the disabled toilets where she found blood running down a tearful Charlie’s back. They then left McDonald’s, despite the girl allegedly trying to attack Charlie again, who was left “completely traumatised”. Jessica claims the police initially failed to investigate the incident which happened in July but have since made inquiries.  Jessica says Charlie is now receiving support and counselling due to the trauma caused. She said: Charlie is getting the support he needs and counselling from the relevant people, so hopefully we can move forward from this. I just think the whole thing has touched upon a subject that is clearly delicate but that needs addressing. Jessica shared a post about the experience on social media, which has since been shared more than 7,000 times.

Developer Paul Mager said he didn\u0027t know the underground pipe was there until after the two-storey, detached house was already built. He decided to matters into my own hands and tear down the house in Tetney, Lincolnshire, amid a row with Anglian Water that he didn\u0027t think he would win. But it could only be the start of his trouble, as the local council says it received no prior approval for the demolition work, Grimsby Live reports.  Bulldozers moved in to demolish the executive house on Wednesday morning, sparking bemusement from neighbours. Mr Mager said the construction work could have ruptured the main, which serves homes across Cleethorpes and Waltham, leading to a major disaster. The head of Mager Homes Limited said: The detached house that is as we speak coming down has been built on the main water main from the Tetney Blow Wells. So that detached house has been built on the main water main artery that runs into Waltham and Cleethorpes. So to cut a long story short, having tried to do a deal with Anglian Water, it became apparent that the best thing to do was to take it down and re-site it.  It\u0027s a bit more complicated than that. But I have had a major row with Anglian Water and it looks like I was going to lose so I took matters into my own hands. Built on top of a main taking water from Tetney Blow Wells nature reserve, the house has never been occupied. It was approved in 2016 by East Lindsey District Council as part of an application for seven properties on Humberston Road. Mr Mager said: In order to avert that puncture taking place, the quickest thing was to take it down in order to avoid any damage to Anglian Water property. That little corner will be flattened and we will resubmit a planning application to redevelop in a different way.  I am not going into the argument with Anglian Water. But basically either the house had to move or the main had to move. For piece of mind, I decided to move the house on my own timetable. Mr Mager said the main only came to light after the house had been constructed. He said: I have been doing it all my life. If we had known it was there, we would never have done it. The ongoing demolition came as news to East Lindsey District Council\u0027s planning department, who said no prior permission had been given for the work. Development control service manager Chris Panton said: “This is the first we have heard of the demolition currently ongoing on Humberston Road, Tetney.

The transformation first came into fruition after Matt Opie, who topped the scales at nearly 16 stone, thought he was going to \u0027die\u0027 running after his son at their local park in Plymouth. Desperate to make a change to their lives, he and his partner Naomi, decided to head to their local Slimming World. Since they embarked on their weight-loss journey, the couple have said that their marriage has improved and has made them even better parents to their boy, Jack. It\u0027s been no easy feat and Matt was anxious at first about taking the plunge with so many other women around him aching to trim down.  Speaking to Plymouth Live , Matt said: When I first went, I walked in and there were 40 women in there, and perhaps two or three men, and I just thought, this isn\u0027t a man thing to do.   That\u0027s what people would think - but it\u0027s changed our lives. When I started, I was 15 stone, 11 pounds, Matt explained. I\u0027ve managed to lose four stone - I had diabetes as well and that\u0027s gone. It\u0027s taken me 10 months. It sounds a bit funny, but we were laying in bed the other night and we were saying about all the extra room we\u0027ve got now. We\u0027ve lost more weight than what Naomi weighs now. You would think there were three of us in this bed. It\u0027s absolutely crazy. Naomi\u0027s journey is quite remarkable - she\u0027s shifted seven and a half stone and has not put on a single pound since she started weighing in at Slimming World last year. Matt reflected on what made him want to change his life.  My son has problems and we were seeing him at school, I was trying to get him but he was having a meltdown and I thought I was going to die having to try and run after him, he explained. As soon as that happened, I knew things had to change. My son has been diagnosed with ADHD - and now I can do more stuff with him. When he was going to the park and I was trying to run after him, I was out of breath. It may seem stupid to some people, but we are having more fun as a family now, doing more stuff together that we wouldn\u0027t do before like taking selfies. You should see the photos we had previously. Now, we\u0027re just taking selfies with everything. It feels like we\u0027re making up for lost time, Matt admitted.  We didn\u0027t really have family photos up before, now we\u0027re going to places like the zoo and taking lots of photos. Matt said the couple\u0027s weight climbed as problems got worse with their son. Struggling to get him to bed, they felt too exhausted to cook - and relied on their local takeouts to keep them going. But that only fed their weight problems - and made them feel exhausted and stressed. I was having four or five takeaways a week, sometimes twice a day, Matt said. Matt says - a diet full of salad and vegetables and swapping out chips for jacket potatoes. I eat salad and veg every day now, Matt said. Jacket potatoes - in my 37 years I had never eaten one until I started Slimming World and now I love jacket potatoes. We live on the third floor and we have a lift. For the last year, I\u0027ve probably only used it three times. I would definitely advise any man to do Slimming World - it\u0027s changed my life. It changes every part of your life.

I have contacted everyone and anyone that I possibly can and nothing seems to getting done about it.  It feels as though there is one rule for one person and another rule for others. It\u0027s an eye sore - I\u0027m not sure they are even stored correctly. He\u0027s put 30 tons on a trailer. First, the lorries came and they were full of hay bales and he put them in place one by one. So we\u0027ve got three in a row. More and more bales were put on top - there might be a row of seven or eight - I\u0027m not entirely sure now. You can see it from the road, you can see it from the footbridge.  It\u0027s about ten meters from my home - if they were to fall then they would destroy my garden. I thought they were a fire risk but the fire brigade said to me they\u0027re not a fire risk. The farmer has been trying to put a planning application through now for the past eight years. He wants to create a site to process waste. The application has been rejected not just by ourselves but by the whole village. It just seems because my house backs onto his farm - that we have to bear the brunt of this. Another resident on the street said: The view from our back garden used to be open fields but now all you can see is a wall of hay.  I\u0027m convinced this is some kind of protest against the village because the farmer didn\u0027t get the planning permission he wanted. It\u0027s a form of intimidation and is just simply being done out of spite. Speaking from his farm in Ockbrook, Derbys., where he lives with wife Samantha, 50, he said: It\u0027s got nothing to do with the planning application for a waste processing site. Where am I supposed to put my bales? They [the residents] are selfish - all they think about is themselves. All they want to see is green land but I don\u0027t even get that view and its my farm. I\u0027ve got my property here, I can\u0027t put them [hay bales] on my drive because there\u0027s no space - I\u0027ve got sheds in the way too. There\u0027s a dual carriageway on the other side I can\u0027t put them there. He added: They\u0027re making a straw mountain out of a molehill. I put them in the middle of the field and they complained about that and the council told me to move them. Now I\u0027ve moved them they\u0027re complaining again. All they\u0027ve done for the past few years is try and portray me as some horrible neighbour and horrible person. It\u0027s not their fields - I live literally next to the bales too. The fire brigade have come out and said it\u0027s not a fire risk. I don\u0027t know why they called me a bully - I\u0027m not a bully. I\u0027ve lived here my whole life - my mum and dad have lived here too - we\u0027ve always farmed. I\u0027ve never not farmed and they\u0027re telling the council I don\u0027t farm.

DeeAnn Fitzpatrick, 49, accused fellow fisheries workers of mocking and targeting her in a campaign of sexist harassment. The Canadian woman claimed a racist and misogynistic culture within the Marine Scotland office in Scrabster drove her to contemplate suicide. But an employment tribunal has rejected her claims despite a photo showing her gagged and taped to a chair appeared to back up her claims, the Daily Record reports. That evidence was time-barred.  In an earlier hearing in Aberdeen in June, Ms Fitzpatrick alleged she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010. The tribunal heard how she was bombarded with fake Valentine\u0027s Day and birthday cards she believed came from male colleagues A message in one called her an “old troll” and another warned her about trying to “climb the ladder of success”. Ms Fitzpatrick told the tribunal the harassment was so bad she considered taking her own life and contacted an assisted suicide clinic. She told the tribunal: “When I first started getting the cards, it made me feel awful. But as they continued, yes it’s affected my self-esteem. “It’s actually made me become a recluse - I stay at home, I have gone more into myself. With everything going on, I contacted Dignitas in Switzerland. I had enough.” Ms Fitzpatrick, who has worked for Marine Scotland since 2006, was struggling to grasp the tribunal’s verdict.  She said on Wednesday night: “It is difficult when you spend your entire career fighting racism, misogyny and bullies. “Then to make matters worse when you report the incidents, you are the one that is being targeted by an ongoing campaign by senior management because you exposed what they have worked very hard to hide.” The Scottish Government put up one witness, Judith MacKinnon, its head of people advice, who has over 25 years experience in human resources. MacKinnon took up the job last year but said those who dealt with Ms Fitzpatrick’s complaints were too scared to appear because of the intense media interest.  But she backed the decisions taken by junior staff who found insufficient evidence to back up Ms Fitzpatrick’s suspicions about the letters. However First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs she was “absolutely horrified” when shown the photo of Ms Fitzpatrick allegedly taped to a chair and gagged. She has ordered a top civil servant to conduct a full review into the circumstances and report to her personally. Ms Fitzpatrick’s sister-in-law Sherry said: “The Fitzpatrick family are hugely disappointed with the result of the tribunal.

In total, 26.4 per cent of UK entries were given one of the two top grades, according to data published by the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ). This is up 0.1 percentage points on last year. However, figures also show that the proportion of A-Levels handed the very top result has fallen to its lowest level since 2013. One in 12 (8.0%) entries scored an A* grade this year, down 0.3 percentage points on 2017, statistics published by the council show.  The overall A*-E pass rate has also fallen 0.3 percentage points to 97.6%. This is the lowest level since 2010.   A Level results day 2018: All you need to know when you get your grades and what to do next  But the percentage of A-Levels awarded an A or A* is the highest since 2012, according to a Press Association analysis. It is the second year in a row that the A*-A pass rate has risen. Boys continue to outperform girls at the highest grades, the figures show. While 26.6% of boys\u0027 entries were awarded at least an A grade this year, this was the case for 26.2% of girls\u0027 entries. The statistics also show that STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths) are continuing to rise in popularity. More than a third (36.2%) of all A-level entries were in these subjects, up from 34.5% last year, and 28% in 2009.  Male students are still more likely to study a STEM subject than females, but the balance is shifting, JCQ said. More girls take biology and chemistry than boys, while more boys take maths and physics. But the data also shows that girls are closing in on the boys, with a 3.1% increase in maths entries from female students (boys\u0027 entries for the subject have risen 2.1%) and a 6.9% rise in physics (2.4% for boys). More than half a million students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are finding out their A-Level results today after an anxious wait. It comes in the wake of a major exams overhaul - with 24 A-level subjects now reformed. There has been a move away from coursework and modular exams, with sixth-formers instead sitting their exams at the end of two years of study. There have been major reforms to A-Level qualifications in England - with a move away from coursework and modular exams.  Instead, sixth formers sit their exams at the end of two years of study. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: We reformed A-levels after universities told us they were failing to prepare students for higher education. Reducing the number of exams students have to sit will give them more time for study and to gain a deeper understanding of the courses they are studying, an essential skill for undergraduate study. We know exam season can be a time of heightened emotions for pupils wanting to do their best but while testing has always been an important part of education, it should never be at the expense of a young person\u0027s wellbeing. That\u0027s why the Government is investing \u0026pound1.7 billion to promote, protect and improve young people\u0027s mental health. Grades have been awarded for the first time this summer for new A-levels in languages, geography, dance, drama and theatre, music, PE and religious studies. They join the 13 A-level subjects for which the first grades were handed out last summer. Maths is in the process of being reformed and a small number of grades were handed out for the new qualification this summer. Most students have been awarded grades after studying the old A-level course. Overall, the subject is still the most popular A-level, with 2,383 more entries this year compared to 2017. Michael Turner, JCQ director general, said: Students, and teachers, should be congratulated. They can be confident in their grades, knowing they have been achieved in a world-class system that is robust, challenging and fair.  It comes as early figures have showed there has been a fall in the number of students accepted on degree courses at UK universities. In total, 411,860 students - from the UK and overseas - have taken up places, according to initial data published by admissions service Ucas. This is down 1% compared with the same point last year A breakdown shows 353,960 UK students have been accepted on to undergraduate courses, down 2% on 2017. But there is an increase in international students, with 26,400 EU applicants accepted to study at UK universities - up 1% on last year. And a record 31,510 students from nations outside the EU have taken up places - a 4% increase. The figures are a snapshot taken by Ucas shortly after midnight.    The admissions service said that in England, a record 27.9% of the 18-year-old population has been accepted on to courses, with a record 26.3% in Wales. In Northern Ireland, the entry rate is 28.1%, while in Scotland - where results were published last week - 25.9% of 18-year-olds have been accepted. Clare Marchant, Ucas chief executive, said an increase in the proportion of youngsters from disadvantaged background was excellent news. Some 16.1% of those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds have been accepted - up 0.4 percentage points. She added: However, the continuing gap between the most and least advantaged is frustrating, and we\u0027ll keep on working with universities to help them evaluate their outreach activities to impact the most disadvantaged students. The encouraging growth in international students choosing to study in the UK is testament to the welcome of our world-class universities. Students need to get around 55% of the answers right in their Biology A-level in order to secure an A grade, grade boundaries for one exam board suggest. The A grade pass mark required for the reformed OCR advanced Biology A-level is 54.8%, the figures on its website show. Those wanting an A in the reformed maths exam would need to get 65.6% of the answers right. Meanwhile, students who sat the English language A-level would be looking for 77% of the marks in order to secure an A. I\u0027d advise anyone thinking about securing a place through clearing to take some time to visit universities and colleges in the next few days. This weekend\u0027s open days are listed on the Ucas website. Seeing everything in person can help you make the right decision. If you decide your next step isn\u0027t a degree though, information on apprenticeships, gap years and career options is also available on ucas. While many students hoping to go to a university or college of their choice will get the grades they need today, others will inevitably be left disappointed. But The Grand Tour presenter Jeremy Clarkson has told them not to worry. He tweeted: Don’t worry if your A level grades aren’t any good. I got a C and 2 Us. And I’m sitting here deciding which of my Range Rovers to use today. Earlier, Amanda Brown, deputy general secretary of the National Education Union, had argued that changes to A-Levels means that students are unable to fully demonstrate what they can do. Hundreds of thousands of teenagers have received their A-Levels today. Below, you can see the pass rate (students receiving A-E grades), broken down by nation and by region. (The figure in brackets is the change in percentage points on 2017) Nation England 97.6% (down 0.3) Wales 97.4% (down 0.3) Northern Ireland 98.2% (down 0.1) Region North-east England 98.2% (no change) North-west England 98.0% (down 0.2) Yorkshire \u0026amp Humber 97.7% (down 0.2) West Midlands 96.9% (down 0.5) East Midlands 97.6% (down 0.1) Eastern England 97.8% (down 0.1) South-west England 97.8% (down 0.1) South-east England 97.9% (down 0.1) London 97.0% (down 0.6) All 97.6% (down 0.3) Here are the rates for students receiving the top grades (A and A*)...

Coursework and other non-exam assessments are a better way for students to demonstrate their skills, are less of a memory test, and help lower attaining students and those with special educational needs and disabilities show their achievements. But Education Secretary Damian Hinds said the redesign of the qualifications would make them more appropriate, better (at) preparing young people for moving on to the next stage, including university. He told Today: Having exams at the end of the two years means that it is possible to consider the subject as a whole, to bring in all the different parts of it, to synthesise the different aspects of the subject in a way that is a little closer to undergraduate study.  A Department for Education spokeswoman said: We reformed A-levels after universities told us they were failing to prepare students for higher education. Reducing the number of exams students have to sit will give them more time for study and to gain a deeper understanding of the courses they are studying, an essential skill for undergraduate study.

Delroy Forrester was today found guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility but not guilty of her murder and will be sentenced on September 24.  Jasmine Forrester was battered to death with a table leg by her great-uncle who insisted the devil had to die after leaving her with near 100 injuries Forrester, 51, admitted killing the youngster hours after a hospital crisis team said it could not help him because he was not a risk, a jury heard. On Tuesday the court heard that Mr Forrester was suffering from a brain tumour. Wolverhampton Crown Court heard he had a tumour removed from his brain in 1999 but it had come back, reports the BBC.  Psychiatrist Dr Dinesh Maganty told the court that the tumour had taken over the rational part of his brain which meant he had no control over his actions. Dr Maganty said: Because the frontal lobe controls his inhibitions, he had a complete lack of control over his actions and emotions. There is clear evidence of a brain tumour. Clear evidence of epilepsy and psychosis. On Monday, the court heard how Forrester\u0027s daughter, Tyler Forrester, was angry her father was not in hospital and had called the crisis team at Penn Hospital in Wolverhampton hours before the incident to ask for help. The hospital is a major provider of mental health services.  After saying they could not assist her father, Ms Forrester said: You\u0027d better make sure he doesn\u0027t kill my nan tonight. Jurors at Wolverhampton Crown Court were told that Forrester had in fact wanted to kill his son Myles, and was later heard speaking of Jasmine as being pure and innocent. The jury heard that a few days before the incident Forrester had been suffering from a psychotic mental disorder. Police had been called to the house of the defendant\u0027s mother and Jasmine\u0027s great-grandmother, Victoria Forrester, in Kent Road, Wolverhampton, in the early hours after the 79-year-old raised the alarm with her neighbour. Forrester, formerly of Lower Villiers Street in Blakenhall, denied murdering Jasmine on the basis he was legally insane at the time of the killing. Opening the case against Forrester on Monday, prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC said: In the early hours of Friday February 9 2018, Jasmine was the subject of a frenzied and sustained attack by the defendant, in the course of which he used a broken table leg to inflict... catastrophic head injuries. The defendant does not dispute that he killed Jasmine in the way alleged.  However, he has pleaded not guilty to the allegation of murder on the basis that he was, in the legal sense, insane at the time he assaulted her and inflicted the fatal head injuries. Mr Rees continued: (Tyler) Forrester was angry that her father had not been taken to hospital and so she contacted the Crisis Team at Penn Hospital at 9.13pm (on February 8). They asked her if her father was at risk and she said \u0027No\u0027. They indicated that in those circumstances there was nothing they could do, in response to which she said in anger \u0027You\u0027d better make sure he doesn\u0027t kill my nan tonight\u0027. Speaking of Forrester\u0027s actions after the attack, Mr Rees said: While the defendant was being held (by officers) outside, he started singing phrases such as \u0027You are the Lord my God...\u0027. An officer asked whether the child was safe and the defendant responded by singing that the child wasn\u0027t safe and he was a bad man.  He added that \u0027the devil had to die, I kill her blud\u0027 and \u0027the devil is dead\u0027. Speaking of how Forrester felt after the incident, Mr Rees said: He stated he felt devastated by what he had done to Jasmine. He spoke of her being pure and innocent, and said that his son, Myles, had tricked him into thinking that Jasmine was the devil whereas, in fact, Myles was the devil. Giovanni D’Alessandro from the CPS said: “Jasmine was a friendly, caring and well-liked girl who had a bright future ahead of her. This was all taken away by Delroy Forrester.

The ex-Hollywood lighting director, 74, has told pals he expected Meghan , Samantha and Thomas Jr to help pay for his retirement but complained he had not received a “f***ing dime”. It comes after his ex-wife Doria Ragland was reportedly preparing to move to London to be close to her daughter, 37, and son-in-law Harry, 33. One source told the Daily Mirror: “While he was working, Tom supported all his children. He was generous.  “But he made no secret that he expected in his dotage the money he spent on them would be repaid. “He says they have not given him a f***ing dime back. He is growing increasingly bitter about it, and it has not been helped by how his ex-wife, Meghan’s mum, has been so welcomed into the royal fold. The fact she could be moving to England has not helped the situation while he is in a pokey home in Mexico.” Mr Markle has already revealed he had expected Meghan to look after him. He said: “I took care of my mother for the last five years of her life. “My daughter said she’d take care of me in my declining years. I’m not talking money, I’m talking about taking care of me. That’s important to me.”  However, the Duchess of Sussex and her dad have been estranged for three months. Matters came to a head when Mr Markle slammed the phone down on Harry during a heated phone call. The row came after Mr Markle was found to have lied to his soon-to-be \u0026shyson-in-law by denying colluding with a paparazzi to cash in on staged pictures days before the May 19 wedding. This was the latest in a stream of “dad disappointments” Meghan is said to have endured since she left home to go to university. However, we can reveal Mr Markle’s resentment over money is what initially drove a wedge between him and his children after he retired seven years ago. The Emmy winner, who worked on smash hit sitcom Married With Children, is said to have earned more than six figures each year during his career.  He also reportedly won $750,000 on the California State Lottery in 1990. Mr Markle gifted cash from the windfall to all his children while funding Meghan’s private education. After retiring, he moved from LA to Mexico, in part because of the cheaper lifestyle. Today he rents a $695-a-month – \u0026pound500 – home in Rosarito close to the US border. Despite cutting his costs, he declared himself bankrupt in California in 2016, with \u0026pound24,181 in credit card debts and savings of just \u0026pound160. Meanwhile, friends say Mr Markle is angry that Meghan’s mother has apparently been treated more favourably by the Royal Family than he has. Although the Prince has yet to meet his father-in-law, Doria has seen Harry on several occasions.  The 61-year-old yoga teacher has maintained a dignified silence since news of Meghan’s relationship with Harry emerged two years ago. Yet Mr Markle has publicly attacked his daughter and Doria is said to be furious his other children – Samantha, 53, and Thomas Jr, 51 – have “trashed” their half-sister. Sources say Meghan was also deeply hurt when she discovered her father had been cashing in on her \u0026shyrelationship by staging photos with paparazzi. That revelation was followed by Mr Markle pulling out of attending his daughter’s wedding, due to a heart attack.

Wills and Kate may also change their titles when Charles becomes king. Currently known as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the happy couple, both 36, could also gain two other royal titles. According to royal expert Marlene Koenig, the pair might inherit Charles\u0027 titles once he takes the throne. Speaking to HELLO!

The pair officially tied the knot on July 29 1981 at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral and the world watched the fairytale ceremony in awe.   Diana\u0027s look for her big day is one that has gone down in fashion history, with her large princess dress made of ivory silk taffeta inspiring brides across the planet.  But it\u0027s recently been revealed that the 20-year-old princess-to-be could have walked down the aisle in a very different outfit.   According to People , the designers of her wedding gown, David and Elizabeth Emanuel , had made a second wedding dress for Diana - and it was kept so heavily under wraps that even the bride didn\u0027t know it existed.  A lot of effort went in to keeping the dress out of the public eye before the big day, with the designers even going as far as to destroy their sketches straight after they\u0027d been shown to Diana. But in case the design for the original were to be leaked, another dress was created as a back-up option. At the time we wanted to make absolutely sure that the dress was a surprise, said David.  We didn’t try it on Diana. We never even discussed it. We wanted to make sure that we had something there it was for our own peace of mind, really. So Diana never even saw the second dress which was made from the same fabric as the first and also featured ruffles around the neck. However there were a few big differences between the two. The secret dress was a lot less lavish than the original version, lacking the antique lace and 10,000 mother-of-pearl sequins as well as the 25-foot train.

But while some did as well as you may think, others achieved just a handful of qualifications - and one particularly high profile royal achieved none. Despite having what has been described as an aptitude for learning, The Queen didn\u0027t have time for formal schooling, having to instead learn the constitutional monarchy ropes from a young age. In contrast, her children and grandchildren have enjoyed a more normal education - and varying degrees of success to show for it.   So how do the royals qualifications measure up? Prince William From 1990, William attended Ludgrove School in Berkshire for five years until he started at Eton College in 1995 where he took his GCSEs and A Levels. He left Eton in 2000 achieving an A in Geography B Art and C Biology. Like many students, The Duke of Cambridge chose to have a gap year before beginning his university course in order to travel and gain a variety of new experiences. He went on to gain a 2:1 degree in Geography at St Andrews University in Scotland, which is where he met his wife.  The Duchess of Cambridge Kate achieved 11 GCSEs at St. Andrew’s School in Pangbourne in 1995 and then went on to Marlborough College in Wiltshire, where she achieved As in Maths and Art, and a B in English. Leaving Marlborough College in July 2000, The Duchess of Cambridge undertook a gap year in which she studied at the British Institute in Florence, undertook a Raleigh International programme in Chile, and crewed on Round the World Challenge boats in the Solent. Kate graduated from St Andrews University in 2005 with a 2:1 in History of Art  Prince Harry Probably one of the least academic achievers is Prince Harry, who studied at Eton, gaining 11 GCSE\u0027s and a B in Art and D in Geography in his A Levels. On the royal\u0027s website it simply says: His Royal Highness went on to Eton College from September 1998 where he took his GCSEs and A Levels. On William\u0027s it outlines the three A Levels he took. Harry had plenty of successes though throughout his education and during his time at Eton, he was House Captain of Games and represented the school at rugby, cricket and polo, and was a member of the Combined Cadet Force.  He left in 2003 and joined the Army, but before doing so, he spent a year travelling to Australia, Argentina and Africa, where he made a documentary about the plight of orphans in Lesotho. The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle Meghan began her secondary education at Immaculate Heart High School in 1992 where she was known as a hard working and focused student. During her high school years, The Duchess of Sussex performed in theatrical productions at both Immaculate Heart and Loyola High School. Her former drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, who directed Meghan in seven plays, remembered that her former student sparkled.  She said: You see someone nice to the other kids, who gets good grades, doesn\u0027t say anything bad about anybody. America does not test students using GCSEs or A Levels, and it is has not been reported what Meghan got on her SATs (which is the test students take as an entry into university) but it is known that she got the grades she needed to get into university. She went on gain a double major in Theatre and International Relations at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in 2003. During her time at university, The Duchess completed an internship at the US Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she learned to speak Spanish. She also studied French for six years.  The Queen She\u0027s met politicians and film stars, speaks French fluently, loves to colour block and still rides a horse at 91 years of age, but the Queen has never sat an academic exam in her life meaning she hasn\u0027t a single GCSE or A Level (O Levels back then) to In her early childhood, the Queen was taught by a governess from 9.30am until 11am. Following the abdication of her uncle Edward VIII in 1938, Elizabeth needed to prepare herself for her future role and received lessons on constitutional history from the vice provost of Eton, Henry Marten. The Queen’s father had disliked school and her mother thought it was more important to have fun,’ Professor Kate Williams, author of Young Elizabeth told Good Housekeeping . Unlike her father, the Queen was and is very bright and had an appetite for learning as well as a razor sharp memory. The lack of a formal education didn\u0027t harm her as she\u0027s naturally analytical and something of an autodidact, as well as being hard working - which we know now is just as important as raw brainpower.    Prince Charles Prince Charles was educated at Gordonstoun where he achieved five O-levels (GCSEs) and two A-levels - a B in History and a C in French C. He then went on to Cambridge University where he achieved a 2:2 degree in History Legend has it his bodyguard who was present at all lectures with the young prince sat the exams too - and got a First. Princes Diana Princess Diana met with less success and failed all her O-levels, twice. However she apparently excelled in deportment, having attended finishing school in Switzerland.  Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, attended Benenden school in Kent where she gained six O-levels, and three A-levels in English, History and Politics. While Prince Andrew attended Gordonstoun like his older brother, his academic choices were much like Anne\u0027s - six O-levels and A-levels in English, History and Politics. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Prince Edward also went to Gordonstoun and has nine O-levels, three A-levels in English, History and Politics. He then gained a 2:2 degree in History from Cambridge University.

At the time, you just want everybody to like you. The money did bring problems with my family, and friends as well. It just became too much to cope with.

Warm and humid conditions are expected in parts of the country after days of cloudy and rainy weather brought a welcome break from extreme heat. Temperatures peaked at 35.3C in Faversham, Kent on July 26 as summer heat records fell across the country. Hot weather is set to return to the UK in the coming days and it could carry on into September, according to forecasts.  Until then, parts of Britain will see some miserable weather. Parts of northwest England and Scotland are braced for heavy downpours with up to 30mm of rain expected in some locations before the end of this week. But the chance of pressure building next week could bring a return to more pleasant, settled weather.    However, there is still a risk of showers or longer spells of rain further north - despite the improving picture. Fresh breezes are possible while the rain continues but there will be some respite, with occasional brighter and drier intervals likely, especially as the weekend progresses. In the south and east more dry weather will bring mainly brighter, sometimes sunny, periods. This could create some warm and humid conditions especially when the sun shines.

Beth Sturgis, 24, has been a carer for almost four years and says nothing gripes her more than when naivety leads people to believe all she does is wipe bums. Now Beth, from Plymouth, Devon, has written a letter to any nay-sayers and shared it online. The post has since gone viral, and Beth said she is overwhelmed and shocked with the reaction to her post, with around 5,000 views.  She wrote: Today I was a cleaner, a cook, a hand to hold, a friendly face, a washer, a dresser, a helper, a CARER today I was human. Today I helped a man that has lived through the war wash and dress because old age has now hit him and he is unable to walk or do these things for himself. His body is ageing faster than his mind, but he is still so positive and always has a smile on his face. Today I helped a lady who this time last year was living her life normally to complete her normal daily tasks. Because she is now living her life with a cruel disease that has taken over her body and left her unable to do these things for herself, and has confined her to a wheelchair. I saw the pain in her eyes, the \u0027why me?\u0027, the frustration behind her smile and her braveness and will to live through this. Today I administered medication to a lady living life with Alzheimer’s, medication that she doesn’t even know why she’s taking it.  Medication that I know and that she knows will not prevent the inevitable. Medication that will not prevent the fact that one day she may go from not remembering where she put something, to not remembering who her own family are. Medication that will not cure this horrible disease because one has not been found yet and it may never be found. Today I saw the fear in her eyes. Beth, who works for Bluebird Care, says that her job is in no way easy and that she becomes attached to those she cares for. I have attended funerals of those I have helped. Those who I have seen twice maybe even four times a day and I have cried at the loss of those lives Beth said. The impact that has on me is sometimes as sad as the loss of my own family, because it is hard to not become attached. There are days I come home and cry because of things I have to deal with, things that I cannot control and things that I cannot wave a magic wand and cure. But I do this job because I care. Nothing grips me more than when someone’s refers to careworkers as “glorified ass wipers” or their naivety leads them to believe that that is all we do. Yes I wipe asses, yes I deal with stuff that not everyone would want to but that is not all I do.

I get paid less an hour than someone who stacks shelves in a supermarket, does this annoy me? Yes. Would I go stack shelves? No. Because nothing beats the smile I put on someone’s face, the satisfaction you get from making a small difference to someone’s life, to help them live their lives as independently as they can, the feeling of purpose. No my job is not easy, there are days I come home and cry because of things I have to deal with, things that I cannot control and things that I cannot wave a magic wand and cure, and believe me I have a lot of those moments where I pray I could. I have hard days but I also have amazing days. I have attended funerals of those I have helped, those who I have seen twice maybe even four times a day and I have cried at the loss of those lives. The impact that has on me is sometimes as sad as the loss of my own family, because it is hard to not become attached. But I do this job because I CARE. So yes I may wipe asses, but that is not all I do. I am proud to be a carer and to work in this industry. So next time you think that that is all a being a Care worker means please think again. No I do not save lives, but I sure as hell make them easier for someone to live. To all you carers out there, I salute you. They may not remember my name but they will remember what difference I made to their lives and I will go to my grave knowing I did a job that helped others!

To all of you who have commented and shared I am sorry I haven’t been able to respond to each and everyone of you personally. Thank you for your lovely comments and thank you again to each and everyone of the carers out there for all you do. You make the world a better place!!! Remember that each and everyone of you make a difference in this world including those of you who work in a supermarket, no offence is meant here just a comparison in wages and area of work.

Lucas Gary Narkle dragged his girlfriend toward the oncoming train as she struggled to avoid being hurled onto the tracks at Elizabeth South station in Adelaide in October last year. The shocking incident was caught on camera at the station. Narkle, 19, faced the South Australian District Court on Wednesday, after earlier pleading guilty to endangering the girl\u0027s life. She was just 14 years old at the time.  The court heard Narkle\u0027s girlfriend was holding on for dear life as she was being dragged by him. She wasn\u0027t to know that he was going to stop, a prosecutor said regarding the incident. Narkle was originally charged with attempted murder and at the time was armed with a baseball bat, although both sides agreed it was not used. The 19-year-old was taken into custody following the incident and spent more than three months in prison until he was granted bail by the Supreme Court in February. Judge Simon Stretton said on Wednesday he was unlikely to impose further jail time on Narkle.  I have to bear in mind that his actual actions here are brief, irresponsible and didn\u0027t cause any physical harm at all, he said. I think nothing is going to be served by imposing a further term of actual imprisonment but I am strongly inclined towards an extended community service work. Narkle arrived more than 30 minutes late for the hearing, blaming public transport issues for the delay, reports Australian media. “Shout out to my boys in Yatala (Labour Prison),” was his only comment to reporters outside court. Narkle will return to court for sentencing on Thursday.

We knew it would be a good game, we know what Hibs are about, they are a very good team.“I enjoyed the way we played, some of the stuff in the first half was excellent but we know they have quality and put us under pressure. I’m pleased we stuck to our guns and we got what we deserved.”There was plenty to be happy about including an impressive display from winger Cammy Dow.Jimmy said: “Sam Jackson did great, he’s a confident big boy and I thought Cammy Dow was excellent – he’s a massive Dundee fan as well, which is great.”The second-round draw is tomorrow at 1pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united boss hopes slovakia international striker safranko can pave the way to championship glory","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United boss Csaba Laszlo expects new striker Pavol Safranko to help his side in their quest for promotion.The Tangerines picked up their first three points of the Championship season with the Slovakia cap grabbing what turned out to be the winning goal in a 2-1 victory at Queen of the South.Csaba knows all about the 23-year-old’s abilities and he was delighted with the start he’s made.Csaba said: “For this it was necessary to get a second striker.“We looked for a long time in the market and, like everyone else in the Championship, we don’t have millions to spend but we had to look to see who could help this team.“I know Pavol Safranko from the Slovakian national team and also from my time in Slovakia.“He turned just 23 and already has played two games for the Slovakian national team and has played for the U/21s.“I talked to Aalborg and they had three strikers, OK Safranko played already this season but I think at the end of the day it’s a good possibility to take him on loan.“He showed on Saturday he can keep the ball up front, he can score goals and is good in the air.“For the Scottish league you can not just be a striker, especially in this league, you must have a permanent presence in the air and permanent presence on the ground and he is a player who can improve us and be a very useful player.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/SNS-15266913-Dundee-United-v-Dunfermline.jpg-e1534240458997-820x564.jpg ","title":"el bakhtaoui speaks of frustration at not playing in right position at dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee’s Faissal El Bakhtaoui is convinced he can still make it in the Premiership but is happy to have the chance to prove himself all over again at Dunfermline.The Frenchman left Tayside for the Pars on a season-long loan after becoming increasingly frustrated with his lack of game-time at Dens Park.The 25-year-old scored eight times in 66 appearances for the Dark Blues after joining from Dunfermline in 2016 but failed to scale the heights he did with the Pars first time round.The striker insists his opportunities in the central striking role were all too rare under Neil McCann and this term was unlikely to be any better.Now the former futsal star, who joined Dunfermline as a complete unknown in 2012, is desperate to breathe new life into his career in familiar surroundings.Speaking ahead of last night\u0026#8217s Irn-Bru Cup clash away to Inverness Caley Thistle, he said: “I have come back a better player, with more experience. I learned so much in the Premiership, even though I was a bit frustrated at Dundee.“I think I can play at that level but it just didn’t happen for me.

It has been non-stop.“It was only five days and my first game so I need to know how my team-mates play.“I had four training sessions so it was a little bit crazy but it was good to help the team to win by scoring.“I’m happy with the start but the three points were the most important thing.“We have to start to win games but when I score it is always nice.“It was a good pass from Frederic Frans and I saw the goalkeeper went down so I just wanted to put it behind him and I think it was a good strike.“I think the first half was a good performance and we need to build on that.“The second half wasn’t perfect so we need to change something there.”Safranko joined the club on a year-long loan deal from Danish side Aalborg last week.He was well-known to manager Csaba Laszlo, though, as they worked together at Dunajska Streda (DAC) in Slovakia.There, Safranko knocked in six goals in 12 games after signing for the second half of the season as DAC went on an extended unbeaten run.And the chance to work with Csaba once more was a big draw for the striker once he heard Aalborg were happy to let him leave.He said: “I played under Csaba Laszlo in Slovakia at Dunajska Streda.“There we were unbeaten for 16 games in a row so I know what I can expect from him and I’m looking forward to playing for him again.“Csaba was the big part of why I joined Dundee United because I had a really good relationship with Csaba. I want to work for him.“I can honestly say that in Denmark there is a bit more combination football but here it is a little bit more fighting which will, hopefully, suit me better.“I can say every player dreams to play football in the United Kingdom so this was also one of the reasons I came here.”Safranko certainly knows the Scottish Championship is about “fighting” as he was given a welcome by the Queens backline.The makings of a black eye was clear in the Slovak’s face during and after the game as he battled with the Palmerston defenders.“I heard the Scottish league is quite hard – now I can feel it!” he added.“It is my style and how I play. We will see, I don’t want to speak too much because it was just my first game.”The Tangerines now have the best part of two weeks before their next Championship fixture – time Safranko thinks they can use to their advantage.“We will have time to train and I’m sure with this squad we can be much better in our next game.“The first half was our good phase because I had Nicky Clark close to me. He is a good player, and we can build on it.“Everyone fought and we have to continue with that because if just one person loses a battle, we will have problems.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b73f00fd264c.jpg ","title":"opening date revealed for dundee cctv control centre","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe date has been set for the new control centre to help tackle crime and antisocial behaviour to go live.The £750,000 Safety and Alarm Response Centre (SARC) will be a round-the-clock service to keep city residents safe.The base will allow Dundee City Council staff to respond to incidents more quickly by bringing footage from CCTV cameras – of which there are about 1,000 in the city – under one roof.It will also respond to the council’s 6,000 residents who are supported by the community alarm service.The centre, which will be housed at the West District Housing Office in Sinclair Street in Lochee, will also allow information to be passed between other agencies, including police, ambulance and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.The aim is to get to incidents more quickly, and in particular, alarm systems at sheltered housing complexes will be linked up to the SARC, allowing council officials and blue light services to respond faster.A tender of £86,056 for equipment including operator consoles and screens is set to be rubber-stamped by councillors at Monday’s policy and resources committee meeting.The building work is scheduled to be completed this month and the new consoles and screens to be fitted by October 19.The SARC is then scheduled to be fully operational on December 1.Key city sites such as the McManus Galleries, Dundee House and the V\u0026ampA – which opens next month – will be heavily monitored by existing CCTV cameras to avoid having them maliciously damaged.Graeme Mackenzie, service manager of community safety and resilience for the council said the “preservation of assets” such as these buildings was a priority for the local authority, as petty, malicious damage would have a “huge impact on resources”.The council received European Regional Development Fund funding for the SARC project which will part fund an upgrade to the city’s public space CCTV system.Council leader John Alexander said: “This will mean we have the technology and capability to do far more than we did before.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"plans for park for folk to exercise and relax at site of former dundee school stepped up","story":"\t\t\t\t\tProposals to create a “community park” in the grounds of the former Douglas Primary School are set to take a step forward.City councillors are to be asked next week to agree to the council joining forces with a local group to help make the park plan a reality.In a report to the neighbourhood services committee, Elaine Zwirlein, director of neighbourhood services, has recommended that an application by Douglas Community Spaces Group should be approved.Her report states: “It is recommended that approval is given for Dundee City Council to enter into a partnership agreement with Douglas Community Spaces Group (DCSG).“DCSG was established to develop and deliver a community park to provide a new landscaped space for the whole community to come together, grow, play, exercise and relax.“The community’s long-term hope is that the success of the park will instigate a process of improvement of further green spaces throughout Douglas by raising the aspiration, knowledge, skills, support and resources of local people.“Neighbourhood services’ landscape design team has been working with DCSG to develop proposals and has, on its behalf, submitted a stage one application for the development of the former Douglas Primary School ground to create Douglas Community Park.”The report said the site was an appropriate place for the park, having been used for community gala days for many years and being centrally located next to Douglas Community Centre.Further development work, supported by the Big Lottery and the council, would result in the next stage application being submitted on behalf of DCSG, it added.Margaret Hogg, chairwoman of Douglas Community Centre local management group, said the latest development was a welcome step for residents.She added: “This is definitely good news.

Tennis development is best provided through the schools.”The tennis courts opened in the 1920s, and were formerly know as Craigielea, before merging with the Stobsmuir club in the late 1990s to become Craigmuir Tennis Club.The club is understood to have tried a number of open days and advertising to attract more people but failed to draw in new members.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.702448.jpg ","title":"substance use recovery session to be held in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA substance use, stigma and supporting recovery awareness session is to take place in Dundee.The event is a part of the Recovery Friendly Dundee initiative which aims to tackle stigma surrounding misuse as well as raise awareness of the links between health inequalities and substance misuse.The session will run at Menzieshill Community Centre on Monday September 17 and is aimed at service providers.Tailored sessions to local community groups and volunteers are also available.

That cannot happen now as the transfer window in England for signing players closed last Thursday.Aberdonian Shinnie made his Scotland debut when coming on as a substitute in a 2-0 loss away to Peru in a friendly this summer.The versatile midfielder/ left-back then started for the Scots in the 1-0 defeat to Mexico at the Azcteca stadium a few days later.Shinnie arrived at Pittodrie in summer 2015 on a three-year deal straight after leading Inverness Caley Thistle to Scottish Cup glory as captain.He signed a three-year contract until summer 2018.McInnes has already persuaded Shinnie to sign a new contract as he penned a one-year extension until 2019 in January last year.He hopes Shinnie does the same again.Shinnie underlined his versatility at the weekend by dropping from midfield into the left-back role in the 1-0 win at Dundee as the Dons were hit by a defensive crisis.McInnes had four senior defenders sidelined through injury or suspension.Right-back Shaleum Logan was suspended and will also miss out on Saturday’s League Cup clash with St Mirren at Pittodrie.On-loan Watford defender Tommie Hoban is out with a knee injury and Scotland international centre-back Scott McKenna is sidelined for six weeks with a hamstring tear sustained in the 1-1 Premiership season opener against Rangers.Centre-back Mark Reynolds is out for the next six months having undergone knee surgery.McInnes said: “Given all our injury problems, defensively especially, to go away from home and get a clean sheet was brilliant.“I was really pleased with that side of it as we defended well at Dundee.”McInnes had initially targeted signing a defender to provide cover but accepts the need for that is not so urgent now.He said: “Shay has one more game to miss and then he will be back for HIbs.“Hopefully Tommie Hoban will be back in two or three weeks and Scott will be back after the international break.“So defensively we will not be too bad then and in a few weeks’ time that will be healthier.“And plus there are restrictions – you can’t always go and get another player.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"what do you get inside scotlands baby box1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEvery newborn baby in Scotland in entitled to receive a free baby box.Each box, featuring a design by Leanne Young, contains a selection of clothes \u0026#8211 from newborn to six month \u0026#8211 as well as vital everyday items, including travel changing mat, a bib and a bath towel.They even include a poem, a couple of books, a bath/room thermometer and a digital ear thermometer.The box itself even doubles a first bed for your baby \u0026#8211 coming with a mattress, protector, fitted sheet and a blanket.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen based firm faroe oppose dno bid to take control of its business","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFaroe Petroleum said it is “very concerned” by actions from Norway’s DNO to “take control of its business”.DNO has requested seats on the Aberdeen-headquartered firm’s board for its executive chairman Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani and managing director Bjorn Dale.In a statement, Faroe said it believes the move is “wholly self-serving and part of an undisclosed strategy on DNO and Mr. Mossavar-Rahmani’s part to try and gain control of Faroe’s business without making an offer to all shareholders at an appropriate premium”.In April, DNO acquired a 28.7% stake in Faroe, which is a UK and Norway-focussed explorer.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen bypass cycle event a kick in the teeth say cyclists","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCyclists have described an opening event for the AWPR as a “kick in the face”.The GoNorthEast Road Festival will allow cyclists a chance to try out the new road before it opens – but a group representing them has been told they will not be allowed to use their own bikes.The event is due to be held on September 8 and 9 on the bypass close to the River Dee.

But it’s been great for her to spend time with her little sister, and she’s happy to have them back.”The youngster was given the prognosis of spastic diplegic cerebral palsy at the age of 14 months – the neurological condition causes constant stiffness and tightness of leg and arm muscles, making mobility difficult.The family had previously thought treatment in the US was the only option and had set about raising £70,000 when they received the good news that Olivia had been deemed an ideal candidate for the operation in Bristol.Olivia is currently gearing up to go back to school next Tuesday.Senga hopes that she’ll be ready to go back with her classmates, and says they’ll “play it by ear” for the first few weeks.She said: “We’ll just need to see how she gets on, and if she needs to reduce her time at school then that’s what we’ll do.”Senga hopes that the surgery will now make Olivia able to do things that her friends and classmates can.She said: “So much has changed for her, she can sit on a bench now, she can sit crossed legged, it doesn’t sound like a big thing, but it is for her.“It’s little steps, and it’s good for her that she can be part of that.“I know that sitting on a bench isn’t a big thing, but her sitting with her classmates is a big thing for her.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b752334e0906-884x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen sandwich shop cleans up with glowing report","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen sandwich shop that was criticised by inspectors earlier this year has now been given a glowing report.Aberdeen City Council sent an inspector for a routine check of Deja Vu food shop on Rose Street in March and their report said improvement was needed.The inspector expressed concern about the condition of some of the equipment and cleanliness.Several insects were spotted in the back kitchen area, which is not used for food preparation.The business’s owner, Roy Duncan, said he immediately called in pest controllers and the insects were removed within hours.He added that he spoke with the council inspectors in depth so he was able to attend to their concerns.According to the council, the premises was re-inspected on June 8 and they gave it a pass rating – meaning that all the original concerns had been dealt with.Mr Duncan, who has been in the food trade for 30 years, said: “It was quite a shock because, having been in the trade for so long, I had always passed these inspections and known exactly what gets you a pass and what doesn’t. I was surprised.“I also disagreed with what the council said. They made out there were a lot of insects in the kitchen where we make food, but it was two insects in a back room.“They would have come in during a food delivery and it was an isolated incident – one we sorted out right away.”Mr Duncan said he was delighted to have passed the latest inspection and was looking forward to getting things back on track.“It was a bit of a setback, but we’re pleased it’s behind us now.“Our food tastes great and we have a wide range of dishes for people to sample.“I have a great team of staff and we love our customers calling in.“I hope that more people will come in over the coming days and weeks to see what we have to offer.”Mr Duncan added: “I am proud to run the business and always welcome customer feedback.“We pride ourselves on offering delicious food people want.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"baby boxes first birthday","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAlmost 6,000 baby boxes have been received by new parents in the north-east.As the Baby Box initiative celebrates its first birthday this week, new figures have shown that 5,932 families across the NHS Grampian area have had boxes delivered to them in the past year.The number of boxes received in the area ranks third in the country, behind NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Lothian.What do you get inside Scotland\u0026#8217s baby box?A Scottish Government scheme, it includes a number of essential items for parents and babies, while the box itself can be used as a safe sleeping place.Children and early years minister Maree Todd said: “A year on from when the first Baby Boxes were delivered, we can say these boxes are having a real impact on the lives of those who receive them.“These boxes demonstrate that, as a society, we value each and every child in Scotland.

They are the tickets many of us have to buy in order to get to work.”Mr Chambers said: “We wrote to the prime minister in June outlining what passengers had been telling us about their nightmare journeys to work that were happening day after day.“The response we got in July suggests no end in sight to the reduced services on many lines subject to interim emergency timetables.“We’ve also learned further timetable improvements in December this year have been postponed indefinitely.”Transport Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said passengers would be “amazed” at the increase.He added: “A fares freeze would benefit all passengers, begin the process of re-building trust and start to bring passengers back to a railway they can rely on.“We know 30% of rail commuters are satisfied with the value for money of their ticket.“Despite substantial investment in new trains and track, many passengers have yet to experience a more reliable railway with accurate information, less disruption and better value for money.”ScotRail and GNER, which run rail services through Aberdeen and the north-east, are represented by the Rail Delivery Group, whose spokesman said most ticket income is spent on maintaining the rail network.“For every pound spent on fares, 98p goes back into running and improving the railway,” said the spokesman.“Thanks to income from fares, as well as the private sector and the taxpayer, the rail industry is seeing the highest level of investment in a generation, changing and improving the railway.“Seventy brand new ScotRail trains were introduced on key routes across Scotland in autumn 2017 with free wifi in all carriages.”A UK Department for Transport spokesman said: “This is the sixth year in a row where this government will cap regulated fares in line with inflation.”The Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said: “We recognise fares increases are unwelcome.

According to the report by Aberdeenshire Council’s environmental health manager, work to ban all dogs from these areas would take an estimated two years.The report indicates the blanket ban “is likely to meet some resistance from the public”.It says the measure could be seen as “unfair on responsible owners that may visit playparks” and “extremely difficult to manage, implement and enforce”.Ms Davidson brought the issue before the council amid fears that dog waste could have a detrimental effect on the health of children.She said: “At the moment, the council doesn’t have a proper policy. So what I’m really looking for, is for the council to have a policy that can be implemented over time, it doesn’t have to be overnight.“It’s hard to enforce it, but if it’s clear what the council’s policy is, then it’s much easier to challenge people going against the policy.“I’m not sure why it would cost so much, I’m not asking for fences to be erected that aren’t already there. I’m asking for a bit of respect for these areas that children use extensively, and should be dog free.”As part of the first option listed in the report, “problem areas” would be identified, with the erection of signs alongside a public campaign and the stepping up of patrols in the area by dog wardens.Option two calls for signage to be erected at all locations, which would take 18 months, while option three calls for fences to be erected alongside the signs.Option four would allow for dogs to be kept on leads in the concerned areas, and option six would keep the current policies in place.The implementation of option one would be possible with current staffing levels, and the cost would be identified when problem sites are assessed.The report will be put before area committees in the coming weeks, with each being asked to make a recommendation to the council’s infrastructure services committee.Scottish SPCA chief superintendent Mike Flynn said: “We would support a decision to prevent dogs from being exercised in school grounds or play parks.“Dog faeces can carry dangerous toxins which can cause infection if children come into contact with it.“This proposal would encourage responsible dog ownership and will motivate people to exercise their dogs away from playgrounds.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"huntly eye cup run as they see off the broch","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHuntly caretaker manager Martin Skinner believes they can go all the way in the Evening Express Aberdeenshire Cup after winning their first-round tie.A double from Matthew McDonald gave the Black and Golds a 2-1 win against Fraserburgh at Bellslea to set up a second round tie with Deveronvale.Skinner, who has been in temporary charge since Charlie Charlesworth’s resignation just over a fortnight ago, believes the Strathbogie side can have a good run in the Shire Cup.He said: “I’m delighted for the boys because they put in a hell of a shift.“It’s a tough place to come on a Wednesday night but we dug in well.“A cup run is there for us, we’re through the first round so we’ll apply ourselves fully to every cup game and hopefully we can win it.”Skinner also praised goal-hero McDonald and added: “Matthew missed two easier chances but he took his goals well.“He works hard for you and creates chances, he’s been struggling for goals so it’s good for him to get going.”Skinner has admitted he would be keen to manage Huntly on a permanent basis as Charlesworth’s successor.He said: “I don’t know (about his chances).

As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre scores with support from ardrishaig community trust","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIn a fantastic boost for youth football in Mid Argyll, the Ardrishaig Community Trust and Lochgilphead Soccer Centre have jointly announce that Ardrishaig Community Trust will be the main sponsor of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre for the next three years.The funding package, worth £5,000 for each of the next three years, will make a huge contribution to the centre’s ambitious development plans – it already has more than 120 members, including around 40 from Ardrishaig.The development plan will see the Soccer Centre invest in new equipment, quality coaching to help the youngsters develop their football skills, participation in football festivals, and attend Scotland games, among other things.The funding will meet the cost of around 100 new football strips, all branded with Ardrishaig Community Trust, and will help ensure all Lochgilphead Red Star YFC teams are kitted out the same, from primary one to sevens (including the girls’ teams).The cost of kit to keep the coaches – who contribute the equivalent of around £15,000 a year in time – warm and dry throughout the year, will be part funded by the sponsorship. The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities. In front of the parade was musician Pat Kenny playing haunting tones on a carnyx, an Iron Age Celtic war horn.On the green there were stands selling everything from soap to artwork and woolly bunnets to garden shrubs.As well as battle re-enactments and weapons demonstrations there were living history demonstrations and workshops where adults and children tried their hand at traditional crafts such as spinning, weaving, metalworking, woodwork, dressing up and blowing the carnyx.Children took part in the Lughnasa Games, featuring various tests of Celtic warrior skills.Brian MacLennan of Lochgilphead Community Council said: \u0026#8216The day was a massive success and I\u0026#8217ve had lots of positive feedback.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man. Greta Cameron talked about the early years of the Oyster Bar, established on the estate in the late 1970s by Christina\u0026#8217s brother Johnny Noble along with fish farmer Andy Lane.Piecing together records from her father\u0026#8217s journal, estate records and blending these with the recollections of the people of the estate, Christina has created a remarkable piece of work.This book is not just about the Nobles, but the Ardkinglas community, the people who make it and have made it and the story of how they lived and worked.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m very pleased that so many people have come along today for our launch party,\u0026#8217 said Christina.\u0026#8216Ardkinglas is a place that is very dear to me, and the place and the people have contributed to making me who I am today.

We look forward to VisitScotland accepting our proposals and working with us to ensure a smooth transfer of the facility over the coming weeks.\u0026#8216A lot of work will need to be carried out before the transfer and anyone wishing to volunteer should get in touch through our website.\u0026#8217A VisitScotland spokesman said: \u0026#8216We are currently in discussions with Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust about proposals for future use of the property and have the support of the local community.\u0026#8217Tarbert businessman Ian Macintyre believes the transfer of the premises should be a formality. He told the Advertiser: \u0026#8216In the original constitution for the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islay tourist board, the last paragraph is that in the event of this situation, any assets should transferred to an appropriate local body. I think that should still hold.\u0026#8217The trust\u0026#8217s asset transfer plan is backed by Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, who said: \u0026#8216I made it clear when this plan was first announced that there would have to be alternatives in place before any closure. That remains my position and I am concerned that, for example, there is still no fast mobile phone speeds and broadband in some parts of the area which are necessary to get information from the developing providers.\u0026#8216I have been supporting the proposal from the community trust for the Tarbert premises and I am hopeful that there can be an asset transfer, not least because it seems that the building was only given to VisitScotland on the understanding that if it stopped using it, it would revert to another body doing the same sort of work.\u0026#8217Councillor Alastair Redman added: \u0026#8216I would support the Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust in their talks to ask for an asset handover and take over the tourist centre building.\u0026#8217VisitScotland states that tourist information provision will continue across Argyll and Bute through a network of more than 130 VisitScotland Information Partners (VIPs) primarily based in hotels and guest houses, with three of these in Tarbert, four in Campbeltown and two in Inveraray, alongside \u0026#8216outreach\u0026#8217 staff attending events around the country.\u0026#8216It’s going to be a big miss in the village. I don’t know what they’re trying to do to small places.\u0026#8217 Flora Shaw, Earra Gael gift shop.\u0026#8216It’s terrible, because we get people coming in here asking us for information.

It\u0026#8217s mad even if it was just simply for the limited hours in October but we definitely need something in the summer months.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m not happy about it. They are a mine of information and when it closes I don’t know what we\u0026#8217ll do because our internet signal is so sketchy around here.\u0026#8217 Christine Entwistle, Harbour Gallery.\u0026#8216I think it’s a great pity.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure.

And he is well aware that Labour must recapture votes in places like the Doon Valley if it is to regain power at Holyrood and Westminster. “This is precisely the kind of constituency we need to win back,” admitted the Scottish Labour Party leader. He made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank. But time will tell whether or not this will bring voters back to the fold. Mr Leonard chatted amiably to lady volunteers at the Kirk Shop, in the middle of Dalmellington. There was clearly lots of goodwill for the Yorkshire-born politician. The affable Labour leader then moved on to Dalmellington Care Centre, where he planted a red rose to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. “My grandfather was a gardener, back in Leeds,” said Mr Leonard, as he wielded a spade. He heard about grassrooots co-operation in Dalmellinton among groups like The Zone and the care centre.  Mr Leonard said: “It’s the resilience of the people that’s keeping the Doon Valley going. “But it’s about time they were given a helping hand from government. “There are too many people living in poverty and on poverty pay. “We need investment in public services and we need to see communities having more control, with the possibility of community buy-outs.” Mr Leonard said only Labour is pledging a decade of investment. “We’re the only party opposing the austerity policies of the Tories, which are being passed on by the SNP.” He said the SNP’s own Growth Commission report revealed there would be even more austerity in an independent Scotland. And he was adamant: “The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to a second referendum on independence.”  Labour colleague Colin Smyth MSP said: “We’re seeing a growing frustration among voters on a debate focused on the constitution. “People want to see improvements in education and health.” Mr Leonard popped up to Bellsbank to see how streets are being transformed with ‘Balamory’ style painting of houses.

Organisers posted the following message on Facebook: \"Firstly, we would like to thank the thousands who attended The Big Cheese Festival today and who congaed their way around the Main Stage Tent, creating that incredible Festival Atmosphere.  \"We would like to express our sympathy toward some of our amazing cheese and cheesey Street Food Traders who were traveling to the city from across the country, and who due to adverse weather conditions and impassable roads, were unfortunately forced to abort their journeys today.  \"Sadly due to this, a few compromises had to be made and we are disappointed that a larger variety of cheese wasn\u0026rsquot available.  \"Despite this, our cheese traders who were able to attend showed amazing dedication throughout the event, and did not fail to deliver, with food available right to the end.  \"We would like to offer everyone who purchased a ticket 50 per cent discount to next years event.  \"All feedback will be taken on board, please email info@thebigcheesefestival.\"  Did you attend the festival?

And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

Mr Ramsay, who is from West Yorkshire, told the Courier: \"I think it is a disgrace that East Lothian has no contingency plan for shipwrecks despite being a fishing community.  \"I have been threatened and abused while staying at the beach at Prestonpans with my boat and when I managed to float it and asked for permission to move to Cockenzie Harbour I was refused by the MCA.  \"I\u0027ve lost everything, this was my home and I invested everything in it.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do?

Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.

It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8195899.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial. Its \u0026lsquolife expectancy\u0026rsquo is approximately 50 years."},{"url":null,"title":"famous-old-east-lothian-football-club-revived","story":"  The newly revived Wallyford Bluebell football team has already won the John Whyte Memorial Trophy, awarded to the champions of the five-a-side tournament hosted by Musselburgh Athletic Football Club at Olive Bank during the Musselburgh Festival.

Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.  Land was previously earmarked for a new doctors\u0026rsquo surgery to be created on the site of the new East Lothian Community Hospital, which is currently being built on the site of the former Roodlands Hospital.  The new hospital is expected to be complete in 2020 but no planning application has been submitted for a GP surgery at any site in the town, including the hospital and within the new Letham Mains development, which is sandwiched between the B6471 and the A6093.  Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.

Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.

Sentencing him at Westminster Magistrates\u0026rsquo Court on Thursday, Jane Smith said: \u0026ldquoIt is a serious offence. You were uploading the images on to a website. You were recording them and there were several victims.  Sivier, of Warren Road, Cambridge, admitted at a hearing earlier this month outraging public decency.  The charge stated that on June 20 at Horse Guards Parade in London he had used a camera while walking along to film under females\u0026rsquo skirts.  At around noon on the day of the incident he was seen by police at the end of the Mall nearest to Buckingham Palace with a camera bag dangling near his ankles.  The lens of the camera was poking out and pointing upwards, prosecutor Trevor Green told the court, while the rest of the camera was zipped away in the bag.  Police saw him \u0026ldquoup close behind a woman at that point and followed him as he made his way towards St James\u0026rsquo Park where he was seen filming up another woman\u0026rsquos dress.

At an employment tribunal in Aberdeen in June the 49-year-old Canadian national said she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards, claiming she was targeted with sexual harassment and for being a woman, as well as over her age.  The abuse was said to have taken place between 2015 and 2017 while she was based in the government body\u0027s Scrabster office in the Highlands and continued after she was signed off.  In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick alleged she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.  However it is understood the tribunal was unable to consider that allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.  The employment tribunal ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.  In its judgment the tribunal said it could not agree whether the cards could be said to have been likely to come from current colleagues.  In a statement the Fitzpatrick family said: \"The Fitzpatrick family are hugely disappointed with the result of the Tribunal.\"  However they said the decision was \"not unexpected\" as the alleged restraint incident could not be taken into account.

Mr Mustafa as targeted by Muslims in Glasgow and had to seek police protection after he spoke out about the more restrictive practices of Islam being propagated by Mosques.  In response, he says that 15 imams issued the fatwa\u0026nbsp - or ruling - calling for other Muslims to take action against him.  He has since been threatened with beheading by extremists after he claimed fasting between dawn and sunset during the month of Ramadan is not a requirement in the Quran, and has sought the protection of the police.    Paigham Mustafa  The father of three, said that many Muslims were being taught \"cultural\" lessons which strayed from the true meaning of Islam.  He believes the community has allowed itself to become isolated and backwards-looking, and has called on his fellow Muslims to be more open to Western values.  Mr Mustafa who spent several years writing his book \u0027The Quran: God\u0026rsquos Message to Mankind\u0027, said: \u0026ldquoIt is high time that British Muslims become pro-active instead of reactive. The murders and mayhem perpetrated by misguided Muslim militants in the UK, and the continuing radicalisation of disaffected Muslim youth makes this a topmost priority.  \u0026ldquoLogic, rationalism and pluralism must become the true hallmarks of British Islam to replace blind ritualism, outdated tribalism and a religious zealotry that are all predicated upon a largely anachronistic foreign-infused belief system.  The new organisation, named the Oxford Institute for British Islam (OIBI) says that it will \"not be beholden\" to medieval theological interpretations, misogynistic patriarchal biases, archaic political baggage, outmoded cultural norms, irrelevant tribal customs or bygone practices from \"distant ancestral homelands\".

Work is being undertaken to secure funding from UK donors, and OIBI will officially launch in early 2019 from premises in Oxford.  It is intended to be an educational unit and research foundation which will address the secular needs and spiritual concerns of British Muslims, combining the worlds of religion, politics, society and philosophy.  OIBI\u0026rsquos goal is to become the chief catalyst for developing fresh intellectual rigour as well as championing positive socio-political and religious momentum within the British Muslim community.  The plan is to establish an independent publishing arm to distribute research output, and launch a new Journal of British Islam, which will print original articles and provocative submissions from across the religious, philosophical and political divide.    Mr Mustafa has criticised \"cultural\" practices for influencing Islam  \u0026ldquoMuslim social self-exclusion has become a largely voluntary phenomenon within the UK.

Of course there has been criticism from some corners that the Education Bill should have been introduced to Parliament. Equally there has been a lot said about whether legislation was ever necessary to achieve the change we want to see within the education system.  There will always be differing views on how best to improve attainment and ensure all of Scotland\u0026rsquos young people are given an equal opportunity to excel. The one thing we are all in agreement over is that we must do everything within our power to ensure our education system is the best it possibly can be.  So let me make the position absolutely clear.  This government\u0026rsquos number one priority remains education. My focus for the new term will be improving attainment and ensuring excellence and equity for all, as it has been since I took up post.  You may not agree with how I choose to achieve this, but you cannot accuse me of trying to do any less.  Legislation to help implement reform would be extremely useful and is a valid route to pursue. It would set out clear, and consistent standards for every local authority in Scotland and make it a legal requirement for these to be met.  I am not entirely dismissing this option. If sufficient progress is not made throughout the next year I will return to Parliament with the Education Bill and introduce it.  But this isn\u0026rsquot about party politicking and political point scoring. This is about doing what is right for Scotland\u0026rsquos schools.  I have been listening to many voices throughout this debate and the clear message I have received is that those working on the frontline believe they can achieve the same results faster, with fewer distractions. Anyone with a genuine interest in delivering the best possible outcomes for our young people should surely welcome this approach.  Recently there have been questions raised about the next steps for education reform. Let me give the reassurance that work to progress reform has never stopped.  We have been working closely with local government throughout the summer to take forward the changes that will improve our education system.  More control for schools, teachers and parents is on the way. Our Regional Improvement Collaboratives \u0026ndash groups created to share expertise and best practice at a local level \u0026ndash are already established with further detailed plans due to be published soon.  An independent panel on career pathways for teachers has already been set up. I want our teachers to know there will be exciting and challenging opportunities to enrich their career. Good news for teachers and good news for our learners who will benefit from enhanced expertise and experience.  A comprehensive action plan for parental involvement will be published next week and the new Scottish Learner Panel, enabling young people to help shape national education policy, will begin its work in the Autumn.  Reform is already gathering pace.  Whether we go down a legislative route or not our focus for the new term remains resolute.  This has been billed as the best chance in a generation to make radical improvements to our schools. I am committed to this challenge and I believe our education system is too."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-to-run-pilot-scheme-for-european-4am-drinks-licences","story":"  In a move that would rival the liberal drinking rules of Barcelona and Berlin, the city is considering adopting a more European approach to alcohol consumption in a bid to avoid binging at closing time.  Under the plans, 16 and 17-year-olds would also be allowed to remain in licensed premises until 11pm, which could benefit teenagers attending gigs in the city centre and eating out with family.  Speaking about the plan, chairman of Glasgow Licensing Board Cllr Matt Kerr said: \u0026ldquoBy potentially granting licences until 4am while demanding the highest possible standards from licence holders we are striking the right balance between the licence trade and the needs of the wider community.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a strong view that a more European approach would avoid the rush to consume alcohol before closing time that then spills out on to our city centre streets.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos very important to stress that this is still a proposal and that in any event, 4am closing would still be the subject a pilot programme that will draw in evidence from the likes of the police and the health service.  Club owners insist current drinking hours are \u0026ldquorestrictive and, according to Garage boss Donald Macleod, Glasgow should be free to compete with other European cities.  \u0026ldquoI think this approach is very progressive,\" said Mr Macleod, who is also convenor of Glasgow Licensing Forum. \"It\u0026rsquos about getting a balance, to keep the city open for those who demonstrate the standards.  \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos the point of having platinum status for Best Bar None if you aren\u0026rsquot rewarded for it.  Stuart Patrick, chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, said the city\u0027s night time economy \u0026ndash which already generates \u0026pound2.6 billion per year and supports some 16,600 jobs \u0026ndash would enjoy a shot in the arm if the plan is green lit.  \u0026ldquoOperating in a similar way to our European counterparts by adding an hour extra to opening times of pubs, bars and clubs across the city opens avenues for increased success within the industry,\" he said.  \u0026ldquoWe are fully in support of any developments that reiterates the overall aims of Glasgow\u0026rsquos economic strategy and we will work closely with our members within the sector to optimise the proposed new license within the city.  Under the plans, which have been put out for consultation, venues would be considered for the later hours if the licence holder can prove they have prioritised public safety, securing gold status or above in the Best Bar None scheme.  Paul Waterson, of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association said later opening hours was \"not the way to go\".  \u0026ldquoThere used to be three separate licenses, there was one for restaurants, one for pubs and one for clubs,\" he said.  \u0026ldquoUnder the new act there was just one licence and the differentials have been eroded. Consequently we have got ourselves into a right mess in terms of what a pub is and what\u0026rsquos a club. We don\u0026rsquot see why places should be open until 4am. We would rather keep the disciplines between the three types of venue because they ran completely differently.\"  Off-sales could also face added scrutiny for license applications if they are located in areas of the city where there are found to be high levels of alcohol-related crime or health problems.  A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: \u0026ldquoThis is one of many proposals out for consultation in the board\u0026rsquos draft policy statement and we will be liaising with policy makers to formulate our response."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-once-again-the-uk-is-being-sucked-into-the-quagmire-of-afghanistan","story":"  It was near there back in the mid 1980\u0026rsquos at the height of the Soviet war in the country, that I narrowly escaped capture by Russian troops before finally slipping back across the border into the safety of neighbouring Pakistan.  Wracked with dysentery and in the company of a wounded Australian photographer colleague whose radial nerve had been severed by shrapnel, we had lain on the floor of a battered bus crammed with dead and wounded Afghan guerrilla fighters for five days as it crawled across desert plains and hills towards the Pakistan frontier.  It was only near Ghazni that to our great relief, we at last managed to give our Russian pursuers the slip before making it out of Afghanistan.  Ghazni\u0026rsquos strategic position has always been important in Afghanistan\u0026rsquos seemingly interminable wars. Its proximity to Kabul and location on the major highway connecting the capital to the south makes it a vital lifeline.  It\u0026rsquos for precisely this reason that over the past week, this city of some 280,000 people has found itself at the centre of a fierce battle as Taliban insurgents sought to capture it.  It was last Friday when more than 1,000 Taliban fighters stormed the city in a predawn assault. Reports indicate that a number of foreign fighters aided the Taliban in their offensive, among them Pakistani and Chechen jihadists and even some al-Qaeda affiliates.  For a while it was touch and go with the Taliban gaining control of much of Ghazni before Afghan Army troops backed by US forces retook the embattled city on Tuesday. This though is far from being an isolated incident.  No sooner had the security forces reasserted their control over Ghazni, than the Taliban in the past few days have again attacked and seized large parts of an army base in the northern province of Faryab, killing at least 10 soldiers and capturing dozens of others.  The latest violence not only raises questions over much mooted peace talks with the Taliban but also casts a shadow over Afghanistan\u0026rsquos upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for October 20.  It\u0026rsquos against this volatile backdrop too that Britain this week deployed another four hundred and forty troops, effectively almost doubling its \u0026lsquoboots on the ground\u0026rsquo to a total of 1,090 military personnel.  It\u0026rsquos now four years since British troops \u0026lsquodeparted\u0026rsquo from Afghanistan. During those 13 years of fighting hundreds of British lives were lost while some \u0026pound40bn was spent trying to tame the Taliban.  During my time embedded as a correspondent within both British and American units, I watched as the consummate professionalism of those troops on the ground was slowly eroded by the stark realisation that this was a war that was unwinnable.  The new plan now the politicians duly told us was that Nato would formally end its retaliation for Afghanistan harbouring Osama bin Laden. It would withdraw its forces and leave the Afghan government and its military along with continued \u0026lsquoadvisory\u0026rsquo support to deal with the Taliban itself. Cue the UK\u0026rsquos latest troop deployment which we are told, will involve little more than ferrying international advisors safely around the country\u0027s capital city, Kabul, in their Foxhound vehicles hence giving rise to them being dubbed \u0026ldquoArmoured Uber.  But all these \u0026lsquojolly japes\u0026rsquo aside, the reality remains that the Taliban is in the ascendancy, and any support role undertaken by UK troops still puts them in harms way. That we have all been here before and seemingly learned nothing beggars belief. As does the fact that the UK government\u0026rsquos agreement to deploy more troops is almost certainly done to assuage US President Donald Trump after his Nato visit last month.  Mr Trump, a president who promised to bring US troops home from foreign campaigns is now faced with the harsh reality of a re-galvanised Taliban, and is making sure his UK and Nato allies are not let of the hook when it comes to sharing the burden in the fight against them.  Not that all of this really matters in the military scheme of things, given that the Taliban is now said to be in control of 70 per cent of the country.  Yes, that\u0026rsquos the stark reality of where Afghanistan stands right now. Seventeen years on since a US and UK deployment that has cost tens of thousands of Afghan lives, thousands of American and British lives combined and swallowed up billions of dollars, we are right back where we started.  Only last month the New York Times highlighted how the newest US military strategy in Afghanistan \u0026ldquomirrors past plans for retreat. In other words it calls for American-backed Afghan troops to pull back from partially populated areas of the country.  This of course will ensure that the Taliban and other Islamist groups will effectively hold on to territory that they have already seized, leaving the government in Kabul to safeguard the capital and major cities such as Kandahar, Kunduz, Mazar-i-Sharif and Jalalabad. At least that\u0026rsquos how the thinking went until the Taliban this past week threw a spanner in the works with its assault on Ghazni.  What is this \u0026lsquoretreat to the city\u0026rsquo if not searing confirmation that the American installed government in Afghanistan remains unable to lead and protect the country\u0026rsquos sprawling rural population? Barely over one-quarter of Afghanistan\u0026rsquos population lives in urban areas.  If there\u0026rsquos a sense of deja vu about all of this, then it\u0026rsquos because those thirty or so years ago when I travelled with the Afghan guerrillas back in the 80\u0026rsquos, the Soviets then too in their own war had abandoned rural areas allowing opposition fighters to control most of the country.  We should have learned from the Russians own decade long experience then, but we didn\u0026rsquot. We should have learned too from our own more recent military campaign in the country, but it appears that we haven\u0026rsquot.  Unpalatable as it might be, the inescapable fact is that any chance of a political solution in Afghanistan right now is just as remote as a military one. Once again slowly but surely we are being drawn back into the Afghanistan quagmire, and it\u0026rsquos only a matter of time before it costs us dearly."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-may-my-quest-to-raise-profile-of-scottish-innovator-in-3d-photography","story":"  But while Queen\u0027s electric brand of arena-thrilling hits has stirred the souls of millions, the passions of the former PhD Astronomy student have turned out to be a little more niche.  Famously, he has been an unlikely champion of badgers and previously railed against the attempted cull of hedgehogs on Uist.  But (Dr) Brian May\u0027s current obsession germinates from a childhood devotion to collectable 3D cards handed out free in the 1950s inside boxes of Weetabix.  Now the Hall of Fame rock star is shining the spotlight on an almost forgotten photographic innovator who brought images of the Scottish landscape to life.  George Washington Wilson, based in Aberdeen, was appointed Photographer to the Queen in 1873 and is considered one of the greatest \u0027lensmen\u0027 of his generation.  Records of about his skill producing 3D images have now largely faded from history, but Wilson (1823 to 1893) is a personal hero to Brian May, who now owns one of the largest collections in the world of Victorian stereo photographs.  Brian May spoke to The Herald as he appeared at the Edinburgh International Book Festival discussing a \u0027labour of love\u0027 book about George Washington Wilson, by Prof Roger Taylor (who coincidentally shares the same name as the Queen drummer), for which May provided the introduction.  \"This is one of the reasons we got into this, is to try and put [George Washington Wilson] back in his place, where he should be,\" he said.  And May told an audience in the Main Theatre of the festival, at a sold out event,\u0026nbspthat his zeal for stereoscopic pictures sparked a curiosity to have a go himself, taking unique images of his family and bandmates.  One particularly intimate picture of Freddie Mercury, he finds particularly moving.  He said: \u0026ldquoMy favourite is one I had no knowledge of, which I did not remember, was one of Freddie backstage putting on make up.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos very intimate and very personal, it\u0026rsquos one the paparazzi would never get because he\u0026rsquod be so conscious of them.  \"But I was always there.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos something so precious to me, it\u0026rsquos not only candid and personal, but it is 3D as well, so it feels like you could walk into it and touch Freddie.  \u0026ldquoTo be honest, my team nursed me through it, because some of it was quite difficult for me, it can be a little bit too personal.  The latest George Washington Wilson book, published by May\u0027s London Stereoscopic Company (LSC) firm, follows a previous major work by Prof Taylor from1981 which fell out of print.  Speaking yesterday, Professor Taylor said: \"One of the reasons Wilson fell out of favour was because he was so prolific, he was everywhere and people couldn\u0027t make any sense of it.  \"But his real contribution to me is his 3D work, his stereoscopic work.\"  He added: \"I really hope this book will help put him back up there, because he really was important.  \"He was dismissed because he was commercial, but that reach and popularity and entrepreneurialism is something we celebrate.\"  George Washington Wilson, by Prof Roger Taylor, was published on 15 August"},{"url":null,"title":"yes-demo-at-snp-conference-to-urge-action-on-second-independence-referendum","story":"  In a further sign of division in the independence movement, scores of people are planning to demonstrate at the SNP conference in October to push for another vote.

Ms Sturgeon said last year that if the SNP won a majority of Scottish seats at Westminster it would convert her already \u0026ldquocast-iron mandate for a referendum into a \u0026ldquotriple lock one.  The other parts of the triple lock were the SNP win in the 2016 Holyrood election and a vote by a majority of MSPs for the transfer of referendum powers in March 2017.  However the First Minister \u0026ldquoreset her plans after the SNP lost a third of its MPs in the general election, and is due to update Holyrood on her new timetable in October.  Senior SNP figures such as MP Pete Wishart and MSP Alex Neil have urged caution, downplaying the prospect of another plebiscite in the near future.

The survey found a remarkable 86 per cent of Scots (95 per cent of SNP voters), regarded the process of leaving the EU so far as \u0026ldquoa mess.  It also found 65 per cent of Scots felt the UK government was ignoring Scotland\u0026rsquos concerns on Brexit, 70 per cent did not trust Westminster on Brexit, and 80 per cent, including most Leavers thought the promises of Brexiter politicians would be broken.  Most SNP, LibDem and Labour voters said Brexit would weaken the economy, cost jobs, lower living standards, hurt the NHS, raise taxes and make today\u0026rsquos children worse off.  Most Scottish Tory voters said Brexit would improve the same things or have no impact.  Asked if Brexit would make Scottish independence more likely, 43 per cent said yes, 6 per cent said less likely, and 35 per cent said it would make no difference.  The People\u0026rsquos Vote campaign said the findings would \u0026ldquopile pressure on the SNP and Labour leaderships to support a vote on the Brexit outcome.  Former YouGov president Peter Kellner said: \u0026ldquoSupport for a public vote on the outcome is growing across the UK but is particularly strong in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThere is deep pessimism about what Brexit will mean for Scotland and the next generation.  \u0026ldquoThe survey suggests the leaderships of both the SNP and the Labour Party are in the wrong place with most of their supporters.  \u0026ldquoThere may be an electoral dividend in Scotland for one of these parties if they strengthen their position. For instance, by a margin of three to one Labour supporters want Jeremy Corbyn to campaign for a public vote while Nicola Sturgeon may yet want to move faster than she has in backing such a route on Brexit.  The First Minister has said the SNP will not be a block to a vote on the Brexit deal, and said such a vote may be \u0026ldquoirresistible, but has never endorsed it.  Many Nationalists fear that if the SNP backed a second EU vote it would set a precedent that would be used against them in the event of a Yes to independence.  Former SNP minister Alex Neil, who backed Brexit, said: \u0026ldquoIf we supported a second Brexit referendum, when we win Indyref2, the Unionists would demand an Indyref3 to overturn it.  A separate poll for the Left Foot Forward website yesterday found most voters in the UK would blame Theresa May for a no-deal Brexit rather than the EU.  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie warned Ms Sturgeon and Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard were \u0026ldquoout of step with the country.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe benefits of remaining in the EU are irreplaceable and the people can see quite clearly that whatever deal the Conservatives patch together will not be as good as the one we have now. But even as the Conservatives bumble towards a cliff edge, Scottish Labour and the SNP are still refusing to swing into action.  \"Every day that passes Nicola Sturgeon and Richard Leonard are looking more out of step with the people of Scotland. They need to end the ifs and buts and listen to the huge majority of Scots calling for a final say.\"  An SNP spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoIt is a democratic outrage that Scotland is being forced out of the EU against our will. People in Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and the SNP continues to believe this is the best option for Scotland\u0026rsquos future.  We will not be a block on a second EU referendum but the views of the people of Scotland must not be ignored all over again if there is to be another vote.  \"The Tories now think they can do anything they want to Scotland and get away with it. Their extreme Brexit is threatening jobs, livelihoods and the interests of ordinary people, as well as the powers of the Scottish Parliament.  Former Labour PM Gordon Brown yesterday told the Edinburgh Book Festival more than 1m Labour Leave voters across the UK had turned against Brexit.  A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoA second referendum is not Labour policy and wasn\u0026rsquot in our manifesto. Labour has always insisted that Parliament has a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal.\""},{"url":null,"title":"royal-mail-redirection-service-designed-for-households-of-the-past-claims-citizens-advice","story":"  Citizens Advice said the service is \u0026ldquodesigned for households of the past by charging for each surname rather than by household.  Royal Mail said it agreed that a different pricing structure was needed and is currently \u0026ldquoworking on the details.  Currently, consumers pay an upfront fee based on the length of time they want to use the service, with three packages ranging from \u0026pound33.99 per surname for three months to \u0026pound66.99 for 12 months.  A couple with different surnames would therefore be charged double for the service, \u0026ldquopenalising unmarried couples and spouses who keep their own names, and children and elderly relatives with different surnames, the charity said.  Adding the cost of just one additional surname makes the service more expensive than any other country, its research found.  Citizens Advice, the statutory consumer advocate for postal services, found that more than half of people (55%) who have moved house within the last two years live with at least one person who has a different surname from them.  It found that, since 2012, the price of a three-month redirection has increased by 74%, while second-class stamps have only gone up 12%.  A quarter of those surveyed (26%) said the price was one of the reasons they did not use the service last time they moved.  Citizens Advice is also calling for Royal Mail to make the service more affordable by offering an option to pay in monthly instalments for those who cannot afford a one-off payment, and concessionary rates for consumers on the lowest incomes.  Some 84% of consumers think Royal Mail should ensure its redirection service is affordable for people who need to use it.  The same survey found those who did pay for mail redirection were highly satisfied with the service they received.  According to the Office for National Statistics, 32% of families have \u0026ldquonon-traditional structures outside the married heterosexual couple, such as cohabiting opposite-sex couples, same-sex couples and lone-parent families.  Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: \u0026ldquoMany people rely on Royal Mail\u0026rsquos redirection service, yet it\u0026rsquos designed for households of the past.  \u0026ldquoConsumers are facing a double whammy. Royal Mail has drastically increased the price of redirection over the years but hasn\u0026rsquot changed its outdated price structure that assumes families always share the same surname.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore calling on Royal Mail to change its mail redirection service to no longer charge per surname within the same household. As the dedicated universal service provider, it has a duty to make sure this service is fair and affordable.  A Royal Mail spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe agree with Citizens Advice that there is a need for a different pricing structure.  \u0026ldquoWe wrote to Citizens Advice last week, before the report was issued, to confirm that we will change the pricing structure of our popular redirections service away from a per surname basis or anything similar.  \u0026ldquoWe are currently working on the details of this new pricing structure and will share once finalised.

Large-scale coral bleaching has raised concern about the future of the ecosystems and the impact their loss could have on biodiversity.  The teams found the frequency of bleaching has increased since the 1800s and, despite corals\u0026rsquo ability to recover,\u0026nbspthere are fears they could now be approaching a \u0026ldquocritical threshold.  Dr Nick Kamenos from Glasgow\u0026rsquos School of Geographical and Earth Sciences said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos clear in the core data we examined that bleaching has been occurring on the Great Barrier Reef for at least 400 years, but the frequency of bleaching events has increased markedly since the early 1800s and those events have affected 10% more corals since the late 1700s.  \u0026ldquoWe can see that corals have been able to acclimate and recover from past bleaching events.  \u0026ldquoHowever, the increase in bleaching frequency and the numbers of corals affected since temperatures started consistently increasing in the modern era raises serious concerns about whether corals are approaching a critical threshold beyond which their long-term survival is uncertain.  Bleaching occurs when water temperatures rise too high and disrupt the relationship between the coral and the tiny algae living inside it.  When the algae are expelled, it leaves the coral a stark white. They\u0026nbspcan be reabsorbed when the water temperature drops again, but corals die if this separation is too long.  Dr Sebastian Hennige from Edinburgh\u0026rsquos School of Geosciences said: \u0026ldquoFor this study we used the most conservative methods we could in some of the toughest corals out there today.  \u0026ldquoThe fact that we are seeing an increase in bleaching even in these tough corals highlights just how serious the threat of coral bleaching is, and how important it is that we take action now to reduce this threat.  The paper, titled Reconstructing four centuries of temperature-induced coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, is published in the journal Frontiers.  The study was supported by funding from the Natural Environment Research Council, the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Scottish Government."},{"url":null,"title":"holy-grail-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-up-to-900000","story":"  The 1926 Macallan Valerio Adami is due to be auctioned at Bonhams Whisky Sale in Edinburgh in October with an estimation of between \u0026pound700,000 and \u0026pound900,000.

The box contains items such as clothing, a toy, a play mat, books, a towel, a sling carrier and thermometers. Meanwhile, the box itself can be used as a sleeping space for new babies.  The projected cost of the initiative was \u0026pound8 million for 2017/18, rising to \u0026pound8.8 million for each of the following three years.  Maree Todd, the Children and Early Years Minister at Holyrood, said the gift shows that \u0026ldquothe country welcomes this baby too.  On the take-up of the box, she told Press Association Scotland: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos amazing. When I saw that over 50,000 babies had received a box \u0026ndash over 1,000 a week \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a really exciting point in the history of this baby box.  \u0026ldquoI think this is about the baby box becoming part of the national psyche in Scotland.  She told how the box contains several items that parents might not necessarily think of buying.  \u0026ldquoSome of the most positive feedback comes from the thermometers, she said.  \u0026ldquoThe ear thermometer, in particular, is quite an expensive piece of kit and people don\u0026rsquot think about buying it necessarily until the baby is sick.  \u0026ldquoSo it\u0026rsquos great that it comes in the baby box and they are able to use it and access medical help and support quickly if they need it.  Critics at the start of the scheme suggested that giving the box to any eligible parents, including those who can easily afford the contents, did not represent the best use of public funds.  However, Ms Todd insisted: \u0026ldquoI think that (the universality) is one of the nicest things about the box.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos one of the things that many parents give me very positive feedback about. They like it that every baby in the land is welcomed in the same way and there\u0026rsquos no stigma associated with it.  Ms Todd was speaking following an event at the Museum of Childhood in Edinburgh, where a baby box is to go on display.  A parent survey earlier revealed the most popular items were the room thermometer, followed by the ear thermometer and the sling.  The majority of mothers and fathers (62%) said they had used or planned to use the box as a bed.          Tomorrow is the 1st birthday of Scotland\u0027s baby box!

A: Clearing is the annual process that allows students without a university place, or who want to switch to a different one, to search for and find a degree course with availability.  You can use Clearing if you are applying for the first time after June 30, if you did not receive any offers from any universities, or none you wanted to accept, or if you did not meet the required grades needed for your chosen university course.  Q: When does Clearing open and how long does it last?  A: Clearing opened on July 5 and closes on October 23.  Q: How do I apply for a university place through Clearing?  A: If you haven\u0026rsquot already applied for a university place through the main application scheme, you need to submit an application to Ucas. You will then be sent an email and have access to Ucas\u0026rsquos online system, Track. You\u0026rsquoll also be given a Clearing number.  Search for courses you are interested in, and when you have found one you want to study, call the university or college and ask them if they will accept you. You\u0026rsquoll need to give them your Clearing number.  Once you have found one you are happy with, and they have said they will take you, you can add the course through Track.  Q: How do I add a Clearing choice?  A: Once you\u0026rsquove chosen your course and the university or college has said they\u0026rsquoll accept you, click \u0026ldquoadd clearing choice on the Track system and fill in the course details.  The university will then confirm your place.  Filling in and submitting the course details means you have definitely accepted the offer, so if the university confirms it, it will show as an acceptance on your \u0026ldquochoices page in Track.  You can only add one choice at a time. You\u0026rsquoll be able to add a different one if the university or college does not confirm your place.  Q: How long does Clearing take?  A: How long it takes depends on how long you want to take to make a choice, and how long it takes for the university or college you choose to confirm your place.  Q: How does Clearing work in Scotland?  A: Clearing works the same way for all students, regardless of where they live in the UK.  Q: When do universities get A-level results?  A: Universities receive prospective students\u0026rsquo grades in the days before A-level results day under strict embargo to allow them to confirm whether applicants have gained the required results. Students can sign in to Track on ucas from 8am on August 16, where they will be able to see if they\u0026rsquove been accepted.  Q: Is it easy to get into university through Clearing?  A: There are around 30,000 courses available in Clearing, and each one will have different grade and qualification requirements.  You should think carefully about what you want to do and where you want to study, as well as whether you meet the requirements to be accepted on to the course.  There is now no cap on the number of students a university or college can admit, so many institutions will still be looking for good candidates for their degree courses through Clearing.

It is also asking the public to share their experiences as part of the investigation, and said it was particularly interested in hearing from people who had bought products which were endorsed on social media.  Typically, celebrities and influencers have millions of followers who watch their channels to see where they go on holiday, what they wear, which products they use, the books they read and more.  Online endorsements from celebrities and influencers can help brands reach target audiences and boost sales.  However, influencers must make it clear in such posts that they have been paid or rewarded to promote, review or talk about a product in their social media feeds under consumer protection law.  The CMA said fans or followers could be led to believe that an endorsement represents the star\u0026rsquos own view, rather than it being a paid-for promotion, if they do not label their posts properly.  It said it was investigating the extent to which influencers are clearly and accurately identifying any commercial relationships, and whether people are being misled.  George Lusty, the CMA\u0026rsquos senior director for consumer protection, said: \u0026ldquoSocial media stars can have a big influence on what their followers do and buy.  \u0026ldquoIf people see clothes, cosmetics, a car, or holiday being plugged by someone they admire, they might be swayed into buying it.  \u0026ldquoSo, it\u0026rsquos really important they are clearly told whether a celebrity is promoting a product because they have bought it themselves, or because they have been paid or thanked in some way by the brand."},{"url":null,"title":"education-secretary-told-of-child-left-covered-in-faeces-at-school","story":"  The woman, who gave her name as Marie, was taking part in a BBC Radio Scotland phone-in when she told John Swinney she is now home schooling her daughter after a series of incidents.

For not only will it commemorate the centenary of the end of World War One, but it will also mark the centenary of the restoration of Poland’s sovereignty as the Second Polish Republic from the German, Austrian and Russian Empires.                                       \t      \t\tLabour of love...for Keith Burns, project manager from MAPA Scotland, the charity founded to restore the Great Polish Map of Scotland in 2010. Some eight years and \u0026#65533120,000 later, that goal has now been achieved.      \t                                                             The independence celebrations will be marked here in Scotland by Polish people across the country.                                                    And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

These are exciting proposals and it is going to be important that everyone understands the vision for future care in Caithness.\u0026ldquoThis is about making sure that as many people as possible can take part and have their say.The proposals resulted from extensive engagement to explore possible options. NHS Highland recently approved the move to public consultation, which has been widely welcomed.The preferred option includes the development of a proposed care hub/village at the Dunbar Hospital site in Thurso and the Pulteney House care home site in Wick.The plans also include a multimillion-pound upgrade for Caithness General as part of an overall \u0026pound30 million investment for the area.The option of developing Wick\u0026rsquos Town and County Hospital will also be included in the consultation.The Wick event will be held on Monday, August 20, between 6pm and 7pm, while the Thurso one takes place the following evening at the same time.People planning to attend either should contact Christian Nicolson of NHS Highland on 07870513114 or email christian.nicolson@nhs.net to help ensure adequate seating can be provided.The health authority says further events will be arranged in due course and dates will be widely publicised.Thursday 16 Aug 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"We just werent at the races says Academy boss after opening day derby defeat","story":"DEJECTED Wick Academy manager Tom McKenna watched his side succumb to a 2-0 derby defeat to Brora Rangers and admitted: \u0026ldquoWe just weren\u0026rsquot at the races.Goals by Kyle Macleod on the stroke of half-time and Craig Campbell just before the hour mark gave Brora a 2-0 win at Dudgeon Park on Saturday in Steven Mackay\u0026rsquos first competitive match as player/manager.Rarely will you see a more one-sided game with a mere two-goal margin of victory, and after the final whistle McKenna admitted his team had been second best throughout.\u0026ldquoWe were lethargic, we were disjointed, there was no fluency in our game, he said.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to take anything away from Brora \u0026ndash they were by far the better team.

They moved on towards Stroma and she alerted the ferry team.Mr Fermor said: \u0026ldquoThe orcas stayed at Stroma for a while and although some distance from John O\u0026rsquoGroats it caused a bit of a stir onshore and Karen generously let visitors view the whales through her powerful telescope.Meanwhile, Sea Watch Foundation says its latest National Whale and Dolphin Watch event looks like being the best in the past two decades in terms of the unprecedented variety of species of whales and dolphins seen around the British Isles.The event involved thousands of volunteers from all around the British Isles and was conducted between July 28 and August 5.This summer\u0026rsquos stable weather is one possible explanations for the high number of cetacean sightings in the country as a whole, with higher temperatures bringing warmer-water species and creating the conditions for plankton fronts to develop \u0026ndash attracting shoals of fish and, in turn, whales and dolphins.Meanwhile, Sea Watch Foundation says its latest National Whale and Dolphin Watch event looks like being the best in the past two decades in terms of the unprecedented variety of species of whales and dolphins seen around the British Isles.The event involved thousands of volunteers and was conducted between July 28 and August 5.Thursday 16 Aug 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August 16, 2018 at 12:04 pmTHE SCOTTISH Government are asking for your view on the costs of funerals through a national consultation published today (Thursday).

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Thursday 16 Aug 2018 12:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this.

People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife. Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Thursday 16 Aug 2018 12:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Thursday 16 Aug 2018 12:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Now locals on Tiree are looking for a new minister to lead the Church of Scotland congregation on the island, which covers an area of 30 square miles.            While one of the Kirk’s more remote postings, whoever takes up the job will be able to enjoy living in a manse just yards from the beach as well as performing a prominent role in the tight-knit community, which has a Christian tradition dating back to the sixth century.            Jo Bennett, clerk of the congregation’s nominating committee, said: “People talk about Iona as a thin place – a place where the distance between heaven and earth collapses.  “I think Tiree has that too, but it’s also very much a working community - you get both aspects here.“A minister here has the chance to see the impact of the work they do and be the focal point for the community.”READ MORE: Message in a bottle sent from Iceland washes up on Tiree after a yearMr Bennett said the congregation was regularly boosted in the summer months by visitors from around the world.             “In Summer we get visitors from around the world but in winter it may be much smaller,” he added.“It’s always a mixture of people who visit regularly and people visiting for the first time.”The manse is situated outside the village of Scarinish, just yards from the sea and with views to the Treshnish Isles, Mull and Iona across the passage of Tiree.Although the church building only dates to 1902, Tiree has a long Christian tradition going back to St Columba and his companion Beithene, who was the abbot on the island in the sixth century.            The local population boasts the highest proportion of Gaelic speakers in the Inner Hebrides.An advert for the position states: “We seek a minister who finds that their heart resonates with this island and this community who can meet us where we are and help guide us towards where we should be who can “be Christ” in this place to people who need His love.“Tiree is not a place that allows for anything other than going ‘all in’.“People will know when you leave the Manse they’ll know where you’ve been visiting what you’ve been buying in the Co-op and when your cooker has stopped working.“But they will also wave and stop for a chat when they see you notice the work you put in to visiting and come by with food or invite you round for dinner when your cooker isn’t working.” "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4784800.1534403618!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon to address fishing industry summit on brexit","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

The lack of a debate on Andrew Wilson\u0026#8217s Growth Commission at SNP conference is a startling omission, writes Tom Peterkin.                Councillor Christopher McEleny is fast emerging as one of the SNP’s more colourful characters. Twice he has stood to be SNP depute leader. Twice he has been defeated, firstly by Angus Robertson, and most recently by Keith Brown, the former Economy Secretary who is now Nicola Sturgeon’s right-hand man as far as the party is concerned.            Despite being on the receiving end of comprehensive defeats, the Inverclyde councillor refuses to slide back into the relative obscurity of local authority politics.            It was earlier this month that Mr McEleny found himself in the headlines when the judge in an employment tribunal ruled that his support for Scottish independence qualified as a “philosophical belief”. The conclusion was reached by judge Frances Eccles in a case that saw Mr McEleny pursue his former employer, the Ministry of Defence, claiming he had been unfairly targeted over his views.The background to the case was that around the time of his first unsuccessful attempt to become SNP depute leader in 2016, he was told that his security clearance had been revoked for his job as an electrician at the MoD munitions site in Beith, North Ayrshire.He said he was interviewed by national security officials on issues including his pro-independence views. After being suspended from his job, he left it, claiming he was unfairly targeted for his stance on leaving the UK and his support for the “social democratic values” of the SNP.READ MORE: SNP Growth Commission report: Five key points            In her judgment, Judge Eccles rather neatly summed up exactly how Mr McEleny felt about Scottish independence.“The claimant was clear in his evidence that he does not believe in Scottish independence because it will necessarily lead to improved economic and social conditions for people living in Scotland”, she said. “It is a fundamental belief in the right of Scotland to national sovereignty.”So there you have it. Mr McEleny’s belief in breaking up the UK runs through him like letters through a stick of rock. His desire for indep­endence is so strong that it trumps pro-indy arguments based on the notion that securing a Yes vote is the best way to improve Scotland economically and socially.Given that independence – come what may and damn the consequences – appears to be an existential part of the councillor’s being, it was perhaps somewhat surprising to see his most recent contribution to internal SNP politics.            Earlier this week Mr McEleny took to Twitter to reveal that the party’s latest independence blueprint will not be debated at its October conference. He said it was “absolutely astonishing” that the list of 32 motions for debate in Glasgow did not include any of Andrew Wilson’s much-vaunted Growth Commission or his proposal to stick with the pound for around a decade after independence. Even the man for whom independence is a “philosophical belief” is objecting to the party’s failure to take a long and hard look at the harsh economic reality at independence. A similar row erupted before the SNP’s most recent conference in June, which happened to take place shortly after Mr Wilson published his 354-page magnum opus.Despite the fact that the SNP document was the hot topic of the moment, there was no formal debate on its proposals, which are absolutely fundamental to the party’s next drive for independence. Instead, discussion of the document was relegated to a fringe meeting. That meeting offered some explanation as to why it might suit the SNP not to pore over the document in public. It was easily the stormiest session of the conference as the former SNP MP and economist George Kerevan criticised its contents. READ MORE: SNP Growth Commission strengthens case for union, claims pro-UK think tankThe future plotted by the commission would, said Mr Kerevan, leave Scotland “at the mercy” of the banks, because its plans to keep the pound without Bank of England protection for a decade would hinder the ability to grow the Scottish economy. This, he argued, would put the poor at risk.            The difficulty for the SNP is that Mr Kerevan’s views are shared by many who, like him, can be found on the left of the party. Mr Wilson won praise for constructing a more realistic case for independence than that made in Alex Salmond’s white paper published ahead of the 2014 referendum.But realism can have its drawbacks. Mr Wilson’s approach to cutting Scotland’s £13.3 billion deficit has seen the highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies warn that Scotland would see a “continuation of austerity”.One can understand why the SNP leadership might be reluctant to air these points and internal divisions at their autumn shindig. Rather, the Growth Commission is to be discussed internally at a series of SNP National Assemblies. The outcome of these discussions are then scheduled to be brought before party conference in spring next year or the National Council this coming December. In the meantime, it feels strange to be heading to another SNP conference where the biggest elephant in the room will be Mr Wilson’s indy blueprint.Or as the Inverclyde councillor who is rapidly becoming the SNP’s best-known controversialist put it: “How can we not be debating the biggest contribution to the independence case since 2014?”That may not amount to a “philosophical belief” for Councillor McEleny, but it is still a pretty good point."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4784782.1534402548!/image/image.jpg","title":"poll nearly half of scots would support brexit deal referendum","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another.

A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way.

But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"maunsie da market cross introduces shopping week ","story":"The Lerwick Shopping Week begins today (Monday) with the announcement of the new town centre mascot.\n\u0026#8220Maunsie da Market Cross\u0026#8221 was designed by local artist Stephen Gordon, and chosen from 28 entries to a competition which sought a character to represent Lerwick town centre.\nLiving Lerwick project manager Emma Miller said: \u0026#8220We were looking for something that visually represented the town centre and Stephen\u0026#8217s entry was just perfect – you can\u0026#8217t get anything more representative of the toon centre than the market cross.\n\u0026#8220The standard of entries was excellent and we’d like to thank everyone who took the time to put their ideas on paper.\u0026#8221\nAs part of the shopping week activities the public can search for Maunsie in local shops by collecting a form from the VisitScotland office at the Market Cross.\nThere will also be a life-sized version of Maunsie visiting a number of shops for the public to meet him and take selfies for uploading to social media.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nThursday 16 Aug 2018 12:40 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116807.jpg","title":"Dont play mother to lost wildcat kittens","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nThe public is being urged to be hands off if they spot a possible Scottish Wildcat kitten in the wilds of Strathspey unless they are certain it is in immediate danger.\nExperts have issued the warning after a well-meaning member of the public removed possible kittens from the wild and their mother.\nRare wildcats \u0026ndash and other cats in the countryside \u0026ndash are now at an age when they are out and about, even without their mums.\nScottish Wildcat Action Project Officer Emma Rawling said: \"If anyone sees tabby kittens alone in a possible wildcat area and or if mother looks like a wildcat, the public should be cautious and assume they could be wildcat kittens.\n\"Wildcats are protected by law.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch.

As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/david-mundell.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

Tourism makes a critical contribution to the local economy, and indeed the wider Scottish economy, and indirectly enables people to live, work and raise a family on the island.\n“As such, we write to categorically assert that Skye and Raasay is well and truly open for business.”\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27426  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nJoint stewardship through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference amounts to an honest and responsible effort to protect and advance the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement framework.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference met today in London today for the first time in ten years. \nThe body involves ministers from both the British and Irish governments meeting to discuss a range of issues was created by the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. \nThe conference has not met since 2007, shortly before the return of the political institutions in the north when Sinn Féin and the DUP agreed to share power. \nSinn Féin have been calling for a meeting of the conference to be convened ever since the DUP collapsed talks designed to reestablish an Executive in February. \nSinn Féin Deputy Leader Michelle O\u0027Neill welcomed today\u0027s meeting, describing it as an \"important step\" towards power sharing. \n“Today’s conference of both the Irish and British Governments is an important step to help remove the obstacles to genuine power-sharing and for London and Dublin to fulfil their own obligations in respect to the Good Friday Agreement, the Stormont House Agreement and other outstanding matters relating to citizens\u0027 rights, legacy matters and All-Ireland co-operation.\n“In the absence of the Assembly and Executive at this time, the choice is between the protection of the Good Friday Agreement which is under constant attack, by the hard Brexiteers within the DUP and Tory party, or its abandonment.\n“We have made clear that for Irish nationalism any return to British direct rule would represent its abandonment and is therefore unacceptable.\nMichelle O\u0027Neill said both the British and Irish governments have a responsibility to ensure the Good Friday Agreement is implemented. \n“Together both governments have a clear duty under the Good Friday Agreement to make determined efforts to support the re-establishment of the institutions.\n“Joint stewardship through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference amounts to an honest and responsible effort to protect and advance the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement framework.\n“The conference allows both governments to co-operate at all levels on all matters and despite the fact they allowed it to lapse, having not met since 2007, we welcome today’s meeting and the fact the Governments themselves are getting back on board with this process,\" she said. \n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27427  ","story":" Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language - Declan Kearney\nAntrim and Newtownabbey Borough council is overwhelmingly unionist.\nThe Borough makes up the larger part of my South Antrim constituency.\nOn the 26th February last the council rejected a petition to support the provision of bilingual (English and Irish) streets/roads signage in the area.\nUnionist councillors then decided to go a step further and passed a motion committing Antrim and Newtownabbey council to an ‘English only’ policy.\n\nThat was a ridiculous and stupid stance to adopt.\nIt is also unlawful.\nThis new council policy is in breach of Article 11 of the Local Government Order 1995, and it violates the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages.\nBut it is also an affront to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect and equality enshrined within the Good Friday Agreement (GFA).\nThe decision taken was a deeply insulting message aimed directly at those who live and pay rates within Antrim and Newtownabbey who identify as Irish citizens, who cherish the Irish language, and Gaelic cultural traditions.\nIt does not matter in the narrow, blinkered world of those who control political unionism in Antrim and Newtownabbey council that the Irish language and cultural identity actually matters to a significant section of rate payers in the borough.\nThe Gaelic Athletic Association runs deep in this part of County Antrim. It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

inspires local woman to take on berlin marathon","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman is taking on 26.2 miles at one of the world’s most famous marathons on September 16 to help raise money for the British Heart Foundation Northern Ireland (BHF NI).\n  \nMairead Agnew was inspired by her young neighbour Mark Lynn, who has complex congenital heart disease. At just 8 years old, he has undergone four open heart surgeries and numerous cardiac procedures. \n  \nIn 2015 Mark was diagnosed with heart failure but this still hasn’t stopped him and his parents Donna and Geoff supporting BHF NI and raising almost \u0026pound3,000 for the charity.\n  \nMairead explained: “My sister was born with congenital heart disease so this is a cause that has always been extremely close to mine and my family’s hearts. When I saw the wonderful fundraising that Mark and his family had raised, I wanted to do something to help. When I told Mark I was taking on the Berlin Marathon, he was sure he wanted us to support BHF NI once again.”\n  \nKaren McCammon, Health Services Engagement Lead for BHF NI explained: “When the BHF was founded in 1961, 8 out of every 10 babies born with congenital heart disease died before their first birthday. Our research has helped to turn this around, and now 8 out of 10 babies survive to adulthood. Breakthroughs such as these are only possible because of the support we receive from supporters like Mairead, Mark and his family. We are therefore extremely grateful for all their efforts.”\n  \nBHF have also developed pioneering surgical techniques to treat complex congenital defects.

I understand that the work is expected to last right up until Christmas.\n  \n“My issue is firstly there has been no consultation, I don\u0027t know exactly what they are planning to do. \n  \n“We are relying on hearsay at the minute and I have heard that there are plans to lay stone similar to the rest of the town.” \n  \nClaire said she had written a letter to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council about the issue.\n  \nShe continued: “It took ten days to get a reply which said there was “nothing concrete at the minute”.\n  \nClaire said that among her concerns was that the area has a very slopping street which raises issues around what type of paving is used.\n  \nShe added: “Also there are concerns around water flowing down the street due to the slope and the fact that if the paving used is light in colour chewing gum, which will eventually cover it, will turn black and soon make the street look grubby and shabby.”\n  \nClaire said she would like to see either the street remain the same and be “brought back to its former glory” or be consulted on any proposed plans.\n  \n“We want to have a debate about it, not have to rely on hearsay. I have a sizeable investment in this street and I feel as a business owner I should have a say,” she concluded.\n  \nA Mid and East Antrim Council spokesperson said: “Plans are being considered to extend the public realm scheme on this street, however, these are at a very early stage. \n  \n“We will be liaising with traders over the coming weeks in relation to initial consultation on concept designs.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921291.jpg--.jpg?1534232684000\n","title":"dungonnell dam features on ulster giants tv show","story":"  \nA reservoir in the hills between Ballymena and the glens features in the new series celebrating the achievements in Northern Ireland of the Institution of Civil Engineers on the occasion of their 200th anniversary. \n  \nThe fifth episode of ‘Ulster Giants’, which continues on Monday, August 20 at 8pm on UTV is all about water and the various ways in which it has been collected, stored and treated before being delivered to our homes and workplaces. \n  \nJoe Mahon’s first port of call is the now abandoned Hunt’s Park Water Tower in Donaghadee in Co. Down. \n  \nAnd of local interest, he also visits the water treatment works at Dungonnell Dam in the Antrim Hills. \n  \nJoe interviews Derek McKane of NI Water, who demonstrates the operation of the dam and takes him on a tour of the bewildering number of processes our modern water supply has to undergo before it is deemed fit for human consumption. \n  \n“After watching this you’ll never take tap water for granted again!” Joe promises.\n  \nCivil engineer Alan Cooper then directs our attention to the innovative construction of the actual dam itself – the first to be built using asphalt, and employing many of the same construction methods you would find in road-building! Alan rounds off with some insights into the general history of dam-building in this country and relates how civil engineering has developed its own code of ethics over the 200 years since the foundation of the Institution of Civil Engineers.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921285.jpg--.jpg?1534232428000\n","title":"estelle in the frame for spectacle wearer of year win","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman has been chosen from thousands of proud glasses wearers as a finalist for Specsavers’ Spectacle Wearer of the Year.\n  \nEstelle Wallace, shortlisted in the 45 – 59 age category from Rasharkin could follow in the footsteps of last year’s Award winner, Love Island hunk Alex Miller, winning \u0026pound10,000 and the chance to mingle with the stars at the annual awards. \n  \nGlasses wearers across the UK and Republic of Ireland have been showing off their specs style by sharing their selfies online.\n  \nEstelle, who is a health and wellness coach, was invited to visit her local Specsavers store in Fairhill Shopping Centre to receive a bottle of champagne, a certificate and a \u0026pound125 glasses voucher.\n  \nEstelle said: “I was really delighted to be shortlisted as a regional finalist.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

They know the Cadet movement is as much committed to building confidence and friendships as it is to building skills.\n\n“Our Banbridge Cadets embraced every opportunity brought to them at this year’s Summer Camp, held at Strensall, near York, with great good humour and seemingly boundless energy. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Now, following a Summer packed with challenge and achievement, they’ll be turning their attention to their annual new membership campaign and I am sure they will all become highly persuasive recruiters as they invite local teenagers to come along and see what Cadet life has to offer.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more about what membership of the Army, Sea or Air Cadets can offer you or your children, contact 0800 730 730 or visit www.reservesandcadetsni.org.uk.

This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost.

This is the biggest thing I’ve ever had to look forward to and hopefully something that will genuinely change my life, for the better, forever. I’m particularly excited to become a DWU Tiger and play for the school soccer team - I think that’ll be cool and something so different to teams at home.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“I decided to apply for Study USA because I’d heard that it was an amazing experience and I know without a doubt the programme will have a positive impact on my future -  It’ll make me look more attractive to employers showing I took the chance to go and grow as person both independently and communicatively.\n\n“Hopefully it will also broaden my own personal network which in itself is an intangible asset to any business employing me as they gain potential connections in America, should they be necessary.”\n\nThe British Council, which is the UK’s international organisation for educational opportunities and cultural relations, manages Study USA on behalf of the Department for the Economy. Since its formation in 1994, the initiative has sent over 2000 students from Northern Ireland to all four corners of the United States where they have successfully completed a year studying\n\nJonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland, added: “I am confident that the students departing for the US this year will be great ambassadors for Northern Ireland and will help to further important long-term links and connections. A recent report published by the British Council has highlighted that the relationship between the US and the UK is driven as much by cultural factors, as political with programmes such as Study USA supporting these links and strengthening them for the future. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Through Study USA, students will have the opportunity to not only enhance their employability skills but also develop intercultural skills, which will help them to prepare to work in a global economy.

In addition, the company has faced an extremely challenging retail trading environment reflecting weak consumer confidence and reduced consumer spending. These factors have had a significant adverse impact on Homebase’s trading position.\n\n“After a comprehensive review, Homebase has concluded that its current store portfolio mix is no longer viable. Rental costs associated with stores are unsustainable and many stores are loss making.\n\n“The CVA enables Homebase to make essential changes to its store portfolio, reducing its cost base and providing a stable platform on which to continue its turnaround.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Under the terms of the CVA proposal, all creditors receive a better outcome than any other likely alternative.\n\n“It is anticipated that 42 stores will close during late 2018 and early 2019.\n\n“The proposed changes to the store portfolio will regrettably mean redundancies from those stores earmarked for closure. The process is expected to lead to a reduction of up to 1,500 roles, although every effort will be made to redeploy team members within the business where possible.\n\n“All stores in the UK and the Republic of Ireland will remain open for business as usual and this process will have no impact on customer purchases, outstanding orders or any product or service guarantees.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The creditors will vote on the CVA on 31 August 2018.”\n\nDamian McGloughlin, CEO of Homebase, said: “Launching a CVA has been a difficult decision and one that we have not taken lightly. Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the underperformance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs. The CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.”\n\nStephanie Pollitt, Assistant Director of Real Estate Policy, British Property Federation (BPF), said: “These situations are never easy as property owners need to take into consideration the impact on their investors, including those protecting their investors’ pensioners’ savings, as they vote on the CVA proposal. Homebase and Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal have, however, demonstrated best practice, engaging with the BPF in the process and therefore ensuring property owners’ interests have been properly taken into account. Ultimately, it will be for individual property owners to decide how they will vote on the CVA, but the proposal has sought to find a solution that provides a sustainable future for Homebase.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8478809.1533901811!/image/image.jpg","title":"was speeding in hurry to get to work","story":"\nIn a hurry to get to work a 49-year-old man broke the speed limit in his van, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nAsen Asenov, whose address was given as Flush Place, Lurgan, was fined £75 for excess speed on May 30 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThree penalty points were also imposed and he was ordered to pay a £15 offender’s levy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor having a defective light on his vehicle he was fined £50.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe court heard that at 11.30pm on the Portadown Road in Lurgan police saw a Mercedes Sprinter van with a Bulgarian registration travelling in excess of the 40mph speed limit.\n\nThey followed the van for a distance of over half a mile and to keep up they were doing between 60mph and 65mph.\n\nPolice also noticed that the right rear side light was not working.\n\nThrough an interpreter Asenov said he had been rushing that day.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe explained that he had already received a warning about his job and he didn’t want to be late.

As the years went on they became less and less involved, but they were still on our board of directors for a number of years.\n“As time went on we became more secular and we didn’t have that relationship with the Church anymore. But we’re still very grateful for them for setting it up and for identifying the huge need for counselling and support in this area, I suppose because Ardoyne was hit so hard by the conflict.\n“The Passionists worked tirelessly, and I remember sister Kathleen constantly bringing funders into a room and saying ‘You have got to fund this.’ Because there was very little funding in the early days she worked extremely hard to get us established, funded and working.\n“We have grown considerably, and we now deliver about 12,000 to 13,000 sessions a year to about 2,500 people. As well as operating from this site, we also work in a range of local schools and community venues. If someone wants to be seen or needs help somewhere else we can do that too.”\nNorma continued: “Our clinical practice is excellent. We have just been awarded BACP [British Association for Counselling and Psycho-therapy) accreditation for our services. Most counsellors are individually accredited by the BACP, but very few organisations carry the accreditation. We are one of only six in Northern Ireland to be accredited this year.”\nWith a degree in psychology and a professional background in both therapy and conflict resolution, Norma said that New Life felt like a place where she could make a difference.\nIn the past, she has worked at New Life as a sessional counsellor and her experience in play therapy has allowed her to help children and adults alike. New Life is one of the few organisations in the north that offers child and family therapy – services that Norma insists are vital for North Belfast.\n“I think in this area you are working with generations of people who have had things really difficult,” she said.\n“Personal safety was at risk throughout the Troubles and the area has grown up with generations and generations of high unemployment. Poverty, conflict and trauma have a huge impact, not just psychologically, but on a cellular level it impacts people physically.\n“Poverty also has a huge impact on children’s education and a number of different things, so we’re working with multiple issues for a lot of families and they are trying really hard to overcome those things. It has a massive impact on people’s self-esteem, so it’s almost a vicious cycle.”\nShe continued: “There is a lot of research that has come out recently into adverse experience in childhood and the impact that those have on physical health, mental health, and educational achievement. The aim is to try to tackle things early. I think that’s why we believe that child therapy is so important, because you’ve got to be working with children from an early age to begin to address their issues early on.\n“If you don’t catch certain things in childhood, sometimes you’re working with very difficult teenage years because it’s harder to intervene. Sometimes those teenagers will come back as adults and they will feel like they are ready to tackle the issue at that stage.\n“At any stage in life it’s encouraging to know that anything can be repaired. Our brains are wonderful organs and in many ways they have a great plasticity so you can address those issues, you just have to be motivated and have the right motivator to identify what that change might look like.\n“Not everybody needs counselling, sometimes a friend or a colleague or anyone you can connect with can transform things for you. Talking to anybody helps you and can help you, but counselling gives a framework and a focus for those who need it.\n“If you can catch people before they hit the crisis it’s much better. When you’re in a crisis your ability to think clearly, to support yourself or to act lessens, so it’s much harder to activate the changes you need. If you can get into counselling when you’re not in crisis then you’ll be able to change things more quickly, but counselling can really help. It helps you to clear your mind enough to realise what needs to happen next to take you out of crisis.”\nWhile New Life has come on leaps and bounds since it began, offering thousands of yearly counselling sessions, Norma admits that mental health charities, including New Life, need more support to effectively help those in need of support.\n“I think pre-Troubles we didn’t have nearly enough mental health services,” she said.\n“People were just in lockdown mode, they were just surviving. Since the peace process there has been a lot more services established. I think mental health services are still desperately underfunded in Northern Ireland given what we have come through.\n“For our service we have a six-month waiting list and sometimes it can go up to a year. If you need a counsellor it’s way too long to wait, but we don’t have the funding to deliver any more sessions than we currently do.\n“I think there needs to be more accessible services. People get fed up sitting on a waiting list and a lot can happen in that space of time.”\nShe concluded: “If you do need someone to talk to it’s important that you come forward.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"a level results boys outperform girls for top grades for first time","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I congratulate them all and wish them the very best for their future,\" said Justin Edwards, chief executive of exam board CCEA.\n\n\"Once again, Northern Ireland’s students have performed well, with a steady and strong performance across all grades. The results are also recognition of the dedication and support provided by teachers and schools.\"\n\nMathematics remains the most popular A Level subject choice, with Biology, Religious Studies, English Literature and History making up the top five. \n\nThere was a small increase in the number of students studying Science STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), going from 39.7% and 40.1%. \n\nIn total, there were 29,004 people who took their A Levels, a decrease of 5.8% on the year before which is in line with changing demographics. \n\nWriting on Twitter on Thursday, DUP leader Arlene Foster congratulated all of those who received their results. \n\n\nNervous mummy, but now a very proud mummy! Congratulations to all those receiving results today! Remember that there is always more than one route to success.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany. The star received thousands of goodwill messages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland twelfth cleanup costs revealed","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"temporary morgues planned for popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"alevel chinese more popular than german","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Student perceptions that languages are more difficult and less important than other subjects need to be tackled.\n\n“Against this overall downward trend, the increasing popularity of Chinese proves that our young people can be enthused to study languages. Our research shows that Mandarin will be one of the most important languages for the UK’s future prosperity and global standing – but we mustn’t neglect Spanish, French and German, which will still be vital post-Brexit.\n\n“Learning a foreign language doesn’t just boost job prospects by providing vital skills that employers are looking for, it also helps us understand other cultures and work internationally.\n\n“We all need to encourage our young people to see the value of languages and embrace them as important subjects to study at A-level and beyond.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"man who filmed up womens skirts given suspended sentence","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

You were uploading the images on to a website. You were recording them and there were several victims.”\n\nSivier, of Warren Road, Cambridge, admitted at a hearing earlier this month outraging public decency.\n\nThe charge stated that on June 20 at Horse Guards Parade in London he had used a camera while walking along to film under females’ skirts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard Sivier leaves Westminster Magistrates’ Court (Kirsty O’Connor/PA)\n\n\n\n\nAt around noon on the day of the incident he was seen by police at the end of the Mall nearest to Buckingham Palace with a camera bag dangling near his ankles.\n\nThe lens of the camera was poking out and pointing upwards, prosecutor Trevor Green told the court, while the rest of the camera was zipped away in the bag.\n\nPolice saw him “up close behind” a woman at that point and followed him as he made his way towards St James’ Park where he was seen filming up another woman’s dress.\n\nSivier was also seen on a grassy area opposite Horse Guards Parade square trying to film under the dress of a woman pushing a pram, the court heard.\n\nMr Green said: “He followed behind her holding out the camera bag trying to film up her skirt.”\n\nHe added: “Whilst under arrest he (Sivier) said ‘I have recordings of upskirts from the Trooping of the Colour’.”\n\nHe was sentenced to eight weeks in jail, suspended for two years and ordered to pay costs totalling £200.\n\nHe was also banned for the next 24 months from having in a public place a camera capable of recording.\n\nMs Smith said she had stopped short of preventing him from having a phone in a public place “given your work and the fact that mobile phones are an essential part of daily life”.\n\nSivier, whose occupation was not given in court, will also be required to do 100 days of the Horizon sex offending programme and 20 days of rehabilitation.\n\nPaul Dillon, mitigating, said Sivier had “difficulty coming to terms with his behaviour”, was embarrassed by what he had done and realised it had put his marriage in jeopardy.\n\nBut he said his client was taking steps to change, including seeing a therapist.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mps would vote on paisleys commons suspension if he resigns to force byelection","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.
