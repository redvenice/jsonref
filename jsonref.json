Cummings, a mercurial and intelligent strategist, stoking the fire of Brexit behind the scenes, with Gove, alongside Boris Johnson, as the public face of the official campaign me, doing all I can to dampen the flames and get people to focus elsewhere.Cumberbatch says he took the Cummings role because of James Graham’s script, but there is no doubt that the master strategist behind Brexit also provides a fascinating character for any actor.Witnessing him in action before the referendum campaign, it was clear Cummings was highly effective at being isive. It was he who characterised the educational establishment as ‘the blob’ and wound up anyone and everyone with his vicious, mischievous and — of course — anonymous outpourings on Twitter.At that time, he was clearly behind a series of briefings against David Cameron. So much so that he and Michael Gove were invited into Number 10 and asked if there was anything he wanted to get off his chest.Cummings, it turned out, wasn’t so willing to criticise the Prime Minister to his face, and my memory of the meeting was of him meekly praising Cameron. Afterwards we wondered where the reckless rebel of folklore had been. After all, this was someone who reportedly used to sign himself into Whitehall meetings under the name Osama bin Laden.At the time, my view of Cummings was summed up by quoting that scene from Monty Python’s Life Of Brian, ‘He’s not the Messiah, he’s just a naughty boy’. The line was changed in the TV version to, ‘He’s not the Messiah. He’s just a f****** a*****le’. So how accurate was the rest of the drama?          The charts the story of the clash of political campaigners, with Cummings directing the Leave campaign and Oliver directing the Remain sideFrom the moment the film was announced, critics of Brexit were worried that having an international superstar like Benedict Cumberbatch playing Cummings would give the man more credence than he deserved. They feared Cummings would be lionised, rather than held to account.At first, I worried too. Surely a star of Cumberbatch’s calibre would create sympathy for a man who should be confronted with tough questions.And the fact is that, having delivered the Brexit vote, Cummings disappeared in a puff of smoke. After setting the fire going, he steadfastly avoided media interviews — and refused to appear in front of a Parliamentary committee to answer difficult questions about data use and dodgy claims during his campaign.Most of my fears were allayed, however, when I visited the film set and saw that Cumberbatch was almost unrecognisable, having shaved his head to create Cummings’ unmistakably sparse thatch and bald forehead. He has not glamorised Cummings, just sort of inhabited him.The first half of James Graham’s sophisticated and thoughtful script is devoted to exploring Cummings, the Machiavellian guru who can connect with, and prey on, people’s fears.He is shown running rings around the likes of Brexiter Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, whose cack-handed attempt to get Cummings fired from the official Leave campaign blew up in his face.But if the first half of the film pays heed to Cummings’ undoubted intelligence, and can be seen as the case for his defence, the second is the case for the prosecution.Johnson and Gove are shown at one point looking perplexed and perturbed as Cummings dances manically in front of his notorious campaign red bus on which he had slapped the deeply misleading message: ‘We send the EU £350 million a week. Let’s fund our NHS instead. Vote Leave.’          James Graham, who wrote Brexit : The Uncivil War, said Cumberbatch wanted to play Dominic Cummings with ‘sympathy and understanding’At this point, the Remain campaign comes into sharp focus, trying to defend an unsatisfactory status quo and complex realities, from immigration to the European Court of Justice, in the face of simple claims that Utopia is just around the corner, if only we can leave the dastardly EU.It shows how Cummings sets about systematically and carelessly unleashing the demons of David Cameron’s nightmares.As for the scenes in which I am portrayed, I watched through splayed fingers, groaning as I saw that Rory Kinnear had captured my mannerisms and tics as I tried to have some time with my children while taking a conference call with David Cameron and Peter Mandelson.Kinnear also captured my sense of despair as I watched anti-Brexit campaigner Bob Geldof flicking V signs at Nigel Farage as they barracked each other during their notorious River Thames confrontation at Westminster, when rival pro-Remain and pro-Brexit flotillas clashed. ‘Is this what we’ve come to?’ I asked.The film shows how the murder of the kind, brave and thoughtful Labour MP Jo Cox stopped the campaign short. A moment to reflect about what things are really worth.I suspect how you judge Brexit: The Uncivil War will depend on whether you are Remain, Leave or simply uncertain. It’s extremely well written, acted, directed and produced.If I have one small criticism, it is that the film focuses too much on the exploitation of data as the reason Leave won, suggesting it was simply clinical brilliance that triumphed, rather than the cynical calculation of Cummings and his team, who were too willing to ride in the slipstream of Nigel Farage as he threw out raw, red meat to his supporters with exaggerated and irresponsible claims. It could also have done more to acknowledge that many of the 17.4 million who voted Leave did so out of anger at Brussels’ arrogance and the billions being paid to the EU.The drama is at its best when it shows Dominic Cummings as a master of disruption and destruction, who struggles to make things work long-term.More than two-and-a-half years after the EU referendum, we’re nowhere near the Brexit Utopia he and the Leave campaign promised.          Cummings, pictured here with Boris Johnson and Michael Gove ran the Vote Leave campaignAt the end of the TV version, Dominic and I meet for a drink. He tells me the hard truth that a new type of politics is coming, ‘One that you can’t control’.I ask him, ‘What’s your edge?’ What has he found to make things any better? He doesn’t have an answer.That meeting never happened. But writer James Graham invents it — legitimately in my view — as a means of summing up the clash of two very different world views: Me – believing the world is complex, muddy and requires compromise Cummings the absolutist who demands creative destruction.In that make-believe conversation, I make the case for ‘a kinder, gentler politics’ — and my fear that it has been lost. That’s exactly what I feel having been through the madness, bitterness and bloodshed of the referendum and its aftermath.I hope the film will serve as a warning that the political class needs to sober up - and focus more on what unites, than what ides us. Respect is due on both sides. And it is my belief that the only way through the current chaos is for Parliament to find a cross-party common ground that finally allows us to move on.As for me and Dominic, I’m more than happy to make that drink a reality. Talk it over. Make the peace – and help put out that fire once and for all.So how about it, Dominic? The drink’s on me.Brexit: The Uncivil War is on Channel 4 at 9pm on Monday, January 7."},{"url":null,"title":"Germanys AfD party say country consider EU exit","story":"    The AfD, which has risen to prominence in a backlash against Angela Merkel (pictured), said the EU had become \u0027undemocratic\u0027 and \u0027occupied by the political classGerman police chief condemns migrants who have \u0027a deep...Hackers leak private data of Angela Merkel and hundreds of...Share this article    Debris in front of an AfD office in Saxony - one of the party\u0027s strongholds - on Thursday night after an explosion which has led to three arrests           Police at the scene of the explosion outside an AfD office.

Yes, we had a pathway, we had many things, that was getting close to being a deal,\u0027 he said. \u0027The problem was that the money was a very small amount of money.\u0027The president said that the $25 billion over 10 years that the legislation appropriated only provided $1 billion up front for his wall and he didn\u0027t want to have to go back to Congress and ask for the money each year. He signaled he wouldn\u0027t sign the bill he seemed to be referring to at the time because it provided a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrant children.

He left without taking questions ten minutes later to the shock and dismay of assembled press.He made sure he had the last word on Friday, giving an impromptu press conference in the Rose Garden on an unseasonably warm winter day. The temperature was 50 degrees Fahrenheit in Washington during the remarks that Trump wore an overcoat to. His vice president, accompanying lawmakers and DHS secretary signaled toward the end that they were cold. Trump offered his jacket to a shivering Nielsen but she declined and rubbed her hands together, instead, as the president forged on with questions.He let House McCarthy and Scalise deliver remarks after Pence and had Nielsen take a question on terrorism. As they were leaving, Pence turned around to tell DailyMail.com that he\u0027d reject a pay raise coming to him as an unintentional effect of the shutdown.Democrats also spoke to press from the president\u0027s driveway, reiterating in their position that they will give him no money for the wall.The White House has repeatedly suggested that Pelsoi would loosen her grip on border wall funding once she was formally named speaker.

But late author James Pope-Hennessy, who interviewed members of the Royal Family, former courtiers and ladies-in-waiting, omitted some of the juiciest — and funniest — material, knowing it would never get past the royal censors.Here, in this extract from his newly-published private jottings, is an extraordinarily detailed account of the few days he spent in 1957 with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor at the converted mill house they had just bought near Paris. It was 21 years since the Duke — Queen Mary’s eldest son — had, as Edward VIII, abdicated the throne in order to marry Wallis Simpson, a orced American socialite.At 12.30, I was at the Gare du Nord (in Paris), where the long blue station wagon (Cadillac) of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor was waiting, with a plump pigeon-shaped English chauffeur, dressed in discreet black with a black rosette in his cap.We drove out through jammed streets to Le Moulin de la Tuilerie, which the Duchess has converted into her Petit Trianon. The car hooted at the wooden door in the gatehouse, and this was opened. We drove to the front door where the liveried butler (French) and an English footman were waiting.I was directed to walk across the sunny courtyard to the French windows of the Duke’s study, a colossal room made from a barn, with great log fires smouldering either end, French windows in the middle, maps of his world tours on the walls, souvenirs and uniform buckles everywhere.

Welsh property developer, 35, lives...Share this article‘This room,’ the Duchess told me, ‘represents the Dook’s life.’The floor is covered with a curious tufted carpet in three shades of green, very fresh and pretty: ‘What a pretty carpet, Duchess I’ve never seen one like it before.’‘Ah call it mah lawn.’The Duke of Windsor is, on first sight, much less small than I had been led to believe he is not at all a manikin, but a well-proportioned human being. Just then his hair was blown out in tufts on either side of his head, and he was looking crumple-faced and wild.          The Duke and Duchess of Windsor standing on stone stepsHe has his father’s eyes, and some, I fancy, of his mannerisms. He was drinking milk for what the Duchess calls ‘that lil’ old ulcer’. I should say she is on the whole a stupid woman, with a small petty brain, immense goodwill and a stern power of concentration.Like her house, she is tremendously American, and specifically Southern — it was like being back in Montgomery, Alabama, without the tree moss.I should therefore be tempted to classify her simply as An American Woman par excellence, were it not for the suspicion that the Duchess is not a woman at all. She is one of the very oddest women I have ever seen.She is flat and angular, and could have been designed for a medieval playing card. The shoulders are small and high the head very, very large, almost monumental the expression is either anticipatory (signalling, ‘I know this is going to be loads of fun, don’t yew?’) or appreciative — the great gig-lamp smile, the wide, wide open eyes, which are so very large and pale and veined, the painted lips and the cannibal teeth.There is one further facial contortion, reserved for speaking of the Queen Mother, which is very unpleasant to behold, and seemed to me akin to frenzy.Her high smooth flat forehead is cloven by a deep vertical line of concentration. Her neck makes her age (61) apparent — a tendency to wattles. Her jawbone is alarming, and from the back you can plainly see it jutting beyond the neck on each side.          James Pope-Hennessy (pictured above) had interviewed many members of the royal household          The couple had visited the Bahamas in 1942 - the Duke of Windsor had served as the Governor there She is wildly good-natured and friendly but with both of them one somehow feels that so much enthusiasm might suddenly gel up and one would be in the limbo reserved for the many, many people who have treated them badly or turned out a disappointment. I like having my jokes laughed at but there’s no need to make the mill-beams rock with appreciation of them.The house itself is full of very pretty colours and ideas and objects. Every conceivable creature comfort is conscripted, to produce a perfection of sybaritic living. They are like people after a cataclysm or a revolution, valiantly making the best of infinite luxury.It is, of course, intensely American, but I would think consciously aimed. The Queen Mother at Clarence House is leading a lodging-house existence compared to this.  James Pope-Hennessy said the couple (pictured above) were not what he had expected them to beMy room in the stables was very pretty and convenient, and prepared or planned by a perfectionist there was nothing on earth that you might conceivably want that wasn’t there — every kind of writing paper, nail file, brush, fruit, ice-water the bathroom loaded with scent bottles like a counter at a bazaar.After pottering in my bedroom, I wandered up the hill past the millstream, attracted by a stream of German oaths. Round the corner of the house I found the Duke, wearing a cerise felt baseball cap. He was jumping about rather wildly, and shouting ‘Jawohl, Jawohl’ and other military German expressions to a troop of French gardeners who were lugging the stone base of a sundial on to its mount.The Duchess, flat against the inside of the drawing room window, was looking on in a disinterested angular way, one hand on the window pane.‘Are the gardeners German?’ I inquired. ‘Well, no — one is Alsatian and one is Spanish, and that lil’ boy is only 14.‘But as the Dook’s German is sort of better than his French, he likes to talk German with them.‘Now I hope you’ll get in your talk with the Dook this afternoon,’ she continued. ‘You must catch him but you’ll find the Dook is kind of a slow starter’ — said with a great wide smile.          The Duke and Duchess of Windsor, sitting in the drawing room of their Paris home, with their four Pug dogs at their feeAbout 3.30pm the Duke came in, sitting on the sofa opposite my chair to talk. The pugs gambolled about — Disraeli, Trooper and Davy Crockett.‘We did have a fourth, called Peter Townsend (the orced Battle of Britain pilot whom Princess Margaret had wanted to marry),’ the Duchess explained with her least nice grin. ‘But we gave the Group Captain away.’ The whole atmosphere was intensely unstrained and unshy, owing, I should say, to the Duchess and the job she has done on the Duke. He talked with complete freedom, even of the delicate subject to which he obliquely refers as ‘1936’.‘My mother (Queen Mary) loathed the country,’ he said. ‘She used to say to me: “I was born in Kensington and I am a Londoner.” She hated Sandringham Balmoral was a bit better but we were always there too long. Sandringham was dreadful.’He added: ‘Off the record, my father (George V) had a most horrible temper. He was foully rude to my mother.‘Why, I’ve often seen her leave the table because he was so rude to her, and we children would all follow her out not when the staff were present, of course, but when we were alone.’I remarked that I was puzzled by the shutting down of his mother’s high spirits after marriage.          King George V with the his Consort, Queen Mary pictured on a visit to Liverpool‘Well, you’re right there, I think. My father was a very repressive influence. I well remember when he used to go banging away for a week or two at some shoot in the Midlands we used to have the most lovely time with her alone — always laughing and joking.‘She was a different human being away from him.’He said suddenly: ‘You realise there are only three completely royal persons alive now? My sister, my brother and myself.’          The Dowager Queen Mary with her son Edward, who abdicated as King in order to marry Wallis Simpson, an American orceeTea was a serious, perfectionist meal, with the Duchess struggling manfully with the teapot (she evidently hates tea, and looks very out of place pouring it out but the Duke drinks, she assured me, cup after cup all day ‘He leaves haff the cup, too, so it gets cold,’ she added.When we got to the drawing room again, the Duchess settled herself on a low wide day-bed, her legs tucked up she does not curl up but somehow dismantles herself, so that she looks like a puppet lying in the wings of a toy theatre.Duchess: ‘We-e-ell, and has the Dook been much help?’          This photo taken in 1937 shows King George VI and Queen Elizabeth with Queen Mary and at the front their children Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret on the balcony at Buckingham Palace, after the Coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey‘Oh, a tremendous help, Duchess I can’t tell you.’Duchess: ‘He was pretty close to his mother, you know. I suppose you’ve had to see everybody about yah book?’ ‘Oh yes,’ I said. ‘The Duke’s sister has been very helpful, and the Queen Mother.’Duchess (in a slightly steely tone): ‘I don’t think the Queen Mother would know about Queen Mary.’ She went on: ‘Just everything happens to me. When I was over in England last, I wanted a new maid so I intervood one who told me she had been five years with the Queen Mother!‘Well, I brought her over here but I had to get rid of her.‘I had a Balenciaga dress with a crinoline. Well, Irene ironed that crinoline so that you couldn’t see what it was by the time she’d finished. I took it back, but even Mr Balenciaga himself couldn’t decide just what she had done to that crinoline.‘And she just burned up five more of my dresses. Well, that surprised me, because I thought that, after all those years with the Queen Mother, if she hadn’t learnt to iron a crinoline, what had she learned?’  Official portrait of Queen Mary (left) in 1935 and another from 1912 (right)‘And, you know, whenever I see pictures of those poor girls (Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret) with their suits all screwed up under the arms, I think of Irene. I’d like to take those girls’ clothes apart and loosen them up.’Before dinner, having had my bath and changed, I was standing by the fireplace in the hall, when the front door flew open and the Duke scampered in, making a yelping noise on seeing me he was wearing red trousers, a fur coat, and a peaked flying cap with fur ear-flaps. He was followed by the valet carrying some clothes.He dashed upstairs. When he came down again, very spick and  in a Balmoral tartan kilt, he smiled with great charm: ‘I say, you saw a pretty quaint apparition just now? Whatever did you think, I wonder? Why they put me into red pants I can’t imagine.’Presently, a tapping of high heels and the creak of stiff silk announced the Duchess, who wound her way down the staircase sheathed in a red-orange very tight, almost hobbled, dress. After dinner, the Duke lugged me off for a preliminary look at his papers, which were in a spare bedroom.A tall white tin filing cabinet, with five or six drawers, stood on a groundsheet at the foot of a green chintz bed. He unlocked it and we sat down side by side on the bed.‘There’s a lot of valuable stuff here, you know,’ he said. ‘Unlike the Duchess, I am very well documented. But I keep them all under years, not under people. Let’s take a look now at 1936.’          The Duke and Duchess of Windsor look lovingly at one another He seized one of the two 1936 files and showed me various letters — until we reached one from Queen Mary, begging him not to broadcast (his abdication speech).‘Surely you might spare yourself this strain and emotion,’ he read out. A look of real disgust crossed over his face.‘She even tried that! Well, I ask you...if I hadn’t done that...’We began to talk about the abdication. ‘People can say what they like for it or against it, I don’t care but one thing is certain: I acted in good faith. And I was treated bloody shabbily.’  Wallis Simpson (left) poses wearing her wedding ring. Queen Mary (right) in an official portrait One random example of this treatment, with which I strongly sympathised, was the fact (attested by receipted bills) that he had produced £4,000 of the £8,000 for the St George’s Chapel monument for his father, Queen Mary paying the other half, and he had not even been invited to the dedication of it nor had it ever been published anywhere that he had contributed.I said: ‘I think one of Queen Mary’s chief difficulties in understanding your dilemma was the fact that she had never been in love herself.’‘No, I don’t think she had,’ he said. ‘You’re right. My mother was a cold woman, a cold woman. And I, you see, I suppose I had never really been in love before. No, I hadn’t. I thought I had, but I hadn’t ever been in love.’  The Duchess of Windsor  (left) pictured at the villa she shares with her husband the Duke of Windsor in 1951. They are pictured together (right) in 1939 after returning from France Before we went back to the drawing room, he said with tired charm: ‘Well, I did my best, you know. I tried to bring the monarchy into touch.’But didn’t George V and Queen Mary start that, with their industrial tours in 1913 and so on?‘In a way they did, but not really. And think of my grandfather (Edward VII).’ His face lit up mischievously and boyishly: ‘Why, look at my grandfather. He’d just sit in an open landau, receive an address, snip a ribbon and declare something open, returning to dine with his girlfriends.

At a cost of $149 (£118), ‘gender neutral’ Woobo comes in teal, pink and violet, but only has one voice option which can be changed in pitch. This allows the child to choose the gender of the toy for themselves.Feng Tan, the firm’s chief executive who has a PhD in robotics, decided to create Woobo after realising most children would love to meet their imaginary friend.The device can also stand in for parents, with features such as playing a voice message to a child when a mother or father cannot get home in time to say goodnight.Critics may dismiss Woobo, designed for four- to eight-year-olds, as another way for parents to palm their children off by sticking them in front of a screen. But its creators claim this is not so.Miss Desai said: ‘It is just about being kid-friendly and kid-safe rather than sticking a mobile phone or a screen in their face, this is an interactive friend they can really bond with.’ It also steps in as a mentor, urging children to think about how they would act in certain situations, such as if a classmate was being bullied or if they did not like a meal at a friend’s house.Privacy concerns are shrugged off, with creators saying that unlike smart speakers, which listen for prompts such as ‘Hey Google’ or ‘Alexa’, Woobo only jumps into action when its ears are touched.The device looks like a normal cuddly toy – but has a screen for a face. It also has sensors on its paws and tummy, reacting to hugs and tickles. The robot, which will be unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week, will be crowned best toy for play and learn in the baby tech awards, chosen by website Babylist.Another launch at the show is a robot pet called Kiki, which teaches skills such as empathy and respect. "},{"url":null,"title":"Thomas Markle urges Meghan Kate rumoured differences aside","story":"    Thomas Markle, (pictured) has had no contact with his daughter since she married Prince Harry, and has said he is \u0027very upset\u0027 by the criticism his 37-year-old daughter is receiving          His comments come amid a rumoured rift between Meghan and Kate (pictured), who is said to have been ‘reduced to tears’ by Meghan’s demands over Princess Charlotte’s bridesmaid gown          The 74-year-old added he is keen for reconciliation and for his daughter (pictured) to contact him.

Gove says a no deal and second referendum would be playing with fire as he urges people to back Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealThe Environment Secretary is particularly concerned about the impact of no deal Britain\u0027s agriculture industry. In an interview with The Times today he stressed that the EU could place tariffs of 40 per cent on meat exports and enact stringent border inspections at Calais.   The huge delays this would cause would, Gove says, cancel out the benefits Britain could reap by leaving the common agricultural policy.  However in Gove\u0027s opinion, there is one thing worse than the prospect of no deal - another Brexit referendum. That is not to say he fears Remain would prevail in a second vote, in fact he is certain that Leave would win by an even bigger margin than in 2016.           Gove says he is certain that Leave would win by an even bigger margin than in 2016 if a another referendum were heldInstead, his fear stems from a belief that holding another vote would bring discord, anger and mistrust to our political climate on a level not seen in generations. People would feel patronized and hoodwinked to the point that they would never forgive today\u0027s politicians. It would even threaten the United Kingdom as it might add legitimacy to Scottish nationalists\u0027 call for another independence referendum, he warns.\u0027A second referendum would be worse than crashing out because of the damage it would do to our democracy,\u0027 he told the Times. \u0027The loss of faith people would have in our political system would be far greater than any other political or economic event in our lifetimes.\u0027Gove says he believes the government should deliver what the people voted for, and besides, organising a second referendum would hugely time consuming. Those who are calling for the so-named People\u0027s Vote have yet to even decide on a question, he points out. So Theresa\u0027s May\u0027s third way is the only viable option. And yet it seems no amount of panic over no deal will frighten the hardcore Brexiteers who prefer it to the Prime Minister\u0027s offering. In the same vein, passionate cries that holding another vote will spell the end of democracy will not persuade hardened Remainers that Britain is obliged to leave.  I\u0027m not a crook, I\u0027m not a liar and I WASN\u0027T forced out:...Thomas Markle urges Meghan and Kate to put their rumoured...Share this articleBut Gove suggests that there is plenty to be optimistic about in Mrs May\u0027s deal. \u0027If we are in the backstop we have tariff-free and quota-free access to the EU market and at the same time we don\u0027t pay a penny for it and we have the capacity to say we can determine what our immigration policy can be, and critically we have access over our territorial waters,\u0027 he enthused to the Times. He concedes that yes, the Prime Minister\u0027s deal is not perfect, but laments people\u0027s tendency to focus on the parts they dislike rather than what has been achieved in the negotiations with Brussels.       Theresa May has won the respect of her Environment secretary over the past year through sheer resilience and determination, and Gove is now a big advocate for her continued leadership Theresa May has won his respect this past year through sheer resilience and determination, Gove says.   By stating that he firmly believes she will be Prime Minister this time next year, he cleverly avoids having to speculate on any behind-the-scenes jostling for the role of her successor. Gove himself took a stab at the top job once before, although he missed the leadership and ended up knifing Boris Johnson. Will he have another go? \u0027I\u0027m not going to go there,\u0027 he told the Times with laugh.   But it seems he is genuinely enjoying his role as Environment Secretary. Since accepting the post in June 2017, he has surprised everyone with his palpable enthusiasm.  Britain has seen an 87 per cent reduction in singe-use plastic bags during his tenure, and he has turned his attention to microbeads, cotton buds and straws.  Even his own personal New Year\u0027s resolution is to further reduce his household\u0027s plastic use. \u0027Britain can lead the way in animal welfare and environmental standards,\u0027 he declared confidently.But Brexit is always lurking in the background. While he wants to press on with his plans for the environment, he finds it infuriating that he has to waste 40 per cent of his time planning for no deal.  \u0027The country wants us to do so much more than just Brexit,\u0027 he sighed.  Michael Gove: ‘If we had a second referendum Leave would win by an even bigger margin’ | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"From punks Mod clashes petrol bombs Toxteth riots","story":"    Among the fascinating black and white photos is this one taken in Chelsea, London, during the summer of 1977.

They’re accustomed to drawing 1 million visitors a month, according to St Thomas.“We go by month, it depends on the weather,” she said. “I think it’s roughly 1 million visitors for all 19 museums for the month of January.”The US Botanic Garden in Washington is also open daily, “having been funded for the fiscal year”, said Devin Dotson, its head of public affairs. “We continue to welcome visitors from across the United States and around the world to explore our collection.”The estimated 2019 budget for all Smithsonian museums is $957m. The funding includes a multi-million dollar roof repair of the Hazy Center, a renovation of thew National Air and Space Museum, funding to fix the ongoing infrastructure at the National Zoo and a renovation of the west wing at the National Museum of American History.In the meantime, the Washington tourism board is trying to shed light on other attractions for culture-seeking visitors like the food scene and live sport (which may or may not satisfy art aficionados).“While we’re disappointed the Smithsonian museums are closed, the vast majority of things for visitors to see and do throughout Washington’s neighborhoods remain open,” said Elliott L Ferguson II, president and CEO of Destination DC. “It’s a great time to find a deal in the city and explore our Michelin-rated dining scene, watch a hockey or basketball game at Capitol One Arena or catch a show at one of the city’s many venues.”Other museums are still open, including the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the Phillips Collection, the Museum of the Bible and National Law Enforcement Museum. The Newseum, a museum devoted to journalism, announced yesterday that they are offering free admission to federal employees during the shutdown.While the National Zoo is closed, the Smithsonian claims “essential personnel” are on site to care for the animals during the shutdown, though they remain closed to the public.Museum-goers remain disappointed by the closure, by what it represents to museum workers and arts administrators.“This administration has made it clear through budget cuts and ignorant tweets that the arts and cultural education are of little value or importance,” said Whitney Bell, a Los Angeles-based artist, writer and founder of a talk series called The Stories Of Women.“Hundreds of thousands of jobs furloughed and millions of Americans left without access to our most important cultural institutions, historic landmarks and influential art, and for what?” she asks.“A xenophobic wall that flies in the face of the melting-pot ideology this country was built on.

Research has found that a quarter of smartphone users never use them to make a voice call.“Calling someone is a bit daunting,” said one 18-year-old respondent in a survey on phone habits conducted by Ofcom. “It’s much easier and quicker to WhatsApp my friends. If I have to call a company, I’ll always try to use webchat if it’s available.”Last year, Ofcom found the average Briton checked their mobile phone every 12 minutes. It also found that, for the first time, the time spent making phone calls from mobiles fell, as users instead used messaging services instead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c655a196ab2027f7f973af55d00867a1c3486af/0_61_2887_1733/master/2887.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5847c5f6e8c581ad0489b4df258fab34","title":"culture nation cities boost london","story":"Some people call for a town of culture award, but smaller communities should be able to benefit too• Phil Redmond is chair of the UK City of Culture independent advisory panel, and a TV screenwriter who created Brookside and HollyoaksAnother year over, a new one just begun, sang one of Liverpool’s great songsmiths. And with each one that passes, a new anniversary is formed. Last year was significant for me, as it was not just the 40th anniversary of Grange Hill but also the 10th anniversary of what will, probably, soon be known as the UK’s one and only European capital of culture.This year will mark a decade since, having seen the impact on Liverpool, I suggested and began shepherding the UK city of culture project. Last week the Labour MP Yvette Cooper suggested there should be a town of culture award to sit alongside it.She was right to identify culture’s catalytic effect. Such titles encourage people to come together collaboratively, using culture to explore common interests and opportunities for change.But these awards are not a panacea. They do not come with any promise of direct funding, only what every city outside London craves: a year of unprecedented media exposure that attracts visitors, alters perceptions and through that builds confidence and aspiration, especially in younger residents. The designation should therefore be seen not as the solution to, or end of, anything, but the start of a new phase in a city’s life and a launchpad for strategic plans.It is up to each recipient to decide what, when, where and how to use funding from supporters such as the BBC, Arts Council England and the Heritage Lottery Fund, while at the same time recognising the responsibility to maximise the potential for participation. Liverpool embraced the Euro-branding, and focused its future civic, political and corporate ambitions on that one year. It attracted 3 million extra visitors, and numbers have remained high – the visitor economy has doubled to about £4bn, dwarfing the annual EU grant of £100m incidentally, and allowing the mayor, Joe Anderson, to claim culture as the rocket fuel of regeneration. I have no doubt a town of culture accolade would be a positive re-energising tool, but the proposal only takes us back to 2009, when the project wrestled with the entry criteria. How big a city or town? Could a county enter? What about joint bids? Eventually a consensus emerged that to achieve the “Liverpool effect” it had to be a recognisable conurbation, but it could be any town or city that could demonstrate local identity and need.In other words, a place had to have a cultural story everyone could understand. The only city excluded, for once, would be London. The primary reason that Derry-Londonderry, Hull and Coventry have succeeded is that their stories were, if not better, then more fully developed than those of others.It is also worth bearing in mind that there have been only three rounds, each one providing a better understanding and opportunity to improve the process. Size and geographical scope are actively under review. As is frequency. Why wait so long between awards? Initially the idea was for an annual award, but that was felt too onerous for the national supporting organisations, as well as, perhaps, diminishing the impact. Would enough cities enter to make it worthwhile? Ten years on, it is clear that the demand is there, and that the cultural landscape has changed. People and places are, like Liverpool, realising that creativity and culture go hand in hand. There is a clear demand to use culture’s catalytic power, just as there is a growing understanding of the role our national organisations, such as Tate and the V\u0026ampA, can play outside the capital.This was articulated well by Perth, St David’s, Wells and Hereford as the “quiet crisis”: smaller places struggling with the same challenges as bigger ones but drowned out by “urban chatter”. Losing the local pub, shop, bank or bus service in a big city or town is an inconvenience elsewhere it can sound a death knell.Nothing is set in stone. The discussion around greater cultural intervention is already live, but we have to be careful not to raise the urban decibel level. The real need is for a broader debate about cultural intervention being used for the many, not the few.• Phil Redmond is chair of the UK City of Culture independent advisory panel, and a TV screenwriter who created Grange Hill, Brookside and Hollyoaks"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0813a6519216efe494de31e70e770e1a2dcfe6f8/0_21_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=252060d929565c59600a8f379fa0cd25","title":"alberta the ultimate seven day drive itinerary","story":"Yearning to hit the open road? Consistently named as one of the most scenic drives in the world, this route from Calgary to Edmonton through the Rockies is hard to beatWith a flourishing bar and dining scene, and a number of erse and arty neighbourhoods, cosmopolitan, multicultural Calgary is much more than just the gateway to the Rockies. Direct flights from London (daily from Heathrow, and multiple times a week from Gatwick) also make it a convenient starting point. Load-up and learn, with a food tour of the historic Inglewood neighbourhood. The tour stops at the high-end Rouge, in what’s now a heritage site, as well as taking in Alberta’s First Nations arts and food culture.Style-up and get your cowboy threads sorted year-round at the Alberta Boot Company, or head to Smithbilt for the distinctive white hats that have become a symbol of the city – so that when the Calgary Stampede rodeo comes to town in July, you look the part.Head for the hills to start your roadtrip. Banff national park – Canada’s oldest – is an easy hour-and-a-half drive from Calgary. But don’t skip the picturesque and vibrant mountain town of Canmore, just outside the park’s boundary, where the peaks of the Rockies provide the backdrop to numerous music and arts festivals throughout the year.For a town with a population of just under 14,000 people, the town is overflowing with dining and drinking destinations. And it also claims the honour of being home to the largest number of Olympians per capita in Canada, who use the altitude to train. (If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.)In the summer, hit the bike trails. A 13-mile trail connects to Banff, with an additional 50 miles of other pathways to follow. In winter, try out one of the newest crazes in these parts: fat biking. Extra-large tyres will take you across otherwise inaccessible snow-covered trails. Don’t fret, there are hand-warmers too. Afterwards, head on to Banff to warm-up at the thermal waters of the Upper Hot Springs.It’s impossible to be bored in Banff with the myriad activities on offer. If you want action and adventure, try white-water rafting, rock climbing and horse riding. If you want to take it easy, just find a patio, order a coffee and sit and watch the clouds move over the mountains that hug the town. If you want something in between, how about a round of golf? Banff has some of the most beautiful courses in the world. You certainly can’t skip town without a fondue from the unironically kitsch Grizzly House.Put simply, Lake Louise doesn’t look real. Its searing blue waters reflect back the towering glacier that created the lake 10,000 years ago. While in the winter the lake freezes over and becomes a fairy-tale setting for ice skaters and sleigh rides, in the summer it’s populated by canoes with travellers keen to glimpse the ice close-up. When you get tired of taking in the views from the genteel-surrounds of the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise – if such a thing is possible – take the steep 2-mile (3.5-km) hike from the hotel to the Disney-esque Lake Agnes Tea House. First built by the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1901 as a shelter for hikers, this lakeshore log cabin sits in a valley of its own, and has been serving tea since 1905.The spectacularly scenic Icefields Parkway hugs hillsides and traces its way past more than 100 ancient glaciers on its 146-mile (235-km) route from Lake Louise to Jasper national park.With dramatic waterfalls and sweeping lakes at nearly every turn, you’re going to want to stop often. Head to the highest point of the parkway to stop at the viewpoint for the glowing turquoise waters of Peyto Lake. And leave time to explore the Columbia Icefield, the largest ice field in the Rocky Mountains. You can tour it in a massive all-terrain vehicle or, if you fancy a bird’s eye view, by helicopter. And at the Glacier Discovery Centre, tours will take you to walk on the up-to-300m thick ice of the Athabasca Glacier.Sweet little Jasper – home to just 4,500 people – has charm. Surrounded by natural beauty, it’s an adventure sports hub, and a key stop for the iconic Rocky Mountaineer train. You’ll be spoiled for choice for places to eat. Papa George’s – a family-run Jasper institution since 1925, offers comfort food, such as fluffy buttermilk pancakes, in a homely environment. Head out of town for one of the great Rocky Mountain experiences – a cruise across Maligne Lake. Here, you’ll find the stunning Spirit Island – its tiny grouping of trees, surrounded by crystal blue water, has made it one of the world’s most photographed beauty spots.Head east from the mountains to the metropolis. Nicknamed “festival city”, Edmonton always has something going on – from music festivals to fringe theatre, to farmers’ markets. Make sure you check out the atmosphere of the historic Old Strathcona, which has plenty of quirky, independent shopping, restaurants and bars. Encompassing more than 90 miles (150km) of multi-use trails and over 20 major city parks, the lush Edmonton River valley is the largest expanse of urban parkland in North America.

It involves pumping water, chemicals and usually sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale – hence the name – and release the gas trapped within to be collected back at the surface.The technology has transformed the US energy landscape in the last decade, owing to the combination of high-volume fracking – 1.5m gallons of water per well, on average – and the relatively modern ability to drill horizontally into shale after a vertical well has been drilled.Several other authorities – including Leeds, Wakefield, Hull and York – have expressed opposition to fracking, and experts believe the stance taken by Manchester and London will embolden others.Many Conservatives are also opposed. In Westminster, almost two dozen Tory MPs are reported to be against fracking and willing to “destroy the government’s majority” if it tries to weaken planning laws.Several Tory-run local authorities – including Derby, Dorset and Nottinghamshire – are fiercely opposed to the change in planning proposals, which would mean companies could drill test sites without applying for planning permission.Manchester’s decision echoes similar policies already pursued by the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales. Scottish government has a shale gas moratorium and the Welsh government has promised to block any applications.Tom Fyans from the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), said Greater Manchester’s policy was a significant moment. “The decision is symbolic of the growing opposition to the government’s plans to fast-track fracking, which look to override local democracy by disregarding the wishes of local communities and deny those very people the opportunity to have their say on decisions that will ultimately affect them and the health of their countryside,” he said.Burnham said: “It’s about embracing the future, not the past. Cities like Greater Manchester need to join the group of leading cities on the world stage that are driving fast towards carbon neutrality.“That is a big challenge and it must be embraced wholeheartedly, and it means a full commitment to renewable energy and not half measures, and not clinging on to processes that hark back to a past.”In London, the city’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, who last month declared a “climate emergency”, has said he will throw out all fracking proposals. His draft London plan, which will be ratified later this year, introduces an effective ban on fracking across the capital.Tony Bosworth of Friends of the Earth said: “It’s not surprising that they are opposed by local councils around the country, including many controlled by the Conservatives. In order to deal with the climate crisis, we need to be moving away from fossil fuels, not making it easier for companies to dig up more.”About 2.6 million people live in Greater Manchester, large parts of which are within “shale-prospective areas” identified by the British Geological Survey and the Oil and Gas Authority. Energy companies have been granted licences to pursue oil and gas exploration in the west and north of the region, with iGas the first to drill a combined coalbed methane and shale gas exploration well in Barton Moss in Salford in 2013-14.The combined authority’s proposals on fracking are part of a wider, more ambitious environmental plan. Manchester city council, one of its10 local authorities, has already agreed to the goal after accepting advice from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. The wider region is expected to follow suit soon.Burnham said the decision to move against fracking came about after council leaders looked at what happened in Lancashire, where fracking started in October at Preston New Road near Blackpool against the will of the local authority after a government intervention. The earthquakes caused by the Cuadrilla activity were a serious concern, Burnham said.“For the legal limits to be breached so regularly is a worry, isn’t it? It’s hard to know what damage is being done and the effect that is having on groundwater and all of those other issues that emerge,” he said.“It’s even more worrying in Greater Manchester, which is a much more urban place, where there is more contaminated land, more mine shafts. This is an industry which hasn’t proven its case. In fact, the opposite.”Burnham accepted that Greater Manchester did not have the power to implement a ban on fracking. “That’s a reflection of government policy and not our policy. We would if we could,” he said. “We are doing what we can within the legal structures that we have got at our disposal.”The policy will be announced on Monday as part of the Greater Manchester spatial framework, which sets out a strategic plan for the city region until 2037. Local leaders have agreed to include concerns about the impacts arising from the exploitation of new sources of hydrocarbons. They believe the government’s support for fracking means there is less of an imperative to invest in new zero-carbon technologies.In September 2018, the petrochemical company Ineos lost a legal challenge against the Scottish government’s position on fracking, when Scotland’s highest court ruled politicians had not exceeded their powers by imposing a moratorium against fracking for oil and gas.Burnham said he was hopeful that energy companies would respect Greater Manchester’s wishes and not apply to frack in the region. “There has never been a legal case involving a spatial framework of this kind. We would be empowering our own communities to take on a government policy which at times seems to impose its will on local communities,” he said.Energy industry analysts have begun to question the economic feasibility of fracking in the UK. Since 2013, gas prices have fallen sharply and there is no shortage of supply in Europe or across the world. German import prices – the standard European benchmark – are half their 2013 level. It is also not yet proven that the substantial shale resources present under the the north of England and elsewhere in the UK can be recovered at a commercially viable volume, as in the US.The government’s determination to press ahead with fracking in light of mounting evidence of climate breakdown has also been criticised by leading scientists. Jim Hansen, known as the father of climate change awareness, accused ministers of ignoring scientific fact.However, the government had defended the practice. A Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said: “Shale gas has the potential to be a new domestic energy source, enhancing our energy security and delivering economic benefits, including the creation of well-paid, quality jobs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8b7b1adeb3846721739d27f3f727c95d537fa50/282_889_3402_2040/master/3402.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=420cf1dd28f96e2a919044a7a33db744","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Rescued turtles, piggybacking toads and a sadly missed rhino feature in this week’s gallery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a70245b8284b9dd166e5c587e7535c39a972c63/0_544_3094_1856/master/3094.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0246815b2c4d37ae1920b28a0b26cbec","title":"bird box reflects a deeply insular conservative and paranoid parenting philosophy","story":"Sandra Bullock’s character is the ultimate tiger mum in film that suggests we are powerless against the horrors of the worldWhen Sandra Bullock’s character in Bird Box tells her two children to “keep running and don’t stop til you get there”, it’s easy to understand director Susanne Bier’s vision for the movie as an allegory for motherhood. But while motherhood is undeniably gritty and challenging at times, it rarely involves literal monsters.In the film, Bullock, the children in her care, and everyone else left on earth, must wear blindfolds to protect themselves from mysterious beings that can decipher their worst fear and then manifest it – catch a glimpse of one, and you either become psychotic or commit suicide.So if the fraught journey Bullock and her two children take down river towards safety represents motherhood, what do the blindfolds mean? Some have made the case that it’s about our desire not to see racial prejudice, others for the pitfalls of social media. What if it’s both of those things, and more?Last week the New York Times published a revealing piece on “the relentlessness of modern parenting”, arguing that the real motivation behind “helicopter” parenting was transcending income inequality: “Raising children has become significantly more time-consuming and expensive, amid a sense that opportunity has grown more elusive.”It’s true – parenting has become increasingly more hectic and competitive in the last 40 years. In an age where meritocracy has been exposed for the myth it is where a “fair go” exists only in private and selective schools in Australia, it is now up to parents, not society, to provide kids with opportunities.Nearly a decade ago, author of Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, Amy Chua was widely condemned for her controversial parenting philosophy but she remained unmoved, telling Time Magazine in 2011, “it’s a tough world out there”.“Keep running and don’t stop til you get there”: Bullock is the ultimate tiger mum in this moment – strict, uncompromising, focused, aggressive – because her children’s lives depend on it. They must remain blindfolded, or they will die. Sure, they cannot see the monsters, but neither can they see life as it is.Are our blindfolds the reason nobody cares about Syria? Or why Americans are no longer paying attention to the longest war in their history? Or that, despite the hammering of alarming statistics for over two decades, we still can’t quite grasp the idea that climate change is so dire we may only have two decades left? When Bullock’s character becomes pregnant, an obstetrician tells her: “Just because you can’t see something doesn’t mean it’s not there.”In this sense, Bird Box reflects a deeply insular, conservative and ultimately paranoid parenting philosophy. There is an invisible evil lurking in the world. One that knows our worst fears, only to exploit them like some all-knowing algorithm – such as global tech corporations harvesting all our personal information, or the government, or both. It knows us. Knows what we like and will turn that against us. In some ways, it already has – the Cambridge Analytica scandal is proof of that.This is the despairing message of Bird Box (and its cinematic sibling, A Quiet Place): we should not try to change the world, for it is monstrous and far too late. We can only look out for our kids and ourselves – and nothing else. It is a message so oppressive, hundreds of memes cropped up after the Netflix premiere, as a kind of scoffing pushback against such a bleak narrative.And it is bleak. Bird Box suggests that all of us – mothers in particular – are not simply powerless against the horrors of the world, but deliberately blind to them. But if parents can look out for their kids, make sure they have an edge, then they can transcend the housing crisis, the rising cost of living, the barriers against social mobility, the evils of racism, poverty, disease and the internet – to become rich and therefore “safe”. And so we bear down on our kids, and tell them to run, blindfolded, and not stop until they get there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a9ded0a6eea9016a8ea5e3207a6ce4cc323ac4d/0_1163_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd28dc0dc2771848cc01c4a1e9695a46","title":"tamal ray gingerbread pudding with caramel sauce recipe","story":"Stave off the January blues with this piping hot pud full of warming spicesChristmas is over.

Make it even if you’re not doing the congee and keep it in the fridge for whenever you need a bit of extra spice on your food.80ml vegetable oil8 spring onions, 6 finely chopped, 2 finely sliced, to serve4cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely minced6 garlic cloves, peeled and finely minced Salt180g short-grain brown rice50g dried shiitake mushrooms, roughly chopped150g rainbow radishes, cut into thin rounds2 tbsp rice-wine vinegar½ tsp caster sugar50g crispy shallots, shop-bought or homemadeFor the rayu1 tsp aleppo chilli flakes (or ½ tsp if using a spicier chilli flake)1½ tbsp sweet pepper flakes1½ tbsp sesame seeds, toasted1 tbsp black sesame seeds, toasted2½ tsp grated tangerine zest2½ tbsp soy saucePut the oil, chopped onions, ginger, garlic and a quarter-teaspoon of salt in a large, high-sided saute pan on a medium heat.

Return half the drained solids to the pan, and put the oil and the rest of the spring onion mixture in a small bowl.In two batches, blitz the rice in a spice grinder or pulse in a food processor, until the grains are broken up. Add the shiitake in two to three batches, and pulse until chopped into roughly 1cm pieces. Tip the rice mix into the spring onion pan and put on a medium-high heat. Add a litre and a half of water, a teaspoon and a quarter of salt, bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to medium and leave to cook for 30 minutes, stirring often, until it’s very well cooked and the consistency of wet porridge.While the rice is cooking, put the radishes in a bowl with the vinegar, sugar and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and leave to pickle lightly.Stir all the rayu ingredients into the bowl with the reserved spring onion and oil mixture.Divide the cooked rice between four bowls and top each portion with rayu. Garnish with the pickled radishes, sliced spring onions and crispy shallots, and serve.This is an epic dish in the best sense of the word. Yes, it takes a bit of effort, both in prep and in beating the chicken and cracked wheat, but the result will surprise, delight and fill you up. The word madrooba hails from the Gulf and translates as “beaten”, after the process of making it. Jareesh is a form of ground wheat that can be found in Middle Eastern stores, but you can also use coarse bulgur wheat. Any leftovers keep well in the fridge and can be reheated another day.1 whole chicken (about 1.4kg)5 onions, 1 peeled and cut into 4 wedges, 2 peeled and finely chopped and 2 peeled and thinly sliced1 head garlic, halved widthways, plus 8 cloves, peeled and crushed2 cinnamon sticksSalt and black pepper165ml olive oil2½cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated4 green chillies, 3 finely chopped seeds and all, 1 thinly sliced1 tbsp ground cinnamon1 tbsp ground cumin1 tbsp ground coriander1½ tsp turmeric7-8 plum tomatoes, coarsely grated and skins discarded (600g net weight)2½ tbsp tomato paste30g coriander leaves, roughly chopped30g parsley leaves, roughly chopped30g dill leaves, roughly chopped300g jareesh or 150g coarse bulgur wheat, washed until the water runs clear2 tbsp lemon juice500g swiss chard, stems discarded and leaves roughly shredded (320g)1½ tsp aleppo chilli flakes (or ¾ tsp if using a spicier variety), to garnishPut the chicken, onion wedges, head of garlic, cinnamon sticks, two litres of water and two teaspoons of salt in a large stockpot for which you have a lid. Bring to a boil on a medium-high heat, skimming off the froth as you go, then turn down the heat to medium-low, cover and leave to simmer gently for 80 minutes, or until the chicken is falling off the bone. Transfer the chicken to a bowl, then roughly pull the meat off the bone, shredding it as you go and discarding the skin, cartilage and bones. Strain the stock into a second pan and discard the solids.Measure out 1.7 litres if you are using jareesh or 1.2 litres if you are using bulgur (save any extra stock for another use). On a medium-high flame, heat four tablespoons of oil in a large, heavy-based cast-iron pot for which you have a lid. Add the chopped onion and fry, stirring occasionally, for 12 minutes, until softened and deeply browned. Add the ginger, chopped chillies and two-thirds of the crushed garlic, cook for another minute, then stir in the spices, tomatoes, tomato paste, two-thirds of the herbs, two and a quarter teaspoons of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook for seven minutes, or until thickened.Add the jareesh or bulgur, shredded chicken and stock, and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to its lowest setting, cover the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, for an hour, or until the liquid has been absorbed and the wheat has cooked through. Off the heat, whisk the mix vigorously for 10 minutes, until it resembles porridge, then stir in the remaining herbs and lemon juice.Meanwhile, heat three tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan on a medium heat. Fry the sliced onion, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes, or until caramelised. Turn the heat to medium-high, add the remaining crushed garlic and cook for one minute. Stir in the chard in batches, add a third of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook for three more minutes, until wilted.To serve, spoon the madrooba into a large, shallow serving bowl. Top with the chard mixture, sliced chilli, remaining four tablespoons of oil and a sprinkling of chilli flakes.Pirão is a traditional dish from the north-east of Brazil made by beating coarse cassava root flour into hot stock. It’s typically eaten alongside a fish stew called moqueca, but I believe it deserves main-dish status in its own right. You can get coarse cassava flour online, and in Brazilian and West African shops (where it’s called gari) failing that, use the same amount of quick-cook polenta.12 raw head‑on, shell-on tiger prawns¼ tsp sweet paprika6 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed105ml olive oilSalt1 onion, peeled and finely chopped 3 tomatoes, finely chopped (300g net weight)1 scotch bonnet chilli, left whole but with a lengthways slit cut into it3 tbsp tomato paste5g coriander leaves, finely chopped, plus 2 tbsp whole leaves, to serve4 sea bream fillets (about 120g each), skinned and cut in half250ml shellfish or fish stock1 green chilli, finely sliced (and deseeded if you prefer less heat) 2 tsp white-wine vinegar150g coarse cassava flour or quick-cook polenta1 lime, cut into wedges, to serveFor the marinated prawns, twist off the prawn heads and put them in a bowl. Leaving the tails intact, peel and discard the prawn shells, then de-vein the prawns and use a small, sharp knife to open them up so they are semi-butterflied. Put the prawns in a medium bowl with the paprika, half the garlic, two tablespoons of oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt. Mix together and leave to marinate for 20 or minutes.Meanwhile, heat three tablespoons of oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan on a medium flame, then fry the prawn heads, stirring, for about five minutes, until crisp and bright pink. Use a potato masher (or metal whisk) to crush the heads and release their liquids and flavour into the oil. Strain through a fine sieve, reserving the oil, and discard the heads.Return the oil to the pan and put on a medium-high heat. Add another tablespoon of oil and the remaining garlic, and fry for a minute, stirring, until lightly coloured. Add the onion, fry for three minutes, then add the tomatoes, scotch bonnet, tomato paste, coriander, fish and a teaspoon and a quarter of salt, and fry for five minutes, stirring every now and then. Pour in the stock and 850ml water, turn down the heat to medium and simmer for 15 minutes.Meanwhile, combine the green chilli and vinegar in a small bowl with an eighth of a teaspoon of salt.Lift out 120g of the fish from the stock and set aside. With the pan still on a medium heat, sprinkle the surface with a third of the cassava flour or polenta, whisking constantly as you go to avoid any lumps. Don’t worry about the fish breaking apart – that’s the intention. Slowly pour in the remaining cassava flour or polenta in two more batches, whisking constantly. Once it’s all fully incorporated into the stock, turn down the heat to low and whisk for eight minutes more, until the mix is thickened and bubbling, then turn off the heat.Put a large, nonstick frying pan on a high heat and, once very hot, lay in the prawns, spaced apart, and sear for 90 seconds on each side, until golden. Scrape the prawn marinade into the pan with the reserved fish, and warm up.Transfer the pirão to a large, shallow bowl and top with the prawns and fish. Toss the remaining coriander with the marinated green chillies, and spoon over the top. Squeeze the lime and drizzle the remaining two tablespoons of oil over, and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e766064766d44d319df91d0d64ea876218e4ef4/0_501_2708_1625/master/2708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e6c0e39b1bb3279f8e4449d30c9b2f0","title":"arsenal barcelona denis suarez transfer january","story":"Arsenal are hopeful of signing Barcelona’s Denis Suárez in the January transfer window.

He has played 221 minutes this season but only 17 of them in the league. The two clubs have opened talks and there is a keenness on both sides to get the deal over the line this month.Arsenal are set to lose Aaron Ramsey on a free transfer in the summer with Juventus favourites to sign the 28-year-old.Southampton are in talks with Sampdoria regarding the potential sale of Manolo Gabbiadini. The two clubs are discussing a loan until the end of the season with an obligation to buy the striker in the summer for a fee in the region of £9m. However, Sampdoria first need to offload another forward, probably Grégoire Defrel or Gianluca Caprari.Gabbiadini, who joined from Napoli for £15m in January 2017, has had an uneven spell at St Mary’s. The striker started his career with a bang, scoring six goals in his first four games, including one against Manchester United in the League Cup final, but his form dipped and has been in and out of the team for the past 18 months.Gabbiadini has one goal in 15 appearances this season and the new Southampton manager, Ralph Hasenhüttl, has not included the 27-year-old in his past five matchday squads."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f5e6c4b1f238f054780492add72960258c05896/45_154_2153_1292/master/2153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8168e0266c02450e05887923fa13f38","title":"manchester united v reading fa cup third round live","story":"There were some other 12.30pm kick-offs in the FA Cup third round today. Here are the results.That’s five wins out of five for Solskjaer. Five shiny bronze centimes for the thoughts of Jose Mourinho. United jet off for some warm-weather training in Dubai, in order to prepare for their trip to Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday. Reading meanwhile take succour from a gusty performance, dusting themselves down for the visit of Nottingham Forest next Saturday.Enough time for Jaakkola to fingertip a long-range Pereira effort around the post, and it’s a routine win for United. The hosts did what they had to do, and they sail comfortably into the fourth round. Championship strugglers Reading played extremely well, but ultimately were too blunt up front to bother Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s second string.90 min: A komik kut at the end, as Rashford, one-on-one with Jaakkola, tries to round the keeper on the right ... then stands on the ball and skitters hysterically out of play for a goal kick. He laughs heartily at his mistake, yet another sign that United are playing with renewed joie de vivre.89 min: Reading pile forward in a desperate attempt to get back into the game. Suddenly Pereira spots Lukaku alone on the halfway line. His long pass forward momentarily looks to set the striker free, but Jaakkola is out quickly to sweep the ball away from danger.86 min: Swift finds space out on the right and curls a cross into the area. Romero is out to claim. The visitors are keeping on, right until the end.84 min: Chong strokes a pass wide right for Dalot, whose looping cross eludes Pereira, ing in for a header, six yards out. There was a slight nudge on Lukaku as the ball came over, and the referee consults VAR, but it’s not enough for a penalty.82 min: Barrow zips down the left and nearly gets past Fellaini in the United box. Nearly, but not quite. Goal kick.81 min: Barrow slips Richards into space down the left. Richards crosses long. Meite, coming in from the right at a tight angle, slams a wild shot deep into the stands from close range. He was offside anyway. But Reading, to their immense credit, haven’t given up.80 min: Swift sends Aluko skittering down the right. Meite is free in acres in the middle, but Aluko can’t find the space to loop the ball across, and runs it out of play.78 min: Good work by Rinomhota down the right, nipping past Jones with ease, the United defender charging out recklessly. But his cross is well cleared by Dalot with Reading forwards waiting to pounce.77 min: To a chorus of pantomime boos, Chong is booked for a light but cynical clip on Richards.76 min: Reading make their final change, swapping Harriott for Meite.75 min: Reading press United back in their final third, Aluko, Barrow and Rinomhota stroking it around, probing hither and yon. But they can’t find the killer pass.72 min: Barrow bowls down the left, then slips a pass inside for Aluko, who clips a first-time shot towards the bottom left from the edge of the box. Romero tips round for a corner. From the set piece, Yiadom’s shot hits McTominay on the shoulder. Reading want a penalty, but they’re never getting it. Another corner instead, which comes to nothing.70 min: Aluko drives at United but the door is slammed shut. United break upfield, Lukaku slipping a ball wide right to Chong, who is fast but can’t get on the end of that. The Old Trafford faithful certainly are excited by the promise of Chong, a huge roar going up as he’s in hot pursuit.68 min: Young hoicks a free kick into the Reading box from the left. Lukaku can’t get a header on target. Then another wave, as Rashford bursts into the area from the left, but he’s crowded out. Finally a third go, as Young dribbles in from the left and slips a ball inside for Fellaini, who tries to back-flick into the net from close range. No Lee Sharpe he.66 min: Nothing going on, so BT Sport show footage of Sanchez sitting in Solskjaer’s seat in the dugout, and being told to move in short order.64 min: Sanchez departs with a frown, as Rashford comes on in his stead.63 min: Typical timing: Sanchez has pulled up, and has indicated that he needs to come off.61 min: Reading make their second change, swapping McCleary for Barrow. Meanwhile United make a double substitution: Mata and Fred are replaced by Fellaini and the 19-year-old winger Tahith Chong.59 min: McCleary makes good ground down the left with some ball-on-string entertainment. He flicks a pass down the channel to release Loader into the box, but the Reading forward has foolishly wandered offside. A needless mistake with United once again looking vulnerable in defence.57 min: A bit of a lull. United don’t really need to move up the gears, so this is where we are.55 min: Now it’s Reading’s turn to escape. A long ball down the United left. Lukaku cushions a header down for Sanchez, who can’t get a shot away. Yiadom should clear, but he allows Lukaku to barge him off the ball, to the left of goal. Lukaku sets up Mata, whose first-time swipe hits Moore. 53 min: Aluko jinks his way across the front of the United box, right to left. Then he suddenly checks and plays a cute straight pass to Harriott, who is free on the penalty spot! He has to score, but batters straight at Romero. United escape.52 min: Dalot and Mata play a long-distance one-two down the right. Dalot dinks one into the centre but Lukaku is on the back foot. Mata tries a cross from the left but it’s too deep. The first signs of United flickering to life in this second half, though.50 min: Kelly takes a shot from the best part of 40 yards. Full marks for ambition.49 min: Darmian clatters into the back of Loader, who was in the process of turning him down the inside-left channel, 25 yards from goal. A free kick in a dangerous area. Swift takes, sending one over the wall and dipping towards the bottom right. Romero reads it well and snaffles the catch.47 min: Harriott dribbles down the middle of the park and flicks a pass to his left for Loader. It doesn’t quite come off, but United were once again light at the back there.46 min: McClearly and Loader work the ball down the right. The ball’s teed up for Swift, who blazes over from distance. Reading have obviously come out swinging, with nothing to lose. A fair chance, one way or the other, that this won’t end 2-0.The second half is underway. United get the ball rolling again. Reading have made a change, with the injured Ilori replaced by the forward-thinking Aluko. Rinomhota moves to right back, with Yiadom moving into the centre of defence.Half-time entertainment. This is delightful. Please don’t get too lost in nostalgic reverie, and remember to come back for the second half.Reading have been excellent. But United have been clinical. The hosts have one foot in the fourth round.Just as Reading were threatening to equalise, United break upfield. Sanchez threads a pass down the inside left to release Lukaku, who rounds Jaakkola on the outside and rolls home.45 min +3: Harriott has a whack this time from his beat out on the right. It’s blocked. But then Yiadom spins Jones with the greatest of ease, down the inside right. He slams a shot towards the top right it’s parried round the post for a corner that comes to nothing. 45 min +2: Swift has been Reading’s chief creative force, and here he sends a stunning crossfield pass to Harriott out on the right. Not for the first time, there’s a lot of space out there. Not for the first time, Harriott doesn’t do anything with the opportunity.45 min: There will be five added minutes, a combination of the Ilori injury and the VAR exercise.44 min: Swift robs Pereira, 35 yards out, and feeds Harriott down the right. Harriott opens his body and looks to pass the ball into the bottom right, but his shot is weak and easily snaffled by Romero.43 min: Young hauls down Harriott in the middle of the park. For some reason the referee gives Sanchez a lecture instead. This half is petering out.41 min: Yiadom bursts past Sanchez down the right. There’s not much in it, but the referee blows for a United free kick. Just as well for the hosts, because Yiadom was yomping into the area. Yiadom loses the place completely, throwing semaphore shapes in disgust. He suddenly remembers he’s on a booking and calms down quicksmart.40 min: Space for McCleary down on the right. He hooks into the box for Loader, but Darmian and Jones crowd out the Reading striker.37 min: Fred looks industrious and impressive. He sends Lukaku trotting into the Reading half with a quick forward thrust. Lukaku feeds Sanchez on his left. Sanchez dribbles into the box with great purpose, but he’s shepherded away from danger by Ilori, and Jaakkola then hacks away from danger while down on his knees.35 min: United’s defence is all over the shop, offering up plenty of chances. But Reading aren’t taking them. Twice in the space of a minute, there’s oodles of room for Harriott, then Loader, down the inside-right channel. But both young Reading forwards hesitate when they should drive forward to trouble Romero."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb0c1c6219abf70c4ec38b5cc0b2a530ab0f4393/0_508_3409_2045/master/3409.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d37f073e5cf2feba15e75d037efe75bd","title":"how we live together the homeowner and the refugee","story":"‘He’s now a member of the family and I’ve got back so much more than I’ve given’Like many people, my husband and I saw what was happening in Calais and felt a need to do something.

It’s easier than you thinkWhile we may not be able to remove all these challenges, we can pass on skills to help young people cope with stress and adversity. “It’s what’s known as resilience,” Saddleton says. “The ability to overcome difficult experiences and be shaped positively by them.” Our brains respond to the information around us, so resilience can be taught, modelled and nurtured at any age. “By doing this, through strong support networks and encouraging communication, we can help young people understand when they feel down and know what they can do to make themselves feel better,” she adds.As a parent myself – I have a son of eight and a daughter of six – it’s something that’s high on my agenda, and I’ve discovered some effective techniques. Crucially, they don’t require you to overhaul your parenting style, but simply to make a few tweaks that will help your children thrive.I have a full-on job, two school-age children, and an elderly mother to care for, so I understand that we’re all busy I’m not trying to pile on the guilt. But I’ll never forget what my daughter, then four, said one day. We were working on a jigsaw, but I kept nipping to the kitchen to check my phone. When I rejoined her for the third or fourth time, she rightly observed, “Daddy, you’re not really here, are you?”Resilience comes from relationships children need nurturing. It’s not a magical “inner strength” that helps kids through tough times instead, it’s the reliable presence of one, supportive relationship, be it parent, teacher, relative, family friend or healthcare practitioner. My key point is, it’s quality, not quantity, that counts. Ten minutes of fully focused attention is better than an hour when your mind is on other things. If you’re on your tablet at the dinner table, you’re teaching them it’s OK to always be distracted. And that they are not important enough for your sole attention.One-on-one time doesn’t have to be time carved out of an already hectic schedule. Make bathtime, car journeys, meals, queues count. Chat, listen, talk about your feelings, encourage them to express theirs. Once these one-to-ones become regular, your children will know they always have a safe space to open up.I see so many children who are struggling to sleep, waking tired, with dark circles under their eyes. A lack of good-quality sleep is a huge driver for stress: it has a negative effect on memory, concentration, cognitive function, and decision-making.One of the fastest ways to improve sleep – for all of us – is to limit screen time before bed. The type of blue light emitted by digital devices suppresses production of melatonin, the hormone that signals to the body it’s time for sleep. In addition, looking at screens before bed keeps us emotionally wired and stimulated, making it harder for us to switch off.It’s a steely parent who can ban tech completely, and I don’t think you need to. But I would urge you to issue a household ban on devices at least an hour before bedtime. Turn off the wifi, if need be. (TV isn’t so bad if you need that as a compromise we tend not to sit as close to the screen.)Earlier in the evening, insist everyone uses “night-time mode” on their devices, which swaps the blue light for a warmer glow. You can download apps that do this (such as f:lux), too, or buy blue-light-cancelling glasses. It’s also worth switching your children’s night lights to red ones – red has the least impact on melatonin production. When I did this in my children’s rooms, they slept in more than an hour later the next morning.We all know that regular activity is important, and that most of us, children included, need to do more of it. But what if I told you that, as well as keeping them physically fit, exercise will increase your child’s resilience? It actually strengthens the brain.It’s well documented that exercise is on a par with medication when it comes to treating mild to moderate depression and anxiety. This could be because it gets the body used to moving more fluidly in and out of the stress state. The same hormones released when we’re stressed (cortisol and adrenaline) are raised temporarily when we exercise. Regular physical activity teaches our stress-response system to recover more efficiently.It can be a lot of fun to do this together, and I’ve learned that kids do what they see us doing, not what we tell them to. I’m a big fan of “movement snacking” – short bursts of exercise throughout the day. I’ll put on the radio before dinner and we’ll all dance around in the kitchen. Or my kids will join me doing squats, star jumps, bear crawls or frog hops. The sillier I look, the more they seem to enjoy it.Resilience means understanding you can’t always have what you want as soon as you want it. It’s an important concept to pass on in the age of Amazon Prime, Spotify, Netflix and Uber. Psychology teaches us that people who can accept delayed gratification lead happier, healthier lives. Without the ability to defer pleasure and reward, our kids are losing an important skill for their wellbeing.One of the best ways to teach it? Playing board games. These require impulse control, turn-taking, and mental flexibility. They exercise the prefrontal cortex, the rational part of the brain involved in decision-making, emotional regulation and, yes, resilience. Board games are also a good way for you to model resilience by being a good loser.But there are no shortage of other ways to encourage delayed gratification: learning a musical instrument listening to whole albums instead of skipping from track to track online mastering a new sport even watching a TV series together week by week, instead of bingeing in a couple of sittings.Nutrition has a significant impact on mental health. Good-quality food changes the composition of our gut bugs, which helps send calm signals to the brain. Poor-quality, highly processed food sends stress signals instead. A erse diet, rich in fibre, will lead to greater ersity in our gut bugs, which in turn will help make us more resilient, and anxiety and depression less likely. Persuading kids to eat more healthily can feel like an uphill battle, though, especially if they’re fussy, so this is not about becoming a top chef – just trying a few tricks that can really benefit them emotionally.I like to challenge the whole family to “eat the alphabet” over 30 days. I think it’s a realistic goal to consume 26 different plant foods in a month: A for asparagus, B for banana, C for chickpeas, and so on. It turns healthy eating into a game, and encourages children to try new foods. Turn it into a competition and see who can tick off all the letters first.Instead of pestering your children with questions such as, “How was school?” and, “What did you do today?”, teach them to reframe their day.The following is a game I learned from a friend, who played it with his daughter over dinner. Everyone must answer three questions:1) What did someone do today to make you happy?2) What did you do to make someone else happy?3) What have you learned today?I love this simple exercise for how it helps us all find the positive in every day. It teaches gratitude, nurtures optimism, and recognises kindness. It doesn’t matter what may have happened at work or school, or how stressed any of us may have felt when we sat down at the table the whole mood seems to lift once we’ve played this game. I learn things about my kids that they’d probably never have thought to tell me otherwise. Try it.

It didn’t sound to me like the hardest part of being a writer, but I suppose I imagined having to do it only once per spouse.“Must be nice, staring into space all day,” my wife says.She has just walked into the kitchen, where I am leaning against the oven, coffee in one hand, mouth ajar, watching dust motes filter through a shaft of watery winter sunlight. It is 9.30am.“It’s OK,” I say.“Having a late start, are we?” she asks.“No,” I say, pointing towards my office shed. “But it’s cold out there, so I’m in here.”My wife pulls the bag from the recycling bin, ties a knot at the top and drops it at my feet. “If you haven’t got anything to do,” she says.“I’ve got loads to do, actually,” I say. “The work is really piling up.”“Then why are you in here not working?” she says.“I’m sure we’ve been through this,” I reply. “The hardest part of being a writer thing?”“I expect the hardest part must be standing around watching your wife do everything while you do nothing,” she says.“That’s not the exact quotation,” I say. “And you’re sort of missing the point of the…”“Imagine having to work and also keep this house in some kind of vague order,” my wife says. “Imagine how hard that would be.”“I remember having this exact conversation, like, months ago,” I reply.I return to my shed. The heater has been on for a while, so it has warmed up a little, but nowhere near enough. After half an hour of sitting still, my fingers begin to go numb. I can feel the chill of the floor through my shoes. I lean back in my chair and look out across the garden towards the kitchen. It’s empty.There is a fair chance that my wife has gone out somewhere, but there is also an equal chance that she will be sitting at her desk when I lean around the sitting room door to check, and that if she sees me lurking in the house again, she will make me go to the dump.I cross the garden, quietly ease open the kitchen door and listen: silence.I creep down the hall and hold my breath as I lean around the sitting room door: my wife’s desk is unoccupied.I exhale and sit down in her chair, which is newer than mine and swivels freely. It’s also much warmer in here, and the light catches the floating dust in a most peculiar way. I feel my lower lip drop. The world retreats.A minute or five later, the doorbell rings. The young man on the doorstep is wearing a small hat and a large rucksack. He hands me a laminated card.“I take it you’re the man of the house,” he says.“Well,” I say, “that’s one way of…”“I’m a recently released ex-offender,” he says. “Don’t be put off – I’ve made some mistakes in my life and I’m trying to get back on the right path.”I know he’s lying. And I know that the laminated card with “Work Creation” written on it is a crappy forgery, and that the rehabilitation programme he describes does not exist. In a moment he will to try to sell me a £10 tea towel. Then I recall that the last man I encountered under the auspices of this scam shat on my doorstep when I refused to buy a lint roller.“So what I’m asking today is for you to spare five minutes of your time to let me show you what I’ve…”“Sorry,” I say, “but I’m working.”His patter ceases. The young man glares at me with something like hate in his eyes, but also disbelief. He might have seen me through the window on his way up the path – with my mouth open and staring at the dust.He continues to glare over his shoulder as he retreats. We’re both thinking the same thing – that it’s hard to fool a fraudster.“I’m really very busy,” I say, shutting the door."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dba674270fb49ee3029ea6ba1b346590a484363/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc5f335c21eb8c1de8c132aaa3ec5a14","title":"winter flowering plants alys fowler","story":"When it’s cold and gloomy outside, let’s hear it for plants that flower in the depth of winterIt seems so vulnerable to bloom in these darkest of days, with the thinnest of sun rays to warm your nectar, and to do so naked, without the shelter of leaves, too: all that energy needed to flower, and borne on just a few bare twigs. There are not many plants that do, but those that choose to bear their flowers in the depth of winter are to be prized.If you’re going to brave winter frosts and flower, shelter (as well as the promise of winter sun) is needed. In many smaller gardens, the ideal spot is against the house, where plants will benefit from the wall’s warmth (in summer, they will offer a pleasing green foil).There’s Edgworthia chrysantha, with its pom-pom like clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that seduce both you and the bees with their heady scent. The unopened flower buds are covered in white hairs, making them appear dusted by frost, but with a little sun, they soon open their perfumed doors for pollination. It’s a common trick, in winter, for very early spring flowers to put all their energy into perfume, so that those brave, winter-flying bumbles and solitary bees will come. E. chrysantha needs good, fertile soil with the addition of leaf mould and well-rotted compost every autumn.Another ine-smelling creature is wintersweet, Chimonanthus praecox, which crowns its naked stems in tiny, translucent, waxy, sulphur-yellow flowers that are stained purple inside. Their scent is heady, sweet and distinctly spicy. They are notoriously slow to bloom, taking several years to settle in, but the rewards are everything. Take a few branches indoors and let the warmth of your home be enveloped in their deliciousness. They can be loosely fan-trained against a wall though if it’s a sunny summer, make sure their feet are kept damp with a thick layer of mulch.Stachyurus praecox is often overlooked, because it fails to produce any notable scent, but what it lacks in fragrance, it makes up for in flower. From a distance, these appear to be catkins, but up close, the stiff, pendant flower spikes are covered in creamy, white bells that contrast with the red growth of the new stems. By spring, the whole majesty starts to vanish into the background as its leaves unfurl if you need a little more show, there’s a variegated form, ‘Magpie’, with creamy white margins that are tinged pink.Stachyurus can easily be trained into a fan shape to grow on a wall. It’s also very happy in sheltered shade, making it a useful one for that gloomy side return by the back door."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/905f3c4bc08441e7a4d90829637ee8a738d3b019/5_189_5704_3421/master/5704.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41fa387e935e0a4da68e58d05b6f8ac7","title":"yoga 14 years what got me hooked","story":"Yoga made me feel strong and flexible, two things I had never before felt in my life, physically or metaphoricallyIt is traditional in January for newspapers to run articles about diet and health, so I thought I would write about the healthy subject of physical exercise and my long-running unhealthy relationship with it. There are two ways to be unhealthy about exercise: you can avoid it, or you can be obsessive about it. And because I’m the kind of person who likes to do things properly, in my life I’ve covered both bases.As a kid, I loathed PE, and I used to tell myself that was because I simply didn’t enjoy it. In reality, it was because I wasn’t good at it and, as a precocious perfectionist, if I couldn’t do something well, I simply wouldn’t do it. Some of my most vivid memories from school involve PE teachers singling me out and making me runhit a balljump to show the rest of the class how not to do it.I was the “before” photo of PE, while my athletic best friend was invariably the “after”. Thus began the long years of increasingly elaborate lies (“A lot of 11-year-olds get three periods a month”) in order to avoid exercise. Then I turned 13 and suddenly became obsessed with being skinny. Exercise no longer seemed a problem but a solution to a problem that didn’t actually exist. I went to aerobics classes at the gym on our local high street, where I was about a third of the age of everyone else I sometimes wonder if any of them thought it odd that a little girl who didn’t even need a bra was in a bums, tums and thighs class. Daily, I would do hundreds of sit-ups and star jumps in my room, making the whole house shake with my newfound athleticism, high on the idea of how many calories I was burning. This went on for years, and I guess you could say I was finally getting something out of exercise, though I wouldn’t describe it as beneficial.When I finally shook that in my early 20s, I reverted to my default position of avoiding exercise in the (not unreasonable) belief that a recovering anorexic couldn’t be trusted with it, any more than an alcoholic should sniff a bottle of whisky. But the real problem was I had never learned to think of exercise as something one might do simply because it’s fun: either it had to be for an end goal (being thin), or you had to be good at it. If you’re bad at something, it couldn’t ever be enjoyable, right? But at some point in my mid-20s I realised that I needed to do something other than sit in a chair all day, so I asked a friend for advice. “Have you tried yoga?” she asked.In the US and UK, yoga has an extremely annoying image – one of thin women with long, lean limbs, who subsist on seaweed salad and oat milk. It’s exercise for Gwyneth Paltrow wannabes. And precisely because of that image, I signed up immediately, because while I was no longer doing sit-ups in my bedroom, some deluded fantasies take longer to die and mental illness is tenacious.So I went to my first yoga lesson and quickly realised that I did not have a natural gift for it. I despaired at my inflexibility, my wonkily-shaped feet, my terror of going upside down. I was easily the worst in the class. Even the overweight 60-year-old men who had come on doctor’s orders were better than me.And yet I kept going, twice a week, every week. It would be a lie to claim there wasn’t, initially, an obsessive element to this. But at a certain point I realised that, actually, yoga doesn’t make you thin. Not even the dynamic classes I go to (because the slow classes literally send me to sleep). But yoga made me feel strong and flexible, two things I had never before felt in my life, physically or metaphorically. And so I continued to go.I’ve now been doing yoga for, I think, 14 years and lest any images of me doing elegant backbends are dancing through your head, let me reassure you, I am still terrible. While everyone in my class is springing effortlessly into a handstand, I remain stubbornly grounded. But I don’t care. My ludicrously patient teacher (namaste, Stewart Gilchrist at East London School of Yoga!) ensures I make just enough progress every week to stay excited (I can touch my toes! I’m basically an Olympian!). He never singles me out as an example of how not to do something, even though I am, and he reassures me that just because something is hard it doesn’t mean you can’t do it. After all, he says, you learn how to do something only by making mistakes no one is judging you but you. These are lessons that I have – as yoga teachers say – “taken off my mat” and applied to my daily life.That I make time every week to do exercise that (a) won’t make me thinner and (b) I’m embarrassingly bad at, is as shocking to me as the fact I can now eat for pleasure. The two are linked, of course, and maybe I would have got here eventually anyway. But yoga helped me on my way. And for that reason I will always be grateful to it, Gwyneth schmyneth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15e5c676c351a15f2ec27eb71c47bff4c9a96ee8/0_558_6958_4174/master/6958.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47e76488d8514391787e5add23f7233e","title":"five ways to make a girl band","story":"Peter Loraine, who came up with the Spice Girls nicknames, helped create Girls Aloud and managed the Saturdays, talks girl-group chemistryHow is your girl band knowledge? You can probably tell your Spice Girls from your Girls Alouds, your Pussycat Dolls from your Destiny’s Childs, and, if pushed, you could name all six former Sugababes employees and possibly hum a Little Mix album track, right? To be honest, it doesn’t matter because you’ll never know as much about the glorious pop staple that is a good girl band as Peter Loraine. Remember Sporty, Posh, Baby, Ginger and Scary? Loraine helped create those iconic nicknames as editor of Top of the Pops magazine in 1996. Then, once he’d finished accidentally branding one of pop’s biggest phenomenons, he helped create Girls Aloud, working with them from Popstars: The Rivals in 2002 to that fateful breakup tweet in 2013. He also auditioned and later managed the Saturdays, before working on the recent All Saints and Bananarama reunions. He currently manages new girl band, Four of Diamonds.So who better to ask for advice about what makes the perfect girl band than a man who has dedicated his life to them? Here’s Peter Loraine’s five-point guide to pop perfection …1. You need a gobby one“You need a mouth, as in a ringleader, a spokesperson, somebody who’s happy to say: ‘Shut the fuck up, Lily Allen.’ Good humour. Really important not to take yourselves too seriously, especially in a world of social media because it really doesn’t matter who you are or what you do, there’s always a handful of people that are haters. So you’ve got to have a thick skin and ideally have a laugh at the comments if you can. I think where it’s particularly successful is if they have an idea in their own heads of how’d they like to be perceived and how they’d like to look, because when it comes from them it makes a difference. People can tell.”3. Get a good stylist, please“A bad stylist can kill it. You’d never get away with a Spice Girls thing now because no one would believe it. If you’ve got one that likes to dress really girly, and another who only wears jeans and tracksuit tops, that’s just going to look like a mess now. But you don’t want them all to look the same either because then it looks manufactured. It’s about how you can take what’s in the inidual girls’ heads, find a continuity, but then make it more than what you could buy if you just went into River Island.”4. You need chemistry, not competition winners“Chemistry is so important. I use this analogy often: if you have a day job and you work in Marks \u0026amp Spencer, you don’t get to choose who you work with, but you can take it or leave it. There will be some people you like and some you don’t like. For a band that have been auditioned and put together, like Girls Aloud were, the chances of finding girls that are all going to get on to the point where they can spend 24 hours a day with each other for years is rare. There have been cases where it’s like: ‘She’s amazing, but this group won’t see it past the end of year one if we put her in because she will cause so much trouble with the others.’ We’ve had to say no before, because we couldn’t risk it.5. You need a properly amazing tune“If you’ve got a good song you get the opportunity for the rest to cut through. There’s so much music out there now, but there are fewer TV shows, fewer pop mags, it’s harder to get radio’s attention. The volume of what is out there is colossal so it’s about making an impact with the song and then it’s: ‘Hey, they look great’ and, ‘Hey, I read a bit about them and they’re really interesting.’ It’s not about selling 10,000 singles in the shops and getting in the charts and then getting on the telly. If we were to release a new song with the Saturdays now it would be weird because everything’s changed. There’s no six-week lead-in times. Now, you start putting a song up on streaming and then you take it from there.”Four of Diamonds’ new single Blind is out now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e0f0f60d130e8c0762d1e7f774567f040f0f01c/0_142_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9ee9495722e3f0329c8970ccd0153d6","title":"brexit ferry firm who are the old sea dogs behind venture","story":"Seaborne Freight has been given a £14m government contract but who are the ‘old sea dogs’ behind the venture?Its ranks include a shotgun-toting former veal exporter, a retired submarine officer and a lawyer specialising in insuring class actions. While the men behind Seaborne Freight might not have expected the level of scrutiny to which they are being subjected after landing a £14m government contract to ensure the flow of food and medical supplies in the event of a no-deal Brexit, what started life as another cross-Channel ferry service is suddenly in the spotlight.First came the revelation that the company had no ships. Next, it emerged terms and conditions on its website appeared to be intended for a food delivery business. Now, after dredging started on Thursday to prepare Ramsgate harbour for the service that Seaborne will run to the Belgian port of Ostend, the role of the self-described “old sea dogs” will be closely watched.Seaborne’s founder and chief operating officer is a veteran of the ferry industry and was involved in the controversial export of live cattle from the West Sussex port of Shoreham-by-Sea in the 1990s.Dudley, 64, a well-known figure in the Brighton area, was a director of International Trader’s Ferry, although a listing on Companies House features a different spelling of his name, Dydley. ITF, registered in 1995 in the British Virgin Islands, was formed by cattle farmers with the help of Dudley’s expertise as a “shipping consultant”, according to Companies House. Its plan was to export live calves to the continent to be slaughtered for veal.The trade was the subject of protests from animal rights campaigners, forcing local police to draft in more than 1,000 extra officers to enable the exports, which were legal, to continue. One protester was killed during clashes with police.So fraught was that period that Dudley even borrowed a shotgun to ward off protesters – and found himself imprisoned for two months for possessing it after police searched his home. A judge at Hove crown court told him: “This is not the wild west.”He said Seaborne had no plans to carry livestock out of Ramsgate.Eventually, the police withdrew their provision of security because of the high cost of protecting ITF. The company launched a lawsuit designed to reverse the decision and ensure continued protection at taxpayers’ expense, but was unsuccessful.As protests at Shoreham continued, ITF moved its export operation to Dover, but eventually fell victim to the BSE outbreak. The crisis brought an end to the export of cows from Britain to the continent from 1996, a ban that was not lifted until 2006.Dudley, who is believed to live in Dieppe, France, subsequently worked for MyFerryLink, a small cross-Channel service that was owned by Eurotunnel, as its freight and marketing manager.Speaking to Reuters in December, Dudley said: “For us, the harder the Brexit the better. If Dover and the Channel tunnel are encumbered, our space will go quite quickly.”The chief executive of Seaborne Freight is listed on the firm’s Companies House page as John Sharp, but told the  he had been known as Ben for most of his life, including by his family.He spent 10 years as a submarine officer in the Royal Navy before setting up a shipping company that ultimately ran aground. Mercator, a ship chartering company, was forced into liquidation by HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs in 2014 because it was unable to pay a sizeable tax bill. It was not disclosed how much Mercator owed HMRC, but it left a total of £1.78m in unpaid debts. Sharp said Mercator collapsed after a client in the Middle East failed to pay its bills.He later set up another ship operating company, Albany Shipping, but he said this business was put to one side after he was asked to get involved with Seaborne Freight.After details of Seaborne’s contract emerged, Sharp, 61, said he was confident the company would be ready to run a ferry service from Ramsgate to Ostend by the end of March. Described in the shipping media as a veteran of the ferry industry, he began his career with the marine operations of the French state-owned rail company SNCF and was the chief executive of Seaborne before Sharp joined. According to Companies House, he remains a director of the company and lives in France.Like Dudley, he used to work for MyFerryLink. The business, which operated two ships, was sold to rival DFDS in 2017 amid a monopoly investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority into whether Eurotunnel should be allowed to run cross-Channel ships.Other directors in the company include Peter Hampton Blackmore, a solicitor, and Brian Raincock, an insurance consultant and a director in Albany Shipping alongside Sharp. Both Raincock and Blackmore work for London-based LML, which funds and insures group litigation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9c773fd9728290a0d53284bf4b7401dc2aec48e/0_21_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb2313f1dc17823d7b28c40b2d71b297","title":"may to begin fresh round of brexit phone talks with eu leaders","story":"No 10 refuses to provide details of call, with PM battling to obtain assurances on backstopTheresa May has spoken to Jean-Claude Juncker as part of her effort to obtain further written reassurances that the Irish border backstop in her Brexit deal would never come into force.The phone call between the prime minister and the European commission president on Friday was described by Brussels as “friendly” but Downing Street refused to provide any further details, as May struggles to break the Brexit impasse.She is still hoping to obtain additional clarifications over the backstop before MPs vote on the deal in the week of 14 January, although it is not clear what May can get that would satisfy Tory rebels and the Democratic Unionist party.A backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal. As a result, the EU insists on having its own backstop - the backstop to the backstop - which would mean Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, which props up her government. That prompted May to propose a country-wide alternative in which the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the customs union after Brexit. “The EU still requires a ‘backstop to the backstop’ – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,” May told MPs. Raising the stakes, the prime minister said the EU’s insistence amounted to a threat to the constitution of the UK: “We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom,” she added.Expectations are being kept deliberately low, and May is likely to begin the political year talking about the long-term future of the NHS on BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.May has recently spoken to the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. The discussions were initially confirmed by the offices of Tusk and Merkel. No 10 will not otherwise say who the prime minister has spoken to, unless the counterpart does so first.A European commission spokeswoman described the call between Juncker and May as friendly” and said they “agreed to stay in touch next week” when Westminster returns from its Christmas break and the debate on the meaningful vote will restart.The Commons will discuss May’s Brexit deal on Wednesday after prime minister’s questions, continuing on Thursday and possibly Friday. The final vote, pulled last month after the prime minister admitted she would lose by a “significant margin”, is due to follow in the middle of the week following.Time is narrowing for May’s deal to be approved before 29 March, because once MPs agree in principle, ratification legislation will have to be voted through by parliament, a process that normally takes months.Failure to agree would mean the UK would crash out without a deal, and it would be difficult for MPs to force the government into proposing an alternative. But ministers would need to pass dozens of items of emergency legislation. Labour has said it would seek to introduce amendments that would make no deal difficult to implement.Downing Street had hoped Brexit passions would have cooled over the Christmas break as warnings mount about the potential impact of no deal, but the early signs are that rebel positions remain firm and the vote is expected to be lost.It is believed there are 30-40 Tory MPs deemed certain to vote against May’s deal, including former cabinet ministers and veteran anti-EU campaigners, although that would be a significant reduction from the 100 who publicly declared their opposition in December.The DUP, whose 10 MPs help keep May in power, has been repeating its objections to the proposed Brexit arrangement over the past 24 hours, despite continuing talks with No 10 to try to resolve the impasse.Sammy Wilson, the DUP’s Brexit spokesman, said his party opposed the backstop because if it came into force, Northern Ireland “would have to treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country” and would not participate in any trade deals that the UK may enter into in the future.Downing Street has floated the idea of staging a second parliamentary vote almost immediately after the first in an attempt to pressure MPs to change their minds, in a crisis atmosphere of rising public concern and jittery financial markets.The argument is helped by May’s position being more secure than it was in December after rebel MPs failed to unseat her. Under Conservative party rules, she cannot be challenged again for nearly a year.Labour has repeatedly called for May to step aside if her deal is voted down, but she could only be forced out if she were defeated in a Commons vote of no confidence. Rebel Tories have said they would not vote with Labour in such a situation.EU sources said on Friday they did not know what May was aiming for with her round of holiday telephone diplomacy. “That is still not clear,” said one diplomat, adding that the “surgical removal” of the backstop demanded by some Eurosceptics was “not remotely possible”.A call by the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, for the EU to define the temporary nature of the backstop is not seen as realistic. “Define it how?” the diplomat said. “It can’t be a unilateral departure from the backstop and it can’t be time-limited. All of this tends to run around in circles.”Meanwhile, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, told a group of European newspapers that EU leaders could not hope to push May into organising a second referendum because it would inflame political tensions.“The extent to which Britain is ided currently is small compared with the tensions a second vote would cause. It would continue to split our nation,” Barclay said, in remarks first reported by Germany’s Die Welt.The minister said it would not be possible to hold a referendum before the EU parliamentary elections, due in May, and if Britons had to vote for MEPs again, he predicted there would be “huge democratic damage, because the citizens voted to quit”.Barclay even signalled that holding European elections in such a context could lead to a surge in support for Ukip or other anti-EU populists. “Even our European colleagues cannot be interested in it because that would trigger a very populist reaction,” Barclay said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c62108bf60db842e2baa1739094aa56bf1d0282d/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76bc0d5886870cc279acbc8c56a8941c","title":"john redwood uk brexit benefits ken clarke","story":"Ken Clarke responds to MP by saying Brexit idend was always a complete mythTheresa May will continue efforts to win over Tory critics of her Brexit deal as MPs return to Westminster, but both wings of the party have said the plan is unlikely to receive support.Sir John Redwood, the newly ennobled Tory Brexiter, once again said he would not support the deal, saying there were “huge agendas of opportunity” if the UK left the bloc.Despite speculation that his being granted a knighthood in the New Year honours was a means for May to secure his support, Redwood maintained on Saturday morning that the UK could enjoy an economic boost by adding the billions promised to the EU to a post-Brexit budget.Redwood, who has been the MP for Wokingham in Berkshire since 1987, was one of the Eurosceptic cabinet ministers labelled “bastards” by John Major as he fought to ratify the Maastricht treaty in 1993 and has continued to fly the anti-EU banner in the Commons ever since.“I think many of us in the country just want to move on and talk about something else,” he said in an interview on Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday morning. “We want to be out and we know it will work just fine.”Amid dire predictions by remain supporters over the potential damage a no-deal Brexit could inflict on the country’s economy, people were losing sight of the potential benefits, Redwood said.“I think getting out is a big economic boost. I want to have a debate about how we are going to spend all the money we are going to have by not paying the £39bn-plus of this agreement, and the continuing large contributions each year,” he said.He claimed that leaving the EU would allow the UK to look again at “rather penal” import tariffs set by Brussels, encourage more domestic food production, to rebuild the fishing industry, and to control its own laws and borders.“There are huge agendas of opportunity, which are being crowded out by endless remain propaganda from people who tell us falsehoods about what might happen if we just left.”Speaking later on the same programme, Ken Clarke, a veteran Tory remain supporter, agreed it was unlikely that May would succeed in gaining parliament’s backing for her deal. But politicians should not stop looking for ways to minimise the damage Brexit could cause to the country, he said.Despite claiming “the greatest respect” for Redwood, Clarke rubbished the assertion that the economy could enjoy a boost in the event of a no-deal Brexit, arguing that any attempt to renege on the country’s bills to Europe would deeply damage international relations.“If we were to repudiate all the financial obligations that we have had from the past then that will merely mean the tariffs and everything else will come in more quickly,” he said. “The Brexit idend was always a complete myth. It was known to be a myth by the people who painted it on the bus.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a0dfd8782714da7cc0432530004e2eae84cc715/0_124_5080_3048/master/5080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=292507e25b063627e2f6db5d6e97413e","title":"london ultra low emission zone","story":"London’s ultra-low emission zone launches in April. It will cut pollution, but some argue it could price motorists off the roads•ULEZ: what you need to know•Is the zone a good or a bad idea?This April will see the start of what the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, proclaims will be the toughest emissions standards for vehicles in any world city. Will it be a historic turning point in the battle against filthy air in our cities – or will it prompt “yellow vest” style protests from furious drivers?Many motorists are unaware of how strict – and expensive – the new rules are for the ultra-low emission zone (ULEZ), which starts on 8 April this year. Diesel cars manufactured before 2015 are likely to fall foul of the rules, as well as most pre-2006 petrol cars. They will be charged £12.50 to come into central London at any time, on top of the £11.50 congestion charge, which operates from Monday to Friday 7am to 6pm.Then from October 2021 the zone will be hugely expanded, with mums and dads on the school run potentially affected, as 3.6 million London residents are brought into the scheme. Any cars failing to meet the standards by then will have to pay £12.50 a day if they are driven anywhere in an area bounded by the city’s north and south circular roads.Precisely how many drivers will be hit with the charge are unknown, as many are likely to sell older vehicles before 2021. Transport for London says there are about 1.15m vehicles currently registered in the expanded ULEZ.But that still leaves at least 100,000 cars or more paying the charge – which critics are calling a new “poll tax” on Londoners that they claim will rake in as much as £750m to £1.5bn from hard-pressed motorists. But TfL says the expected impact will be much less – it projects that in 2019-20, the first year of the ULEZ, revenue will be £174m and costs £47m, producing a surplus of £127m.In 2021, when the greatly expanded zone comes into force, TfL is projecting annual revenue to jump to £222m, but costs will also rise as a new generation of enforcement cameras are installed. It estimates costs in 2021-22 will be £125m, so the surplus will fall to £97m.The battle to bring healthy air to city residents is not just in London. In 2020 Birmingham is planning to introduce pollution charges on cars driving within the city’s ring road, with a £6 to £10 fee mooted. In Leeds there are radical plans to charge the most polluting vehicles up to £50 a day to enter a new clean air zone from January 2020. Meanwhile, Bath has plans to charge many motorists £9 a day to drive into its Georgian streets, but the proposals have provoked anger and resentment.The idea behind London’s ULEZ is a determination to clean up the city’s filthy air – widely regarded as the dirtiest of any major city in Europe. At least 360 primary schools in the capital are in areas exceeding safe legal pollution levels, half of which comes from cars, lorries and buses.Thousands signed an open letter from the Healthy Air campaign, which said: “I strongly welcome the mayor’s commitment to tackling London’s illegal and harmful levels of air pollution. Road transport is a major source of air pollution and we need urgent action to tackle this.”Friends of the Earth went further, calling for a bigger ULEZ, and sooner. It said: “The ULEZ must come into force much sooner than planned – by the end of 2018 at the latest. Londoners shouldn’t have to wait until 2021 for cleaner air. The zone must cover the whole of London to make a difference, extending beyond the north and south circular roads and including all of outer London too.”But there are numerous opponents, such as the Alliance of British Drivers and motorbike groups – and even the Musician’s Union. The Motorcycle Action Group said: “Will the mayor compensate the thousands of low-paid workers using small, older motorbikes because it’s all they can afford, and what scheme will he be setting up to pay the difference in cost between cheap, older bikes and expensive public transport?”How will motorists in London react? Many will only be waking up to the charges just weeks before they come into force. journalist Graham Snowdon, who lives in Herne Hill, south London, and was driving a 2006 Ford Focus 1.8 diesel, says that he has been forced to buy a new car as a result of the ULEZ changes. “I drive into what’s currently the congestion charge zone once a week to play football. But it’s in the evening, and I don’t have to pay. The first I knew about ULEZ was an email I got from TfL. I knew it was expanding, but I didn’t know what it entailed. It was going to cost me £12.50 a week from this April – and then £12.50 every day from 2021, so I had to get rid of the car.“But I suppose that I’m not that annoyed NOx emissions are really dangerous, and it’s good in a way that I’ve been forced to do this. The Ford Focus could probably have done another 50,000 miles or so. Instead, I’ve paid £8,000 for a second-hand 2014 Ford Focus 1.0 Ecoboost, and the bonus is that my car tax will now only be £30 a year. I thought I better buy a new car now, ahead of April. When other people wake up to this, I think it’s going to have quite an impact on the second-hand car market.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0934ac70a7a97e6fb467b50f2dbe124076d35995/0_1825_4563_2738/master/4563.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d095084562486d9e26e04e8ec761a033","title":"truth obesity five fat myths debunked","story":"For years, I swallowed all the theories about fat, believing I could be obese and fit. Here are five dangerous myths, debunkedAs far back as I can remember, I was overweight. My parents were morbidly obese, just like three of my grandparents (my maternal grandmother was “only” obese – in other words, just fat). In my teenage years, I tried every diet going, and would sometimes lose weight, only to put it all on again. Eventually I concluded that so-called “normal” weight just wasn’t realistic for me. It would mean a life of permanent hunger.I also decided such a life wasn’t necessary: excess weight was demonised without reason. I might be fat, but I didn’t smoke, drink, consume fast food or red meat. And I was physically fit. I decided to set other priorities in my life I trained as a psychotherapist, got married and started renovating an old house.At the age of 30, I tipped the scales at 150kg (23st 8lb). If asked, I told people I was comfortable with my weight and that my only wish, if anything, was to be a bit fitter. But at that same time, I was secretly visiting an obesity clinic as an outpatient and thinking about a stomach-stapling operation. I eventually decided not to have the operation, and buried myself even deeper in studies that showed that being overweight was not really harmful.My doctor never mentioned my weight. Every time I went, my blood pressure was enormously high, but I dismissed it as “white coat hypertension”. I managed to ignore the fact that I was suffering frequent back pain and that I was having trouble sleeping, in part because of my heavy snoring.This went on until, one day, I slipped while doing housework and injured my knee. I know now that I tore my cruciate ligament but at the time my doctor said it was probably nothing to worry about and prescribed me ibuprofen. Then I had another accident while renovating our house. I walked with a limp for months, until it happened again.After more than a year of pain and restricted mobility, I had a breakdown. I realised that, over the previous few years, my health had decreased while my weight had increased. And I knew that if I kept going this way, within a few years I would be unable to walk – while still in my early 30s. Something had to change.I don’t consider myself stupid or naive. I have always been the kind of person who questions things I have a doctorate, and an interest in science. But still I believed in so much fat logic, probably because I was always surrounded by it. I was told from an early age that our family had “fat genes” and that my metabolism was “broken” – which appeared to be corroborated by my own experiences.Tearing down the fallacies I had believed for my whole life was a long and sometimes painful process. But in the following year, I began to put it to practical use. I restricted my calorie intake. I moved more. Within a year, I was in the normal weight range for my 175cm (5ft 9in) height and a few months later I weighed 63kg (9st 13lb) – the least I had weighed since the age of 12 or 13. Fat logic is not just a problem for fat people I have never met a person who was completely free of it. Here are a handful of the most persistent myths, debunked.There’s one thing we can all agree on: everybody needs energy. A widespread fallacy is that there is a huge range of difference in people’s metabolic rates. The amount of energy we need is influenced by various factors, but the main ones are body mass, and what that mass is made up of. A person’s energy consumption can actually be calculated relatively precisely using certain formulae. The only information you need is height, weight, sex and approximate daily activity levels. You can find plenty of online calculators just search “basal metabolic rate calculator” (this is the number of calories you would require if you were resting all day).There’s a high probability that your BMR will lie somewhere between 1,400 and 2,000 kcal a day – unless you happen to fall into one of the two extremes of very high or very low body mass. The bottom line is that most people use far more than 1,500 kcal a day, but even people with extremely low consumption still need significantly more energy than 1,000 kcal. Which means it’s practically impossible not to lose weight on a daily calorie intake of 1,000 kcal.So the question is, are you eating as little as you think you are?Despite the common cliche of the fast food-guzzling, fat person, my favourite meal used to be a large mixed salad with salmon. I ate it regularly, and in my mental calorie journal I would estimate it contained about 500 kcal. When, after many years, I finally weighed out all the ingredients and calculated the actual number of calories they contained, I discovered that the dressing alone, with three tablespoons of olive oil, contained about 300 kcal.The number of calories in the salad itself – tomato, cucumber, red pepper and lettuce – was within reason. Mozzarella, though, added considerably more to the total, and the fact that the salmon was fried meant the final tally for this meal was 1,500 kcal – three times the amount I had estimated, and equivalent to the entire daily energy requirements for a small, slim woman.The hard truth is that anyone who believes they “don’t actually eat that much” and then still inexplicably puts on weight doesn’t have a problem with their metabolism, but with their perception of their own eating habits.This is the fat logic argument I encounter most often, and which I believed myself for many years. It is also the one I kick myself about the most, in retrospect. I always claimed to have made a rational decision about my weight, but I was labouring under two misapprehensions: that it is extremely difficult to achieve and maintain normal weight and that it doesn’t have all that many advantages anyway. Now, I argue the opposite whenever I can.I respect anyone’s decision to set other priorities and happily accept being overweight or obese. Just because you can change a situation, it doesn’t mean you must. That said, it’s important for that decision to be an informed one.This is not about whether your bum looks better as a size 36 or a size 42. Rather, it’s about what goes on inside our bodies, and about how being overweight directly affects our quality of life. Obesity is a bit like smoking: the tumours don’t start growing right after the first cigarette. For someone who is naturally prone to lung problems, it might take five years. Another person’s lungs might be able to take 50 years of constant damage. But just because the damage isn’t visible, it doesn’t mean it isn’t there.Analysis from 2013 investigated the long-term consequences of obesity with the specific aim of examining so-called “healthily obese” people. A comparison between healthy people of normal weight and healthy but obese subjects showed the latter group had a significantly higher risk of dying or developing cardiovascular disease. The scientists who carried out the study therefore came to the conclusion that the belief you can be “fat but fit” is just a myth.A 2015 study confirmed those results. It followed supposedly healthily obese subjects over 20 years and found that more than half became unhealthily obese during that time. Their risk of becoming ill was eight times higher than that of the healthy group with normal weight. The risks include, but are not limited to: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, sleep apnoea, arthritisjoint problems, fertility problems, asthma, back pain, incontinence, gout and stroke.For a long time, I convinced myself that being overweight didn’t impact particularly negatively on my life. I’d suppress the panting as I climbed the stairs, so I could tell myself I had no problem walking up three floors. Once at the top, I would sometimes pretend to cough or laugh to hide the fact that I was out of breath.Our society makes it very easy for us to delude ourselves. People who exercise regularly are seen as “fitness freaks”, “sports fanatics” or similar, while “normal” people are the ones who lead physically inactive lives. Now that I can compare the abilities of my well-trained body (and I’m absolutely not athletic or super-fit) with my abilities before, I’ve come to realise how far below optimum my fitness level really was. I’m not saying there aren’t any overweight people who do a lot of exercise. But I can imagine lots of people fall prey to a similar kind of distorted thinking as I did: I used to consider even relatively normal things to be great sporting achievements. The same applies to the achievement a US leader of the fat-acceptance movement, Ragen Chastain, claims makes her an “elite athlete” – with a morbidly obese BMI. In 2013, she ran a marathon and published an article about it with the title My Big Fat Finished Marathon. She wrote about how, after five months of training, she covered just over 40km in 12 hours and 20 minutes.It is an achievement for a severely obese person to walk the entire length of a marathon in one go. But Chastain’s average speed of less than 3.5km (2.2 miles) an hour is much slower than normal walking speed. The marathon had officially ended hours before she crossed the finishing line – the stands removed, the organisers gone. The last participant to complete the race, several hours before Chastain, was a woman in her 70s. Of course, everyone has to start from their own fitness level. When I weighed 150kg and was more or less unable to move for six months, average sporting achievements were as likely for me as breaking Olympic records. In the first few months, I was proud of reaching various milestones, such as walking for half an hour without stopping, or spending 20 minutes on a bike for the first time in years.It’s good to be proud of your own development and inidual progress, even when it might not objectively seem that impressive. But declaring your own, below-average performance to be an objective record, and therefore to claim that any improvement is unnecessary, will only stop you – and others – from tackling the problem of excess weight.This statement is fat-logical only when referring to people who are not underweight or for whom losing weight would mean they would become underweight. Let me start with my own experience. When I weighed 150kg, there was no one who seriously claimed that losing weight would not be a good idea for me. But apart from my mother, as far as I can remember, in all those years nobody ever asked me about my weight. My weight was the elephant in the room, which no one mentioned – until I brought it up myself.I lost my first 40kg (6st) in secret, without anyone noticing. When I reached about 105kg (16st 7lb), everyone around me suddenly noticed I’d lost weight. At over 100kg, I was still very much within the obese range, but others saw it quite differently. From all sides, I was asked, surely I didn’t want to lose any more weight? I must be done with my diet now, right? Yeah, that’s terrific losing so much weight, but you don’t need to lose any more – surely?A neighbour who saw me gardening worriedly asked my husband how much I now weighed and asked him please to make sure I ate more. When I ran into a colleague on the street, she half-jokingly asked when I was going to be diagnosed with anorexia another admitted he deliberately hadn’t reacted too enthusiastically to my new size for fear I might go to “the other extreme”.It was ironic: when I was sick and almost bedridden at 150kg, no one ever expressed concern or commented on my weight in any way. And then, when I lost 40kg, was able to walk again and feeling better than I had for years, people started to get worried about my health. It was as if my body had suddenly become a public forum, after years of having been a taboo subject.Genes create a basic situation, but they don’t oblige anyone to be fat. Things that can genuinely be explained by genetics are appetite, preferences for certain flavours (such as sweet or fatty) and the natural urge to be physically active.Several studies have shown that carriers of so-called obesity genes consume on average 125-280 kcal a day more and have no differences in their metabolic rates. To say that some children have a genetic propensity towards obesity means only that they have an inherently larger appetite than naturally slim children, who feel hungry less often.But the deciding factor in whether children have a tendency towards being fat is the set of conditions created by their parents and the rest of their environment (such as school meals), which can serve either to encourage or discourage obesity. Living in a household where high-calorie food is constantly available won’t necessarily make children fat if their genetics mean they have a naturally small appetite. Children with naturally large appetites, by contrast, will pounce on the proffered fare. However, studies have shown that food preferences are not an inescapable fate. In one experiment, the brains of obese and normal weight subjects were scanned to record their reactions to food. The reward centres in the obese subjects’ brains showed a strong reaction to high-fat foods (fast food, sweets). The test was repeated after the subjects had followed a dietary plan containing healthy, low-calorie foods for several months. The reward centres in the obese subjects’ brains reacted more strongly to these foods in the second test.In the end, our genes just set out the path we will follow if we don’t actively strive to change its direction (which can take great effort). However, those efforts are only temporary: once we have become habituated to new behaviours, we no longer have to struggle to maintain them.So how is my life now that I’m maintaining my target weight? The actual weight loss hasn’t changed much, but the impact on my life has been great. The fact I now take pleasure in exercise has opened up an entire spectrum of new interests to me that would once have been out of the question. My husband and I went on a cycling holiday. I’ve discovered climbing as a new hobby – and pilates, too. My gym buddy and I now meet once a week for coffee and weight training. I’ve gained so much – and have come to see that being thin doesn’t have to mean a life of constant deprivation.• This is an edited extract from Conquering Fat Logic by Nadja Hermann, published by Scribe on 10 January at £14.99.

He confessed after a good win and a bad loss in his comeback in Brisbane this week that he had no idea how long he would stay in the game, but the angst in his voice suggested he will not go meekly. His hip still hinders his lateral movement, although his all-court speed is more convincing than during any of his 12 matches last year, when he beat two top-20 players in five wins.Certainly, he looked the part in beating James Duckworth in the opening round, but was disturbingly off the pace in two quick sets the following day when Daniil Medvedev put him out of a tournament he has won twice and in which he had been unbeaten.Katie Boulter and Heather Watson, who are warming up in Hobart, and Cam Norrie, who plays Benoît Paire in Auckland – where he grew up – complete the British sextet for the first grand slam of the season, which starts on 14 January . Still, for all their best ambitions, any of them would be pleased get past the first round. Which leaves Konta, 37 in the world and determined to put a nightmare 2018 behind her, as the standard bearer.Much has changed for Konta since she went out in straight sets to Agnieszka Radwanska in the first round here a year ago: her coach, her management and, more importantly, her strategy. She was candid over lunch in London a few weeks ago when she spoke about the reason for her dramatic slide in the rankings after a season when she had announced her arrival at the summit of her sport with three breakthrough titles and a run to the Wimbledon semi-finals. “I basically just ran out of steam,” she said.To fix that, she will play more selectively, she said, organising quality time to breath life back into her game and her enthusiasm for a sport she began in this city more than two decades ago. “I’m going to have cycles of tournaments, rest, train, tournaments, rest train,” she said.Konta’s mood will have improved after beating the Czech Miriam Kolodziejova 6-3, 6-2 in 71 minutes in Sydney yesterday.She acknowledged change was needed. So out went her American coach, Michael Joyce, after less than a full season, and in came the Frenchman Dimitri Zavialoff. She and Joyce had a frank discussion in Wuhan that both acknowledged, “We’d kind of come to the end of our road,” as Konta put it – and it was all done a week later in Beijing.Konta says of Zavialoff, her fifth coach in 10 years: “It is much more of a partnership than I have had in previous coaching relationships. He encourages me to have a lot more input. There has to be a certain amount of compatibility. The personalities start to evolve and then, when you spend more time together in stressful situations, it becomes more apparent how well the two work together. But that takes time.”Elsewhere, there is calm for one man seemingly immune to stress. Roger Federer’s 22nd successive win in Australia – since losing in the Hopman Cup two years ago – saw off Alexander Zverev and put Switzerland on the board against Germany in Perth on Saturday. Federer looked sharp, relaxed and happy.Wonderful for Federer . Not so great for opponents waiting for him to grow old more disgracefully. Novak Djokovic’s surprise loss to Roberto Bautista Agut in Doha the previous evening will have put a spring in the 37-year-old’s step and it is not beyond him to win his 21st slam in Melbourne, scene of his remarkable comeback after seven months out with a knee injury in 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a4dbf4bd161859bf52e278360b1997a502eeacd/43_153_1186_711/master/1186.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8964eb79e17d038fe9618f4e798e0fee","title":"kele okereke on masculinity and the music industry","story":"When Bloc Party released their debut album in 2005, Kele Okereke made people look at the music world differently. As a gay man of colour he didn’t fit the everyday indie rock frontman mould – he shattered it. As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we look at his extraordinary influence. Images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Laura McCluskeyNobody could accuse Kele Okereke of standing still. Following the release of his acclaimed 2017 solo effort, Fatherland, he’s spent the second half of this year on a sold-out international tour with his band Bloc Party, who are revisiting their beginnings by performing their seminal debut album, Silent Alarm, in its entirety. Meanwhile, he’s somehow found time to co-compose the score for the highly anticipated new musical Leave to Remain, which opens at the Lyric Hammersmith in January, with songwriter Matt Jones.And while his professional life continues to metamorphosise, his personal life has also taken on a new dimension as he, along with his partner, welcomed a baby girl into their lives. They called her Savannah. When I interviewed Okereke for Attitude magazine last year, I reminded him that he’d once proclaimed that his solo album came about because all his bandmates wanted to stop and have babies, but he wanted to wait until he was 35.“Did I say that? Wow!” he said. “I’ve always wanted to be a father, but as a gay man I didn’t know if it was possible.”While being a gay parent in the UK these days isn’t exactly a revolutionary act, back in the mid-noughties a queer black singer fronting an indie rock band was nothing short of extraordinary. This was a scene dominated by straight white men where a certain type of swaggering masculinity was the default, yet here was a softly spoken, soulful gay man whose band was leading the race.Even though Okereke himself didn’t formally come out until his solo career took off, during Bloc Party’s reign his queerness was hiding in plain sight. He was never a flamboyant performer in the Freddie Mercury mould, and he didn’t openly embrace his sexuality the way a new generation of queer singers including Olly Alexander, Troye Sivan and Hayley Kiyoko would come to do. But his tender masculinity and softly coded lyrics spoke volumes.As a young, gay, indie music fan myself, who was many years away from landing the job of deputy editor of Attitude, I can attest to the importance of seeing someone like Okereke up on stage back then. And even though he might have been deliberately singing ambiguously, when Okereke launched into I Still Remember, from sophomore album A Weekend In The City, the queer intent was clear. The song is about two teenage lovers, both too afraid to make a move (“You should have asked me for itI would have been brave”). Here was someone who saw the world differently, here was someone like me.Fast forward 11 years and there’s nothing coded about Okereke now, or the songs he sings. On Fatherland he duets with Years \u0026amp Years’s Olly Alexander, on a track called Grounds for Resentment. “It’s the first time I’ve ever sung a romantic duet with another boy, and that’s important,” he says. “I feel, as a gay singer, you can fall into the trap of thinking we’re not really allowed to express desire. That as a gay man singing about love and desire, everything has to be coded.”That trap has opened wide now and Okereke can proudly count himself among a legion of queer musicians whose sexuality is everyday, yet still extraordinary.Okereke’s boundless musical curiosity has since seen him move into theatre as he scores a highly anticipated new play, out early 2019. Leave to Remain tells the story of a gay couple whose marriage forces two very different families to come together.While it’s clear that Okereke’s not short of projects to give his attention to, his primary focus for the foreseeable future is his own family. When I asked him if he has any doubts about raising his daughter as a gay parent he’s firm in his response: “We’re going to do all that we can to make sure she has the strength to stand in her own convictions,” he says. “That’s how I’ve lived my life. I’ve had to go out and be myself in spite of what everyone was telling me.”Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps. We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2.

It would relieve pressure on US immigration authorities – and transfer it to Mexico.But Mexican officials who would in theory implement the policy say they have been kept in the dark over the change – and some have explicitly opposed it.“I had heard rumors, but I was not consulted,” said Tonatiuh Guillén, head of Mexico’s national immigration authority, told the .“The US can’t just dump people into Mexico – they have to knock. We’ve asked for more answers, but the US government is shut down, so I guess they’ll answer when they figure that out. It’s all up in the air,” he said.The number of people – mostly Central Americans – who would be parked in Mexico as a result of the move could be enormous.In 2018, 93,000 people were given credible fear interviews – the first step in the asylum process. While overall immigration levels are at historic lows, the number of families and children crossing is at an all-time high. And a backlog of nearly 1m cases in the US means asylum seekers could remain in Mexico for years.“It’s not some small detail. The numbers just aren’t manageable. It will have far-reaching effects on services, employment, everything – the social and political fabric of Tijuana and other border cities,” said GuillénConfusion over the current state of the plan reigns on both sides of the border: when Nielsen announced the move on 20 December, Mexico’s foreign ministry reluctantly accepted, although within days the foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said he would need more information from US authorities. Guillén said Mexico had not formally accepted the plan.Meanwhile, US Congress members wrote to the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, on 2 January requesting the text and details of any agreement.Hopes for clarity have been further complicated by the shutdown of the US federal government triggered by a funding row over Donald Trump’s demands for a $5bn wall on the southern border.US border officials are already limiting the number of people who can apply for asylum at a port of entry, creating delays of several months for migrants hoping to get into the US – and overwhelming public services in Mexican border cities.Activists in Mexico say the “catch and return” policy would push conditions past breaking point.“Aside from this taking away people’s right to apply for asylum, it would cause Mexico’s northern border cities to nearly collapse,” said Esmeralda Siu Márquez, the executive coordinator of Coalición Pro Defensa Del Migrante, a network of local migrant support organizations.“This would change Tijuana from being a transit point. Shelters, which are already at capacity, are temporary – we’d need housing, integration programs, school programs, etc. We don’t have the budget.”Officials in Tijuana have already stretched thin resources, normally focused on Mexican deportees, to deal with the more than 5,000 members of the Central American migrant caravans which started arriving in November.Mexico’s new president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, cut the country’s migration and refugee budget after he took office 1 December 2018, and has not indicated whether or not that would change in light of the new plan. His administration has also pledged visas and work in Mexico for Central American migrants.But for many, like Samuel Tabora, a 24-year-old construction worker, the kind of jobs available in Mexico – particularly low-skill factory positions in Tijuana – do not pay enough for them to send much back home to Honduras, where over two-thirds of the country lives in poverty.Faced with the prospect of staying years in Mexico, he said he would consider jumping the border fence with his partner and four-year-old daughter. “If they deport me, we’ll just turn around and come back. I want to work and make money and to have something to send home to my family,” he said.Since Nielsen’s announcement, US agents have twice fired teargas into Mexico to prevent some people, including families with young children, from attempting to breach the border fence.Several of the asylum seekers who had heard of the potential policy said they would simply wait it out in Mexico. “Going back, I may as well just tie a noose for myself and hang it from a tree,” said Francisco M, who left Guatemala with his wife and three children due to extortion threats from gangs. “We are here alone and it hurt to leave our roots, but I’d have to have a death wish to go back there. No, we will stay as long as it takes.”Meanwhile, human rights groups warn that Mexico, one of the most violent countries in the world, is not safe for asylum seeker. Last month two Honduran teenagers who had traveled with the caravan were murdered in Tijuana.Advocates warn the plan would add formidable new challenges to the already-tortuous asylum process. “The policy essentially dispossesses people of their right to trial. It takes me months to prepare one asylum case. I’ll maybe meet with a person six times. People cannot build cases in the US if they can’t meet with their lawyers. How will they get to their hearings?” said Erika Pinheiro of Al Otro Lado, a legal aid organization in Tijuana.It would also encourage migrants seeking asylum to take more treacherous routes, she said. “By taking away legal avenues to asylum, you’re basically telling people to jump over the fence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a0a5fc4970761209a05fdd1f23bd87e3a6c285b/0_127_5449_3271/master/5449.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=648881a0cd9174e87c5009452278c34c","title":"tropical storm pabuk batters thailand coast but tourists are spared the worst","story":"Nearly 30,000 people are forced into emergency shelters as the waning weather system skirts Koh Samui Floods and blackouts caused by Tropical Storm Pabuk have left nearly 30,000 people in evacuation shelters across southern Thailand, but tourists stranded on holiday islands were spared the worst and began to plot routes home.Pabuk, a once in three-decades weather system, packed winds of up to 75km (45 miles) an hour and brought heavy rains and storm surges as it lashed the entire south of the kingdom on Friday, downing power cables and causing widespread flooding.A fisherman died in southern Pattani province early on Friday as high waves smashed into his boat and another crew member was reported missing.But the storm tacked away from the key tourist islands of Koh Samui, Koh Phangan and Koh Tao where large numbers of holidaymakers hunkered down for 24 hours in heavy rains, unable to leave as airports closed and ferry services were cancelled.“There were no casualties, there is some sunshine today and I’m confident some tourists will be able to leave today as ferries and flights resume,” Kittipop Roddon, Koh Samui district chief said.But “red flag” warnings banning swimming off what are normally sun-baked paradise beaches at this time of year were still in place.“It’s all over. All 10,000 tourists are safe... I am relieved,” Krikkrai Songthanee, district chief of neighbouring Koh Phangan, an island famed for its full-moon parties, told AFP, adding only minor damage had been caused by high winds.But holidaymakers keen to leave the islands face long delays as transport links are slowly reopened on Saturday.The storm was downgraded early on Saturday to a depression with wind speeds slackening as it moved into the Andaman Sea, the country’s meteorological department said.Pabuk made landfall on Friday afternoon in Nakhon Si Thammarat province, south of the tourist hubs on the Gulf of Thailand, hammering the coastal province with rain.Authorities warned of flash floods as some parts remained inundated by a combination of rainfall and storm surges.Around 200,000 people were left without power as dozens of electricity poles were toppled by high winds or falling trees.Some 30,000 customers remained without power early Saturday, according to an update by the disaster prevention and mitigation department.A similar number of people remained in evacuation shelters, waiting for floods to recede and power to be restored, it added.Pabuk struck in peak tourist season, a blow to the cash-cow sector that is integral to Thailand’s economy.The kingdom is expected to welcome a record 40 million visitors this year."},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"Belfast 1994 archives: American embassy

january 14th vote","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t British prime minister Theresa May is seeking to gather support for her Withdrawal Agreement ahead of a crucial vote. Photograph: Reuters British prime minister Theresa May will continue efforts to win over Tory critics of her Brexit deal as MPs return to Westminster next week, but both wings of the party warned that the plan is unlikely to receive support.As the Commons returns from its Christmas break, the prime minister is expected to step up efforts to woo potential rebels while working with Brussels on further safeguards to address concerns about the Withdrawal Agreement.But a significant number of Tory Brexiteers remain opposed to the Withdrawal Agreement and appear relaxed about the prospect of a no-deal scenario with the UK leaving the European Union on March 29th with no transitional arrangements in place.Former Cabinet minister Sir John Redwood said a no-deal Brexit “will work just fine” despite the “idiotic” warnings about potential shortages of food and medicines.On the other side of the Tory ide, pro-EU veteran Ken Clarke said Mrs May’s deal - which he would be prepared to support - is “dying” and he would be “amazed” if the mood of MPs had changed over the Christmas break.Instead, he called for Brexit to be delayed until a way forward can be found.The prime minister delayed a vote on her Brexit deal last month, with MPs set to resume debate on it on Wednesday ahead of a vote the following week.She is said to be considering offering MPs further safeguards about the Irish backstop - the measure aimed at preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland which critics fear could leave the UK indefinitely bound into a customs union with the EU and prevent future trade deals with countries around the world.But former Brexit minister Steve Baker rejected the proposals, saying they were a “tedious and desperate attempt to rescue an unsalvageable deal”.The Daily Mail reported on Saturday that Mrs May is working on a “double lock” to put a time limit on the backstop.Officials are reportedly drawing up a possible Commons amendment to the Brexit vote which would give Parliament the right to serve notice to the EU of an intention to quit the backstop after 12 months if Brussels fails to agree a trade deal with the UK that would resolve the issue.Meanwhile, Mrs May is also seeking a written guarantee from the EU that a trade deal can be agreed within 12 months of the transition period ending.The Times reported that the prime minister will host Conservative Brexiteers for drinks on Monday and Wednesday as part of a charm offensive.On Friday, Mrs May had a “friendly” call with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker as she struggles to break the Brexit impasse and the pair are expected to keep in touch next week, fuelling speculation about efforts to win further concessions from Brussels ahead of the Commons vote, widely expected to be on January 15th.The conversation was part of Mrs May’s effort to obtain further written reassurances that the Irish Border backstop in her Brexit deal would never come into force. Downing Street refused to provide any further details of what was discussed.She is still hoping to obtain additional clarifications over the backstop before MPs vote on the deal in the week of January 14th, although it is not clear what Mrs May can get that would satisfy Tory rebels and the Democratic Unionist Party.But Brexiteer Sir John told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he could not support the deal, and added: “Many of us in the country just want to move on and talk about something else, we want to be out and we know it will work just fine.”As part of the no-deal planning, a major exercise will take place on Monday with up to 150 lorries testing out plans to use Manston airfield near Ramsgate as a mass “HGV holding facility” to alleviate congestion on the roads to the Channel ports.Meanwhile, a dredger has been seen working in Ramsgate harbour, the port which is proposed as an alternative freight route to Europe if a no-deal Brexit results in chaos at Dover and the Channel Tunnel.Former chancellor Mr Clarke said Brexit should be delayed to prevent a no-deal situation.He told Today it was “highly unlikely” Mrs May’s deal would get through Parliament and “we need more time” to agree on how to proceed.“Nobody can deal with us on the continent until the British have agreed amongst themselves on some sort of consensus.”He suggested revoking Article 50, the legal notice for withdrawing from the EU, until details of the future relationship sought with Brussels can be agreed - something which could take years.He warned a no-deal Brexit would be a “car crash” and dismissed the 2016 referendum result as “one opinion poll”.“If we are insisting that one opinion poll means we have to leave, we have got to minimise the damage,” he said. - AgenciesDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

It\u0027s difficult to impose strict limits on your children\u0027s screen use if you are constantly on screens yourself. It\u0027s much better to be authoritative about screens if you practise what you preach,” he said.“We suggest that age appropriate boundaries are established, negotiated by parent and child that everyone in the family understands. When these boundaries are not respected, actions need to be put in place with parents making consequences clear.”Four ways to keep your child safe onlineProf Russell Viner, the college’s president, said: “If you are authoritative - tough love and giving clear boundaries and warmth, that works.”The chief medical officer is currently considering setting new recommendations on screen time for children. But the college shied away from recommending a daily screen time limit for all children, saying more research was needed, particularly on the use of social media.So far, many studies on screen time have focussed on television habits, failing to keep up pace with the advent of websites and smart phones.Next week the head of the NHS is expected to unveil plans to expand children\u0027s mental health services to deal with the fallout from an explosion of social media.Simon Stevens has said the NHS has been left “picking up the pieces” of an epidemic of mental illness fuelled by digital overload.It comes after The  launched a duty of care campaign calling for more stringent regulation of sites like Facebook and Instagram, in order to protect children from harm.The expansion of mental health services for children - and the rollout of a four week target for treatment - are expected to form part of a 10-year plan for the NHS.BBC art expert reveals rare painting worth thousands of pounds was destroyed by his catComment: Everything and everyone must be sacrificed in Downing Street\u0026#39s selfish quest to keep Mrs May as PMBritish researchers leading North Korean \u0026#39rescue missions\u0026#39 from a small office in LondonFamily of father killed in front of son pay tribute to \u0026#39devoted, honourable man\u0026#39 as police arrest two over fatal train stabbingDid you buy a laptop in the Christmas sales?

If it did not support a democratic country that was under threat, we might have to ask which country might be next? she added.Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy of 23 million and a key US ally in the Indo-Pacific region, is claimed by China and considered to be Beijing’s most sensitive issue. It also borders the disputed waters of the South China Sea, another major flashpoint for potential future conflict between US and Chinese forces.   The sea carries an estimated one third of global shipping - including oil and gas to Japan and South Korea - and it faces maritime disputes between Brunei, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam.Beijing, which claims the sea in its entirety, has alarmed the international community with a build-up of military fortifications in its waters. The UK is making post-Brexit plans to beef up its presence in the tinderbox region, with Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, revealing to The Sunday  last week that Britain would open up a new military base in South East Asia.  A source close to Mr Williamson added that the base could be sited in Singapore or Brunei in the South China Sea. Asked by the Sunday  if she would support a British presence there, President Tsai signalled that Taiwan would welcome “any actions that will be helpful towards maintaining peace in the South China Sea, as well as maintaining freedom of passage.”She added: “If it is helpful towards these end goals then we adopt an open attitude towards that and we hope that all countries can work together fully in the South China Sea on all these issues and respect one another’s positions.” Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, plans to open up a UK military base in Southeast AsiaThe defence secretary has forged a hard line against Beijing’s actions in the South China Sea over the past year, deploying British warships – HMS Sutherland, HMS Albion and HMS Argyll – to the Asia-Pacific  to send the “strongest of signals” to China on the importance of freedom of navigation.  Taiwan, which operates with its own government, currency, military and foreign policy is not formally recognised by most nations, including the UK, but it is often considered by the West to be a democratic ally in a volatile region. President Tsai on Saturday issued a strong rebuttal to President Xi’s efforts to win over the Taiwanese public in his speech earlier this week by offering them a “one country, two systems” political arrangement. “As the democratically elected president of this country, I have no more important duty to than to defend our democracy, freedom and way of life,” she said, urging Beijing to have a “correct understanding” of Taiwanese thinking. “The people of Taiwan cannot accept the ‘one country two systems’. The lack of democracy in China is what most concerns Taiwan,” she said. “Secondly, China has a very poor human rights record and it does worry people if there is not a good human rights protection mechanism in place.Thirdly, China has never renounced using force to unify Taiwan, so because of these three factors we do have a lot of work to do to be able to build up trust between the two sides.Please review our commenting policyBBC art expert reveals rare painting worth thousands of pounds was destroyed by his catComment: Everything and everyone must be sacrificed in Downing Street\u0026#39s selfish quest to keep Mrs May as PMBritish researchers leading North Korean \u0026#39rescue missions\u0026#39 from a small office in LondonFamily of father killed in front of son pay tribute to \u0026#39devoted, honourable man\u0026#39 as police arrest two over fatal train stabbingDid you buy a laptop in the Christmas sales?

Together, the trio produced such viral R\u0026ampB spoofs as “I’m On a Boat”, “I Just Had Sex” and “Dick in a Box”, the latter winning an Emmy in 2007, its title engraved on the statuette’s base, according to custom.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialKieron Passaway of Vice recently argued the group’s 2008 follow-up, “Jizz in My Pants”, simultaneously a parody of hyper-sexualised music videos and male anxiety,\u0026nbspmarked a turning point in internet\u0026nbsphistory, bringing YouTube to prominence as a venue for professionally-produced original content and a “new frontier for toilet humour”.While the playful vulgarity The Lonely Island often trade in is nothing new, owing a debt to the “gross-out” comedies of the Nineties perfected by the Farrelly\u0026nbspBrothers and the American Pie series, the group bring it off in surprisingly sweet-natured, inclusive style and their affection for and knowledge of the genre they\u0027re satirising\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspobvious.Everything you need to know about the Golden Globes 2019The production values of their videos are extraordinarily high, an asset Samberg attributes to Schaffer’s technological prowess, as is the calibre of guest stars appearing in cameos. Justin Timberlake is a frequent collaborator while the likes of T-Pain, Akon and\u0026nbspKendrick Lamar have all appeared to generously send-up lazy hip-hop tropes.Michael Bolton’s appearance as himself on “Jack Sparrow”, allowing his preoccupation with the Pirates of the Caribbean films to derail their track together, is one of their most inspired moments, while\u0026nbsp“Motherlover”, in which Samberg and Timberlake propose a novel solution to the problem of finding Mother’s Day gifts, features two very game supporting turns from veteran actresses Patricia Clarkson and Susan Sarandon.The popularity of those videos, produced as SNL Digital Shorts, gave rise to three albums – Incredibad (2009), Turtleneck \u0026amp Chain (2011) and The Wack Album (2013) – as well as\u0026nbspPopstar, effectively a Lonely Island movie, in which Samberg\u0026nbspstarred as the deluded and self-sabotaging Bieber-esque\u0026nbspConner4Real.Samberg, Andre Braugher and Melissa Fumero in Brooklyn Nine-NineBrooklyn Nine-Nine has been Samberg’s\u0026nbspbiggest project since 2013. The show was cancelled by Fox after five seasons last May before being picked up by NBC just one\u0026nbspday later following a public outcry. Its sixth series premieres on 10 January 2019.\u0026nbspSamberg\u0026nbspappears as Die Hard-obsessed detective Jake Peralta\u0026nbspalongside former elementary school classmate Chelsea Peretti\u0026nbspand a talented supporting cast\u0026nbspincluding Andre Braugher, Stephanie Beatriz, Melissa Fumero and Terry Crews. The result is a gently progressive and warm comedy loaded with slapstick and ludicrous escapades.As that show commenced, the\u0026nbspcomedian married his long-term girlfriend Joanna Newsom, the renowned\u0026nbspsinger-songwriter and harpist. This unlikely couple\u0026nbspwere introduced after one of her concerts in 2008 by Samberg’s\u0026nbspSNL colleague\u0026nbspFred Armisen.Samberg described himself as a “superfan” of her work in conversation with Marc Maron in 2013 and said he regularly attended her shows before they met.The couple have a baby daughter and live in California.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He told Bloody Disgusting: “There was a time when one of the producers was like, ‘No, you have to see something at some point’ and forced me to write essentially a nightmare sequence where Malorie experiences one in that house.”Created with Sketch.The 25 best TV shows on Netflix UK Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about.

One thing many cryptocurrency analysts\u0026nbspagree upon is that price volatility will steadily decrease, thanks to a combination of its finite supply and regulation designed to help the market\u0026nbspstabilise and mature.Bitcoin price predictions for 2019: From $0 to $36,000, experts weigh Whilst some critics still argue, for varying reasons, as to the longevity of\u0026nbspbitcoin, the next 10 years should at the very least provide many more talking points and events to document its life,\u0026nbspDavid Thomas, director of Mayfair-based cryptocurrency broker\u0026nbspGlobalBlock, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.If, as expected, increased regulation enters the market then bitcoin will be opened up to a broader investor base, and with increased adoption, we expect to see volatility reduce and stability increase both of which will establish bitcoin and cryptocurrencies further as an asset class in their own right.10th birthday has prompted speculation about the cryptocurrency\u0027s future (Rock Star Pastries Composite)Bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology is also expected to continue to drive an entire industry of new applications.\u0026nbspVladislav Dramaliev, head of digital marketing at aeternity, believes this is where bitcoin\u0027s real promise lies.Mr\u0026nbspDramaliev\u0026nbspdescribes bitcoin\u0027s inception as starting a curious revolution, but believes the word evolution will be more appropriate to describe the next decade of bitcoin and blockchain\u0027s growth.One of the most incredible developments is that, 10 years after that first block was mined, there is actually a whole\u0026nbspindustry\u0026nbspbased around this fantastic technology. Today we have a mind-bogglingly erse range of iniduals and companies in the sphere, covering every possible spectrum of opinion, vision for the future, and agenda, he said.The public blockchain infrastructure is getting better and better, more developers are getting interested in blockchain applications, more entrepreneurs are looking for the next killer app, and more users are playing with digital assets on a blockchain. I don’t expect this process to slow down.

If a Brexit deal is agreed soon, growth will surely rise this year.The services PMI covers sectors such as hotels, restaurants, transport and finance, although not retail.Separately, the Bank of England reported on Friday that unsecured lending to British households slowed to an annual rate of 7.1 per cent in November, the slowest rate\u0026nbspsince March 2015.The number of new mortgage approvals for house purchases also fell to 63,728 in the month, well below the expectations of City of London analysts.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10.

Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features.

It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips.

If a Brexit deal is agreed soon, growth will surely rise this year.The services PMI covers sectors such as hotels, restaurants, transport and finance, although not retail.Separately, the Bank of England reported on Friday that unsecured lending to British households slowed to an annual rate of 7.1 per cent in November, the slowest rate\u0026nbspsince March 2015.The number of new mortgage approvals for house purchases also fell to 63,728 in the month, well below the expectations of City of London analysts.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

When adjusted for inflation, credit card debt is fractionally below a peak reached in Early\u0026nbsp2010 as the country emerged from one of the deepest recessions in its history.People with low incomes or living in poverty were turning to credit cards because of their heavy marketing and easy availability, according to David Steele of The Money Charity.Credit card lending continues to rise as interest rate hike loomsWhen personal loans are added in, each UK household has almost £8,000 of outstanding consumer credit.The Money Advice Service (MAS) estimates that 8.3 million people in the UK are over-indebted, and that 22 per cent of UK adults have less than £100 in savings, making them highly vulnerable to a financial shock such as losing their job or incurring unexpected bills.The precarious position of so many household could pose a wider threat, according to the BoE which warned more than a year ago that banks were in danger of underestimating the risks they face from being too lax in lending to consumers.\u0026nbspIf the economy were to enter a new downturn, lenders could incur £30bn of losses on their lending on credit cards, personal loans and for car finance, the BoE said in July 2017.But consumer credit, which includes credit cards, store cards, car finance and other loans grew 7.1 per cent in the year to the end of November to £215.4bn.Despite ongoing fears about the future of the economy as the UK prepares to leave the EU Britons have increased their total amount of credit card debt in every month since July 2013 as wages have lagged behind the rising cost of living.Earnings growth picked up to the highest level for a decade in the final quarter of 2018 but this has done little to make up for 10\u0026nbspyears of wage stagnation that has left average inflation-adjusted earnings still languishing below their pre-crisis levels.Sue Anderson of StepChange, which provides free advice for those facing debt problems, said credit cards are the single most common issue the charity encounters.\u0026nbsp“More than two thirds of people we helped in the first six months of last year had credit card debt, with an average of around £7,600 on their outstanding borrowing on cards,” Ms Anderson said.\u0026nbspConsumer credit growth slows in DecemberConsumer credit growth hits new 11-year highMore than a third of single mothers in debt, research findsOil-hungry companies are contributing to huge debt problems in Africa“Credit cards can be useful and convenient, and when used as originally intended for short-term purposes, can be a helpful way of timing payments.\u0026nbsp“But if borrowing builds up without being paid back on a monthly basis, it can become expensive and increasingly difficult to pay off – which is why the regulator is now requiring firms to take steps to help their customers address persistent credit card debt. If you are struggling to manage, seek free advice from a reputable debt charity.”The figures highlight a ide in the UK between those able to borrow at close to record-low rates against the value of their homes and others pressured into taking out high-cost credit in order to make ends meet.While interest rates have remained close to historic lows as the economy continues to grow slowly, the average APR on credit card lending bearing interest was 18.5 per cent in October 2018, higher than the 15 per cent seen in 2006 before the financial crisis.What to do if you want to reduce your credit card debt“Don’t panic,” says David Steele of The Money Charity. “Don’t get pressured into doing something before you have had time to take advice.

When adjusted for inflation, credit card debt is fractionally below a peak reached in Early\u0026nbsp2010 as the country emerged from one of the deepest recessions in its history.People with low incomes or living in poverty were turning to credit cards because of their heavy marketing and easy availability, according to David Steele of The Money Charity.Credit card lending continues to rise as interest rate hike loomsWhen personal loans are added in, each UK household has almost £8,000 of outstanding consumer credit.The Money Advice Service (MAS) estimates that 8.3 million people in the UK are over-indebted, and that 22 per cent of UK adults have less than £100 in savings, making them highly vulnerable to a financial shock such as losing their job or incurring unexpected bills.The precarious position of so many household could pose a wider threat, according to the BoE which warned more than a year ago that banks were in danger of underestimating the risks they face from being too lax in lending to consumers.\u0026nbspIf the economy were to enter a new downturn, lenders could incur £30bn of losses on their lending on credit cards, personal loans and for car finance, the BoE said in July 2017.But consumer credit, which includes credit cards, store cards, car finance and other loans grew 7.1 per cent in the year to the end of November to £215.4bn.Despite ongoing fears about the future of the economy as the UK prepares to leave the EU Britons have increased their total amount of credit card debt in every month since July 2013 as wages have lagged behind the rising cost of living.Earnings growth picked up to the highest level for a decade in the final quarter of 2018 but this has done little to make up for 10\u0026nbspyears of wage stagnation that has left average inflation-adjusted earnings still languishing below their pre-crisis levels.Sue Anderson of StepChange, which provides free advice for those facing debt problems, said credit cards are the single most common issue the charity encounters.\u0026nbsp“More than two thirds of people we helped in the first six months of last year had credit card debt, with an average of around £7,600 on their outstanding borrowing on cards,” Ms Anderson said.\u0026nbspConsumer credit growth slows in DecemberConsumer credit growth hits new 11-year highMore than a third of single mothers in debt, research findsOil-hungry companies are contributing to huge debt problems in Africa“Credit cards can be useful and convenient, and when used as originally intended for short-term purposes, can be a helpful way of timing payments.\u0026nbsp“But if borrowing builds up without being paid back on a monthly basis, it can become expensive and increasingly difficult to pay off – which is why the regulator is now requiring firms to take steps to help their customers address persistent credit card debt. If you are struggling to manage, seek free advice from a reputable debt charity.”The figures highlight a ide in the UK between those able to borrow at close to record-low rates against the value of their homes and others pressured into taking out high-cost credit in order to make ends meet.While interest rates have remained close to historic lows as the economy continues to grow slowly, the average APR on credit card lending bearing interest was 18.5 per cent in October 2018, higher than the 15 per cent seen in 2006 before the financial crisis.What to do if you want to reduce your credit card debt“Don’t panic,” says David Steele of The Money Charity. “Don’t get pressured into doing something before you have had time to take advice.

Without the constraints of physical controls, these virtual tools can take on the fluidity and precision of our natural human hand motion.Project\u0026nbspSoli\u0026nbspFounder Ivan\u0026nbspPouyrev\u0026nbspexplained his motivation behind the endeavour in a video posted in 2015.Capturing the possibilities of human hands was one of my passions, he said. How could we take this incredible capability, the finesse of human actions, and apply it to the virtual world?He explained that\u0026nbspthe technology can fit onto a single chip measuring\u0026nbsp8mm\u0026nbspby\u0026nbsp10mm, allowing it to fit in a large variety of devices.What is most exciting about it is that you can shrink the entire radar and put it in a tiny chip, he said.\u0026nbspThat\u0027s what makes this approach so promising. It\u0027s extremely reliable, there\u0027s nothing to break.

Ben Chu investigatesClick to followThe IndependentShadow chancellor John McDonnell (right) has suggested Labour could include a pledge to reduce the working week in its next manifestoAs a society we can’t seem to make up our minds about work. Do we want more of it? Or less?There’s a chilling fog of fear over what technological advances will mean for our jobs, with an endless supply of alarming forecasts about how robots and algorithms are set to displace human workers.But there’s also a furnace of angst about low productivity and under-investment by firms in just the kind of innovations that induce those nightmares of a “jobs apocalypse”.Boss wants to make four-day working week trial permanentSome lament the supposed proliferation of pointless, soul-dismantling, “bullshit jobs”. Yet no one gets out the bunting when a struggling company announces redundancies.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe UK’s official labour market surveys suggest\u0026nbspmany of us want fewer hours at work, presumably driven by a desire for a healthier “work-life balance”.Yet those same surveys also show that many people also want more hours, that the post-financial crisis curse of “underemployment” has not yet been lifted.Some complain about the raising of the state retirement age and the depressing prospect of being forced to work longer than they planned. But for others the big problem is ageism, the risk of being pressured out of jobs they enjoy prematurely.When it comes to work, we’re rather like those two diners in the Catskill mountains: “Boy, the food at this place is really terrible... Yeah, I know and such small portions.”Yet onto this terrain of confusion and apparent contradiction some stride confidently.To Alex Williams, a Corbynite academic, automation should be embraced by the left as the emancipation of labour, provided the gains are comprehensively redistributed.The Trades Union Congress seems to have been influenced by this cocktail of technological optimism and socialist assertion. Its general secretary\u0026nbspFrances O’Grady\u0026nbsprecently demanded a four-day week by the end of the century, declaring: “Bosses and shareholders must not be allowed to hoover up all the gains from new tech for themselves.”The Labour Party is keen too. The shadow chancellor John McDonnell has made favourable noises about the four-day week and is reported to be asking the crossbench peer, Robert Skidelsky, to head an inquiry into the subject.Yet this isn’t just a British story. There are tectonic rumblings from abroad too. The IG Metall union in Germany earlier this year won the right to a four-day week for its almost 900,000 members. One technology start-up, founded by former Google employees, has a “Free Friday” policy. Even a think tank close to the authorities in China has called for the most populous nation on the planet to have a four-day working week as soon as 2030.Any project that can unite German metal bashers, Silicon Valley coders and Chinese Communist apparatchiks clearly has an unusually wide appeal.So is the four-day week a big idea whose time has come? Or is it an unworkable left-wing fantasy? And even if a four-day week is economically feasible, should we really desire it? Or is it a case of being careful what you wish for?When Marei Wollersberger and her colleagues established an east London-based data design agency, Normally, as a four-day week operation in 2014, the motivation was largely personal.“We wanted to lead happier lives basically – enjoy ourselves more, not just to defer our enjoyment to retirement age,” she told me.But there was another goal: “There was also a motivation to be more productive.”The economics of the four-day week revolve around the concept of productivity, the amount we produce per hour worked.The size of the economy – the size of our national income – is derived from the value of all the goods and services produced by businesses and households.On the face of it, if we all worked one less day a week, our personal output would drop by around fifth. Multiply that fall across the overall economy and you’ve got an economy that is considerably smaller, implying lower income and lower living standards for all, one way or another.Yet what if working fewer hours were to stimulate our productivity? What if we produced more per hour working four days than we did per hour working five?In that case there might be no overall drop in total output, and therefore no decrease in living standards. If our productivity rose enough we might even have a higher income than we did before.Wollersberger says the model has worked in stimulating performance at her company. “You’re more productive – you achieve exactly the same or more in four days as you would in five,” she says. “And I honestly believe it’s better work.”\u0026nbspA New Zealand financial firm called Perpetual  found similarly gratifying results when it trialled a four-day week recently.“There was broadly no change in company outputs pre and during the trial,” said its boss. “No reduction in job performance and the survey data showed a marginal increase across most teams.”Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Bear in mind that no change in output despite a fifth less time at work implies a stunning increase in productivity.But beware cherry-picking. The results of a Swedish trial involving 70 nurses working a six-hour day were more mixed. While there was some boost to worker productivity, the city of Gothenburg also had to hire more nurses to cover the hours lost.Intuitively, this seems much more likely to be the result of moving to a four-day week in services sectors that are, currently at least, heavily reliant on face-to-face human interactions such as healthcare or teaching.That’s not to imply the shift in working patterns should be ruled out as impractical. There are benefits in terms of lower stress and happiness to set against those financial costs. But it’s probably unrealistic to expect the move to always pay for itself, at least in the short-term.And some experiments have flopped. Treehouse, an online educational firm in Oregon, was one of those companies which got media publicity for its four-day week in 2015. But Treehouse’s founder recently lamented that the working practice killed the work ethic in his company and called the experiment a “terrible thing”.The only way is down?Inidual “micro” trials are certainly useful, but they aren’t necessarily a reliable guide to “macro” economic impacts.The closest thing that we have to a state-mandated four-day week is France’s 35-hour week, introduced in 2000 under the Jacques Chirac-Lionel Jospin cohabitation.Jospin\u0026nbsp(left) and president Jaques Chirac (right) (AFPGetty)The first thing to bear in mind is that this does not mean all French people work a four-day week. The regulation simply means overtime kicks in after a worker has completed 35 hours and they accrue the right to holiday lieu days. Yet it does establish a social norm of fewer hours and a financial incentive for firms to limit them.Opinions are mixed about its results. France has a high unemployment rate relative to the UK and other developed countries and it’s notable that Emmanuel Macron campaigned for president promising to increase the flexibility of the system.And though the level of French productivity stands comparison with the most productive nations in the world, there’s no evidence that its growth rate has risen since it introduced the 35-hour week.This might incline us to scepticism about the value of the the state having any role in limiting working hours.\u0026nbspYet that could be the wrong conclusion. For the historic trend is clear. In the late 1900s, UK workers put in more than 2,500 hours a year on average. That’s down to 1,680 hours in 2017. There’s been a similar steep fall in other developed countries over the past century and a half.That reflects the fact that the five-day working week, as opposed to six days with only Sunday off, only become standard practice in the 20th century.It was the industrialist Henry Ford who was the pioneer in the US, giving his factory workers a five-day shift in 1926 while keeping their wages steady. This prefigured legislation and Congress’ 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, which mandated a maximum 40-hour working week (effectively five working days).We primarily think of John Maynard Keynes as the great promoter of employment for his pioneering theories on the economic benefits of government-funded job creation during the Great Depression.\u0026nbspBut it was this secular decline in hours worked, despite the agonising surge in unemployment in the 1930s, that led Keynes to look forward to a 15-hour working week in The Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren by the year 2000.The question is whether the recent flattening out is the end of the decline in hours worked,\u0026nbspor merely a pause.\u0026nbspAnd is a government nudge necessary to get history moving again?There’s also the question of consumption. One of the reasons Henry Ford instituted a five-day working week was revealed in a 1926 interview: “Leisure is an indispensable ingredient in a growing consumer market because working people need to have enough free time to find uses for consumer products, including automobiles.”In other words, it was less a paternalistic concern for his workers’ well-being\u0026nbspthan a recognition that it would create help create more customers for Ford.There’s an echo of this macroeconomic concern today, with government-linked Beijing researchers suggesting a four-day week could boost the domestic tourism and entertainment sectors and help rebalance the overall Chinese economy to consumption and away from excessive investment.But perhaps the major economic question about moving towards a four-day week is whether it\u0026nbspcould somehow boost our long-term productivity growth rate (perhaps by inducing more investment in automation by firms) or whether a shorter working week could only ever be the fruits of productivity growth with an origin elsewhere.The truth is that we don’t know the answer. Yet it’s vital to recognise that countries and societies have autonomy too, even now.\u0026nbspThe US has a considerably larger GDP per capita than any developed country in Europe. But the bulk of this gap is due not to a vastly higher level of productivity but the fact that Americans, on average, work many more hours than the French, Germans or Swiss or British and so on.The trade-off between work and leisure is different between our two continents. Both Europeans and Americans, by global and historical comparisons, have very comfortable standards of living. Choosing more leisure over extra working hours is not, whatever some might employers might argue, necessarily a route to penury and decline.Doing nothing for ever and everThe Victorian historian and essayist Thomas Carlyle believed in the redemptive power of work.“A man perfects himself by working,” he enthused. “Foul jungles are cleared away, fair seed-fields rise instead, and stately cities ... Even in the meanest sorts of labour, the whole soul of a man is composed into a kind of real harmony the instant he sets himself to work.”The (possibly apocryphal) epitaph on a Hertfordshire gravestone took a different view of the intrinsic value of hard labour.“Here lies a poor woman who always was tired​”One does not need to be a Carlyle-style work zealot to appreciate that there is some intrinsic psychological value to labour. Work is where many of us find not just an income, but friends, stimulation and status. But we can also see where that Hertfordshire washerwoman was coming from.This dichotomy underlines that not all jobs are the same, or are experienced the same by the worker. For every occupation that that does help to clear away someone’s jungles of mental disorder there will be one that is felt as detestable drudgery.One of the deficiencies of the debate over the four-day week, as with discussions of the appropriate retirement age, is a failure to acknowledge the vast ersity of both jobs and workers. Labour is not homogeneous.Working until 70 might seem entirely reasonable, even desirable, to the university professor, the politician or the TV presenter. But to the cleaner, the firefighter or shop assistant – especially jobs with a physically arduous component – it may have considerably less appeal.\u0026nbspAnd so views erge too on the desirability of the four-day week.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Frances Connolly, 52,  and Patrick Connolly, 54, from Moira, County Armagh in Northern Ireland, who scooped a £115 million EuroMillions jackpot in the New Year\u0027s Day lottery draw, during a photocall at the Culloden Estate and Spa in Holywood, Belfast, as they announce their winThe offshore patrol vessel HMS Mersey leaves Portsmouth Harbour as it is deployed to patrol the English channel following an increase in migrants crossing in small boatsRail protestors wearing masks with the faces of Prime Minister Theresa May and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling outside Kings Cross St Pancras station in London ahead of a visit by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to highlight \u0027rising rail fares and falling standards of service on Britain\u0027s railways\u0027 as part of Labour\u0027s Rail Action DayPolice restraining a man after he stabbed three people at Victoria Station in Manchester last night.

He confirmed he will remain in post and thinks it is important to continue working with Cabinet colleagues to ensure the best Brexit outcome for the countryOne of the most significant developments in the UK and broader Western economy over the past decade is the rise of the gig economy and self-employment. Around a sixth of the British workforce is now self-employed.This was brought home to me recently when I met the Romanian father of one of the friends of my young son. The father had been a chauffeur for a wealthy family in Chelsea. But he’d resigned after his son had started school and had signed on with Uber so he could pick his lad up directly from school and shift his driving work to airport shuttle-runs at night instead. “I wanted the flexibility and my previous employer couldn’t provide that,” he told me, as we watched our boys career around the playground.His work-life balance was not to be found in limiting the hours he worked (indeed he wanted to keep those the same or even increase them) but in the flexibility of his arrangements.Survey evidence suggests this is a common story. The majority of Uber drivers like the personal control over their working hours made possible by the platform. Drivers who valued flexible working reported higher levels of life satisfaction, as well as lower levels of anxiety.However, there was also a minority of Uber drivers who would prefer to work fixed hours in a more conventional work setting. And these workers reported lower levels of life satisfaction and higher levels of anxiety.A question of representationThis brings us back to the apparent paradox of many people in the UK workforce wanting fewer hours but many others wanting more.\u0026nbspDavid Bell, a labour market economist from the University of Stirling\u0026nbspwhose work, along with Danny Blanchflower of Dartmouth College in the US, has highlighted this ergence, says that the groups who want fewer hours tend to be older, while those who are underemployed seem to be younger.One of the implications is that younger people in the workforce may need the money from more hours because they are under greater financial pressure, perhaps because they have families, or perhaps because they have suffered a greater real wage squeeze since the financial crisis.\u0026nbspThis suggests that Corbynite left is correct in stressing that to consider the economic and social case for a four-day in isolation is a mistake. Incomes plainly matter too, as well as the level of inequality.\u0026nbspOne has to consider the role of income redistribution and employment policies. Give people higher incomes and more “outside options” for employment, perhaps through a jobs guarantee or even a universal basic income, and the desire for extra hours in their current job may well melt away. They may begin to make different work-leisure trade-offs than they do now.Perhaps one of the reasons why we some people languish in ultra-flexible gig economy jobs they don’t appreciate – like those disgruntled Uber drivers – is that, despite what most economic analysts say, there is actually hidden slack in our economy – and that if the slack was eradicated they could find the kind of regular job they wanted elsewhere.But that still leaves a circle to be squared, presuming that different people, all else equal, are still likely to put different weights on work and leisure. How do we give those who would prefer a four-day week more freedom to choose it, while protecting the interests of those who don’t?The empowerment of ordinary workers is Professor Bell’s answer. Let inidual employees have substantive input into determining the trade-off, rather than leaving it up to politicians or employers.This is how I know the NHS won’t survive without EU staffOver a million young women say they’re paid less than male colleaguesDJ jailed for raping boy, 3, in toilet at working men’s clubTrailblazing images of early 20th-century working conditions“One of the things that might help is a strengthening of worker representation, which has declined so dramatically,” he says. “Rather than jumping in to impose a four-day week you want to think first about whether workers’ interests are being properly represented.”This would be going with the historical grain, given the driving role of new trade unions in the achievement of an eight-hour working day in the 19th century and early 20th century.It’s notable not only that IG Metall workers in Germany this year were able to achieve a four-day working week through negotiation with bosses – but that they also had sufficient bargaining power to protect their overall levels of weekly pay.A fundamental question that underpins this broad discussion about the future of working hours is a philosophical one: what makes us happy and fulfilled as human beings?Modern psychological studies do partially back up Carlyle’s Victorian pompous sermonising: formal work can be as positive for human happiness as leisure, sometimes more so.\u0026nbspA job does seem to bring a valuable sense of social usefulness. Involuntary unemployment is clearly harmful for people’s mental health.But how much work do we want or need? Keynes in the 1930s called this desire for work “old Adam” and predicted that three hours a day in the future would be “quite enough to satisfy” this inherited instinct.Perhaps the right thing to do is not to dictate to people, or engage in speculation on what the future of work will look like, but rather to help them decide for themselves.Four day working weekOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But sceptics say “trail-hunting” is a cover.The South Shropshire Hunt had been licensed for trail-hunting events on trust land on one day next week and on 29 January.Pressure group National Dis-Trust says the South Shropshire took terriermen onto trust land at the Long Mynd estate last month and hunted for four hours, including hunting outside their licensed area.If I decided to run an event that met outside a village pub I would need permission from the councilThe National Trust allows “trail-hunting” but has banned the use of terriermen – men who use terriers to dig out foxes that have fled underground.“Multiple foxes were pursued and the terrierman waited to dig out. The police were informed of illegal hunting and use of quadbikes,” the activists claimed.\u0026nbspA fox was filmed narrowly escaping capture, they said, and video showed terriermen also apparently accompanying the hunt on quadbikes.Ten days later the trust website was updated to say all remaining dates for the South Shropshire had been cancelled for the 2018-19 season.National Dis-Trust said the South Shropshire Hunt was\u0026nbsp“still out for blood” elsewhere this week.The hunt said the allegations were untrue. Camilla Corrie, of the South Shropshire Hunt, told The Independent: “I understand there have been a number of unsubstantiated allegations made against us, but we continue to work closely with the National Trust and look forward to trail hunting in the near future.”\u0026nbspNational Dis-Trust also reported Shropshire’s United Pack to the trust for allegedly hunting on Long Mynd outside their licensed area and with quad bikes and terrier boxes.“They travelled directly across where the South Shropshire Foxhounds had marked a fox to ground the day before,” the group claimed.But a spokesperson from the United pack said: “The United operates within the law to comply with the Hunting Act 2004.The hunt works closely with all of their landowners, including the National Trust, to ensure they respect the wishes of the people whose land they cross, and are in discussions with the National Trust regarding the allegation that the hunt strayed out of their licensed area on the date in question.”Separately, just before Christmas the trust cancelled all dates for the Trinity Foot and South Herts Beagles but the reasons were unclear. The trust said it was because the date clashed with a deer cull at the Ashridge Estate but the hunt insisted it had always used the estate during annual culls.\u0026nbspA National Trust spokesman told The Independent: “This year we have concluded that, upon reflection, the area is not a suitable location to licence trail-hunting given the extensive deer management programme which takes place simultaneously.”Conducting the two activities at the same time at Ashridge was not compatible, he said. “Due to the ongoing issues surrounding the deer-management scheme, we will not be inviting future applications for trail-hunting on the estate.”The footage of a fox allegedly killed in Dorset emerged as thousands of Facebook users condemned footage of a rider from the Portman Hunt apparently kicking a horse in the stomach as he tried to mount it.\u0026nbspThe hunt said in a statement: “The Portman Hunt takes great pride in maintaining the highest standards of animal welfare. We are taking this very seriously and will deal with the matter internally.”Meanwhile, a businesswoman is trying to force local authorities to enforce rules that could prove an obstacle to hunt organisers.Barbara Wray says: “If I decided to run an event – say a community treasure hunt which was open to all members of the community, with children and adults on bicycles or segways, in wheechairs or on ponies … and I set the meeting point as outside the village pub ... I would have needed to have applied to the council for permission.”Ms Wray, who has qualifications in agriculture, says she has asked 12 councils so far whether hunts have applied for event permits but not one had said it had received an application. Some said it wasn’t their jurisdiction, others have not replied yet.She is starting a petition on Change.org, calling for hunts to be forced to apply for and be granted event permissions according to local council regulations and Health and Safety Executive guidelines and that they must supply risk assessments and proof of public liability before being allowed to meet on public land or highways.She said: “In addition the trail course must be submitted in advance, to the council for their approval – showing that horses and hounds will be kept well away from public highways.“Finally that trail hunts only permit horses, riders and hounds. No quad bikes or terriers should accompany the riders.”Last month Tetbury town council in Gloucestershire voted to ban the Beaufort Hunt, a favourite of Prince Charles, from its land.The Portman Hunt said it would fully co-operate with the police investigation into the apparent fox killing. A spokesperson said: “The hunt operates within the law to comply with the Hunting Act 2004.“Despite this, the hunt, along with many others across the country, is regularly subjected to spurious allegations of illegal hunting as part of a wider animal-rights agenda.”There were numerous clashes around the UK between hunters and protesters on Boxing Day and New Year’s Day as thousands turned out for hunt meets.The National Trust declined to comment on the cancelling of the South Shropshire licences.A spokesman said the United Pack was still licensed to trail-hunt on trust land “and we assume they will be using their one remaining licence date”.A spokesman for the Local Government Association said: “We are not aware that councils have a role overseeing hunts and clearly neither are the hunts, given none of them have submitted applications. If someone thinks that a contrary position is true, they should set out why and give some specific legal references.”The association has guidelines on how to stage public events, including obtaining council permission.The Countryside Alliance declined to comment on the idea of hunts obtaining permits from councils.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

The loss of faith people would have in our political system would be far greater than any other political or economic event in our lifetimes.”He added:\u0026nbsp“It would be a huge blow to our democracy that would be dangerous at a time when you look across the world with increasing strains and pressures.If people are told, ‘Sorry you got it wrong last time, you were too stupid or misled, you have to think again’, I think the country would be angry.”\u0026nbspBut he predicted that Leave would win any second vote, saying:\u0026nbsp“I think if there were another referendum Leave would win by an even bigger majority and be even stronger.”\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s petition for a Final Say referendum has been backed by more than 1.1 million people.Despite staunch opposition from many of his fellow Brexiteers in Parliament, Mr Gove insisted he was committed to helping secure MPs\u0027 support for Ms May\u0027s deal because “the alternatives would be playing with fire.He said: “A no-deal could be disastrous.“It could be less than 90 days away. The impact would be particularly bad for farmers.\u0026nbspTariffs of 40 per cent could be slapped on meat exports to the EU and subject to strict inspection regimes by the French. There would be hold-ups and delays at Calais and we could lose the benefits of leaving the common agricultural policy.”Despite Ms May having told Tory MPs\u0026nbspshe would not fight the next election and pressure on her to announce her resignation after Britain leaves the EU in March,\u0026nbspMr Gove predicted that she will still be prime minister this time next year and said he thought more highly of her now than he did when the pair\u0026nbspwere cabinet colleagues in David Cameron\u0027s government.He said: I respect her more now. She has shown an amazing deal of resilience, integrity and determination.

He confirmed he will remain in post and thinks it is important to continue working with Cabinet colleagues to ensure the best Brexit outcome for the country“If some of those MPs can be persuaded to back the prime minister’s deal, it won’t be because they’ve come under pressure to do so from their local party members over the Christmas break,” said Prof Bale.\u0026nbspThe study found that 59 per cent of Tory members opposed Ms May’s deal, compared to 38 per cent who supported it and 3 per cent who did not have an opinion.More than half, 53 per cent, also said that the deal “does not respect the result of the referendum”, comparing to 42 per cent who said that it does.People were then asked how they would vote in a referendum where there were three options – to remain, leave with the deal or leave without one – and in which they are able to put down a first and second preference.Some 57 per cent opted to leave with no deal as their first choice, with only 23 per cent putting Ms May’s deal and 15 per cent backing the option to remain in the EU.Forty per cent\u0026nbspthen put the prime minister’s proposals as their second choice, with 19 per cent putting no deal and 6\u0026nbspper cent opting to stay as a member of the bloc.The survey showed large majorities of members think both that a no-deal Brexit will have a positive impact on the economy in the medium to long term and that warnings of disruption have been exaggerated.A slim majority, 51 per cent, said they thought Ms May was doing “well”, but almost as many, 48 per cent said she was doing “badly” to some degree.But despite wavering support for Ms May and her deal, an overwhelming majority of members – 83 per cent – opposed the idea of having an election, while 82 per cent would not back a further referendum.Yesterday, the prime minister’s Northern Irish partners in government raised the stakes further in the Brexit talks, saying there is “no need” for key parts of the deal she agreed with the EU.Nigel Dodds, DUP deputy leader,\u0026nbspargued that the withdrawal agreement she is seeking “flies in the face” of the government’s own commitments relating to the border between the north and the republic.His comments came after a meeting in Downing Street, and are a blow to the prime minister as she desperately tries to convince the Northern Irish party and her own MPs to back her proposals ahead of a vote in the coming weeks.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We’ve just accomplished the most distant flyby.”Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said: “In addition to being the first to explore Pluto, today New Horizons flew by the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft and became the first to directly explore an object that holds remnants from the birth of our solar system.“This is what leadership in space exploration is all about.”The radio message from the robotic craft was picked up in Madrid by one of Nasa’s big antennas. The data took six hours and eight minutes to traverse the massive breadth of space between Ultima and Earth.According to Nasa, scientists had not discovered Ultima Thule when the probe was launched in 2006, meaning the mission was unique. In 2014, astronomers found Thule using the Hubble Space Telescope and selected it for New Horizon’s extended mission in 2015. “Anything’s possible out there in this very unknown region,” said John Spencer, deputy project scientist for New Horizons. Launched in January 2006, New Horizons embarked on a 4 billion mile journey towards the solar system’s frigid edge to study the dwarf planet Pluto and its five moons. The spacecraft, which is the size of a baby grand piano, flew past Pluto in 2015, providing the first close-up views of the planet. During the flyby, the probe found Pluto to be slightly larger than previously thought. In March, it revealed that methane-rich dunes were on the icy dwarf planet’s surface.After trekking 1 billion miles beyond Pluto into the Kuiper belt, New Horizons will now seek clues about the formation of the solar system and its planets.There is a great deal scientists can learn from Ultima and the hundreds of thousands of similar bodies scientists deem to be in the solar system. Hal Weaver, project scientist on the mission, told the BBC the rock is “probably the most primitive object ever encountered by a spacecraft, the best possible relic of the early solar system”. The object is officially known as 2014 MU69, but was nicknamed Ultima Thule, a Latin phrase which means “beyond the borders of the known world”.Additional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The EU will be guided through its many problems by a basket-case country with a pygmy economy, most of whose citizens are desperate to get the hell out and reach the UK.Every time you might doubt we did the right thing in voting to leave, the EU comes up with another brilliant reason not to stay in.Romania, with its beleaguered government and wealth per person lower than Trinidad  Tobago and Kazakhstan. That’s who will be running the show.Right now, though, we have to get our act together. In the middle of this month there will be a debate in Parliament about Theresa May’s “new” deal for us to leave the EU.Government ministers have been whispering that May has won some concessions from the EU negotiating team. I hope so. But I kind of have my doubts.As Lord Sugar might put it, she couldn’t sell prosecco to a hen party. But it’s time to get behind her. Time, too, for arch-Brexiteers to cease being so self-indulgent and vote through a deal that is the least-worst option.Sure, I’m no fan of Theresa’s Pedigree Chum plan ­— a dog’s dinnerever there was one. Truth be told, I’d rather we crashed out with no deal at all.But that would be more dangerous — for the British economy and even for Brexit.And waiting in the wingsthe Prime Minister fails to get her plan through is Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party.Frankly, I would rather stay in the EU than have Jezza as Prime Minister. As Tom Harris, a Labour Brexiteer, put it, May’s deal gives us Leavers slightly more than half of what we voted for. And given the result of the referendum two years ago, that seems about right to me. None of us get exactly what we want.But we do leave the EU and we retain control of our borders. And soon we’ll be free to strike our own, independent, trade deals. Reach out to the rest of the world. That seems to me a decent compromise.The problem lies in convincing the arch-Brexiteer Conservative MPs that now is the time to give up the fight. I understand their many reservations. But the reality is the deal May puts before the House of Commons is about the only solution that stands a chance of winning a majority.And we are in this position largely because the Tory Brexiteers never managed to sort themselves out. At every stage, they were ided among themselves and too often concerned about their political careers.Sothis isn’t the deal we all wanted, they have themselves to blame.Our negotiations with the EU should have been done with confidence and self-discipline.Instead, we were always on the back foot because of Conservative in-fighting.Now it’s time to get serious, at long last. Becausewe don’t push this deal through, we may not get Brexit at all.MY wish for the New Year is that someone might tell me what Kendall Jenner, Rita Ora and Ferne McCann actually do for a living. Other than this kinda thing.That’s wish No. Wish No is that Gary Lineker takes a self-awareness course and discovers he’s a bumptious t***er who knows next to nowt.Most of my social-media friends went to bed at pm to avoid seeing London Mayor Sadiq Khan’s ludicrous fireworks display.And all the downstairs lights were off in the houses in my street.Are people getting bored with New Year’s Eve, do you reckon Our Foreign Secretary has just landed in Singapore to drum up more trade for Britain post Brexit.This tiny country – just a city state – is a major economic force and an important ally.It’s also a good lesson for those whining lefties who blame colonialism for the desperate plight of Africa.Singapore was founded as a British trading post exactly  years ago. It was under British control until .It has a booming economy, one of the world’s highest le expectancies and a top standard of living.So it’s not done too badly, has it The truth is colonialism is NOTHING to do with the failure of African countries. It’s about good government.Theres going to be a gay bar in EastEnders.This is an innovation dreamed up by the new script editor, Kate Oates.It’s intended to make the programme more closely represent the area in which it’s set.Ha! Here’s a tip, Ms Oates. If you want EastEnders to truly reflect the borough in which it’s set – Tower Hamlets – you need a few more sweeping changes.Fewer than a third of Tower Hamlets’ residents are white British, so that’s most of the cast gone.Almost  per cent of the people there are Bangladeshi, so the programme should be broadcast in Bengali, not English.Come on, Kate. You want EastEnders to be more real Then make it REALLY real.Lets be honest. It’s not just whichever oaf parked Paul Pogba’s car in that disabled bay who is doing it.When I go to my local supermarket, all the disabled bays are full, every time.No stickers in the car windows.And the people inside the store don’t seem to be limping very much. Sometimes I fantasise about waiting by their cars, with a hammer, for them to emerge with their shopping.“Disabled, huh  Well, you are now.”But one of the problems, I think, is that we have too many disabled bays.And so people don’t take them seriously.Quite clearly, the French are doing nothing whatsoever to deter them.It wouldn’t surprise methey were actually herding them on to the dinghies.“Go on, monsieur, you can see the clfs over there. It’s not far. Bon voyage, mon ami.”It’s another two fingers from the hopeless French because we’re leaving the European Union.What we should be doing is towing the migrants all the way back to Calais.I know living in France is probably a “cruel and unusual punishment” under United Nations laws. But it’s time the French took their responsibilities a bit more seriously.Another year dawns with something  to be terried about.Evil Chinese mussels have invaded British waters, apparently. They smother our decent, God-fearing British scallops and oysters.By the time you read this, they will probably have made their way up the Thames.It’s time we took a stand against these vile, bivalved b******s.Leave our oysters alone, you Commies!

But the analysis warns that Britain’s second place is under “serious threat” from China due to its economic growth and naval investment.The rankings find Britain has retained its unique capacity to “project and extend itself around the world” and the audit also says Britain’s fundamental capacities have faced no “discernible impact” from Brexit.The audit’s chief analyst James Rogers said:“The pervasive spread of neo-declinism in Britain is wholly without foundation.Brexit has had no discernible impact on the UK’s fundamental ability to apply itself around the World.Although the UK is likely to retain its leadership role in Europe, it is also increasingly wedded to the so-called ‘Anglosphere’ - further investment in groupings like the Five-Eyes could help cement its successes.China’s rapidly expanding geopolitical capacity poses a serious challenge to the West. Over the past year, China has added tens of thousands of tonnes to its Navy andcurrent trends continue – it will overtake Britain as a global power by as soon as next year.If the rules-based order is breaking down, the UK should urgently invest in its armed forces’ projection capacities forward basing – not least in the Indo-Pacic region –it seeks to halt this sht.Urgent remedial action is also required – in  – to secure Britain’s continued economic, industrial and technological leadership.Without signicant new funding for Research and Development, the UK risks falling dangerously behind in the new technological race.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the US, impeachment is a formal charge of serious wrongdoing against the holder of public office.It is one of the few ways a sitting President can be kicked out of the White House before an election.The US Constitution states a President shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanours.The sole power of impeachment is held by the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress.A simple majority is required - i.e. more than half of Congressmen must vote to impeach the President.Its a never-before reached milestone in America’s history - but a number of Presidents have appeared to come close.The most recent was the nd president of the United States Bill Clinton, who was impeached in the House on two charges, one of perjury and one of obstruction of justice, on December , .However, when it reached the Senate in , it failed to get close to the two-thirds backing in needed to pass.The other was Andrew Johnson, who served as president for four years from .He was impeached by the House in  – just  days after he got rid of his secretary of war Edwin Stanton."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000459609972-e1546616452804.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"lightsaber sky international space station canada","story":"A bizarre new video shows the giant red laser shooting above homes on the outskirts of Edmonton, in Alberta.The sightings came after similar beams - one red and one green - were seen near the ISS in  and .Those to have witnessed the Canada light admit they have no idea what it was or where it came from.“What the hell is that ” asks one terried viewer as he zooms in on the incredibly bright sky phenomenon.Another believes the laser is linked to HAARP- a rumoured US military programme to manipulate weather.“It looks like a lightsaber in the sky,” remarks another to have seen the videos posted by conspiracy theory YouTube channel Secureteam.Other truthers were bizarrely convinced the clip was footage of an alien weapon in action.I know this may sound over the top, butyou think about, it could have been a laser,said Lord Reaper.However, many believe the lights could actually be a atmospheric phenomenon called light pillars - seen over Canada in the past.Although they look a lot like aurora, theyre not related to the Northern Lights, which are caused by electrically charged particles from space .Instead, light pillars occur in freezing temperatures when flat, hexagonal ice crystals form lower in the atmosphere than they usually would.When this happens, the crystals essentially form a collective, giant mirror, that can reflect a light source - such as city and car lights.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And there has been talk of a rt between Harry and his brother William and their wives.Meghan has also been accused of bombarding staff with am emails and displaying a demanding attitude toward staff — earning her the nickname “Duchess Dficult”.But former Hollywood lighting director Thomas, ,  said: “If there is any animosity between Meghan and Kate they should put their dferences aside. I’m very upset by the criticism Meghan is getting.“I don’t think she deserves it and I don’t think she is doing one third of the things she is being accused of doing.“I’m not buying that she made Kate cry. First off, I think Kate is a stronger woman than that.“I think Kate also knows she is in a stronger power position than Meghan is.“Kate’s the hero mother. I can’t see her being that weak.“No woman is who pops out a kid then walks out of hospital the same day.“I don’t think she’s afraid of anyone. And I don’t believe that Meghan is trying to hurt her in any shape or form. But at the moment I cannot call Meghan and say ‘What is going on  How can I help you ’“I need to know what the hell is happening and why it is happening. I need to know why she is being bashed every day.”Thomas, speaking exclusively to The Sun from his home in Rosarito, Mexico, said the wall of silence from Meghan was piling misery on him and the rest of his family.He  said: “This whole thing should have been one of the proudest moments of my le.“Now it’s like a dream that has turned into a nightmare. The royals and Meghan can help end this nightmare by simply giving me a call. To this day, I cannot think of anything I’ve done to deserve how I’m being treated now.“I’ve been a good father I’ve done nothing wrong. Axe murderers kill  people and their daughters still come and visit them in prison.“It’s just incomprehensible for Meghan to treat me this way.”Thomas had hoped to join Meghan’s mum Doria Ragland at the  wedding in Windsor last year but suffered a heart attack shortly before. And while recovering in hospital, he hung up on Harry, , during a heated row.The Prince had urged Thomas not to speak to the press — but he was caught co-operating with a paparazzi photographer.Harry told him: “This is what happens when you don’t listen to what we tell you to do.”But Thomas said: “I’ll keep talking and I’ll probably get louder. Meghan and Harry’s silence empowers all the crazy tweets and insults against me and my family.”Thomas admits he has made mistakes in the past, but said he is keen to make amends. He also hopes for an eventual first meeting with Harry. But today his message to him is: “Man up and get over it.“If I’m the first person who’s insulted you or hurt your feelings, you’ve got a long way to go.“He’s human just like the rest of us. I feel that he feels he is above everyone  and that he has a right to talk down to people.“And I cannot accept that. It feels like arrogance.”But despite the criticism of Meghan, , Thomas thinks she has settled into royal le.And he urged her new family to let her be herself. He said: “I now see her doing things she is comfortable with. I see her reaching out to people and hugging kids — because that is who she is.“If she’s able to continue doing that, it’s going to be fine — it takes away a little of the stuffiness.”He also said he is proud of seeing pregnant Meghan cradling her bump — and said he would love to play a part in the child’s le.But while Thomas remains proud of Meghan, he said he did not even get a Christmas card from her.He added: “On Christmas Day I visited some friends and received a lot of phone calls from every relative I have — except my daughter. I was prepared for it.”And he said he will carry on defending himself evenMeghan does get in contact with him. Thomas, also father to Tom Jr, , and daughter Samantha, , said: “I’ve been quiet long enough.“If they ever want to speak to me, maybe I’ll quieten down a little bit. But in the meantime I’m not going to become a monk in a monastery and take a vow of silence.“The bottom line is that I’ve done nothing to deserve this kind of treatment. I cannot cut my tongue out and never speak again. I can’t shut up because they have opened the door for a million people to criticise me and my family.”He said he feels the need to defend himself against online trolls attacking and misquoting him.He said: “One journalist claimed he had done a nine-hour interview with me. He came to pick me up for dinner with a female companion and was very unprofessional. I made him promise nothing could be used in a story.“The next day a story appeared. I do not want Harry and Meghan to believe I did the interview. They are the ones that told me not to believe everything you read.“In truth, there are a few journalists I have grown to trust and I use them to speak out from time to time.“I only speak because of the deadly silence from Meghan and the royals. No one was standing up for my family — so I had to.”Thomas ended his interview  by saying he plans to write a book “about the good years with my daughter and my fond memories of her growing up”.But the thing he wants most is reconciliation. He said: “I miss Meghan a lot. She was a big part of my le up until she met Harry.“But I don’t want pity. I remember my beautul daughter from the time she was born.“If she called me right now I would simply say ‘How have you been  I am glad to hear from you’.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Really I only ask because when the fly-by happened on New Year’s Day, the space craft was traveling at ,mph.This is known in technical circles as “very fast”.And think about it. If you try to take pictures of the underside of a motorway bridge as you pass by, you’re not going to learn much.And you’re only doing .So what nuggets of information came back from the edge of our solar system Ah well. Because the probe only has a -watt transmitter and because it’s four billion miles from earth and because the sun’s currently in the wrong place, we won’t have all the graphs and the algebra for  months.By which time, the boffins will have been given another gazillion dollars to go and look at another bit of frozen rock.I’m not one of those people who say the money should be spent on blankets for refugees.But can we stop pretending that space is a big encyclopaedia of facts we need to know Because it isn’t. The moon taught us nothing of any great consequence.Missions to Mars have given us nothing but a very good film starring Matt Damon and all we know about the bit between is that it’s cold and empty.Yes, further out, beyond the Thermal Shock Region, ten or five thousand galaxies from here, there could be all sorts of juicy titbits for the boffins to analyse.But we can’t get there.And we never will.Becauseyou were on a space ship that took off like the Enterprise, you’d fall over.So let’s concentrate our efforts on something which IS achievable.Turning space travel into the ultimate zero-g theme park ride for tourists.A CHINESE space craft landed on the Moon this week.I anticipate it will learn nothing of any great value but that, within a week, it will have built a factory that makes , pairs of training shoes every month.LIKE many other bores and cowards, I decided on New Year’s Eve to quit drinking for a little while.As I write, it’s lunch time on January  and already, a small rash has developed on my stomach.I looked it up on the internet and, of course, it’s cancer.I was going to have a drink to help me think about that but then I noticed that the pain in my hip is also cancer and so is my failing eyesight and so is my deafness and so is my wonky ankle and so is every symptom anyone has ever developed anywhere.As a research tool, the internet is brilliant. As a doctor, however, it’s scary . . . and almost always wrong.THERE are many noble and well-meaning attempts to make people stop filling the sea with bits of discarded plastic.Iceland, the supermarket chain, has started a “reverse vending machine” scheme which gives you a ten pence voucher for every empty plastic bottle you deposit.And there are many volunteers who comb the world’s coastlines, pulling plastic bags from the mouths of turtles and stranded dolphins.I wish all these people well.But I think a more targeted approach is necessary.Every time I go for a walk on Britain’s coastline, I notice that the high-tide mark is always littered with the plastic wrappers from milk chocolate Bounty bars and Flora margarine tubs.So how’s this for a plan You go to the people who make these things and you give them an ultimatum.Do something about it. Or we will do something to you, involving sharks.AS I watched the fireworks light up the night sky over London on New Year’s Eve, I wondered how long it would take someone to say the money should have been spent on the NHS.The answer, very depressingly, was about four seconds.Well, let me provide a retort.The amount of public money spent on the fireworks was £.million.Which isn’t even enough to buy one decent MRI scanner.Let me put it this way.You could save all your money for a rainy day and live on gruel.But it’s nice once in a while to spend a bit of it on beer and curry.MANY don’t enjoy the first few weeks of the year because it’s usually cold and dark and miserable.I love it though because all my friends are back from their Christmas holidays.Which means my Instagram feed is no longer full of their legs on a beach with nothing in the background but the blue sea and the bloody blue sky.I’M delighted to hear that Olivia Newton John isn’t as poorly as was reported earlier.I’ve always been a fan.Once, in fact, I wrote to Jim’ll Fix It askinghe could fix it for me to sleep with her.The filthy little pervert never even replied.THERE are so many exciting new things set to lt our spirits in .We have what will probably be the last Avengers movie and, a quarter of a century after the original, a new Toy Story.On the small screen, Game Of Thrones will be back and there will be world cups in rugby and cricket.The soundtrack will be provided by the Spice Girls reunion and . . .  none of you will be paying attention to any of it because this month, Theresa May’s useless Brexit deal will be dashed on the foreshore of democratic debate.This will cause Corbyn to propose a vote of no confidence which will trigger a general election.And the winner of that will stage a second referendum which will provide the same result as the first so there will be riots, petrol bombs, power cuts, death and the end of days.Despite this, though, I’d like to wish you all a happy New Year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Meghan and Harry’s silence empowers all the crazy tweets and insults against me and my family.”Thomas admits he has made mistakes in the past, but said he is keen to make amends. He also hopes for an eventual first meeting with Harry.But today his message to him is: “Man up and get over it.“If I’m the first person who’s insulted you or hurt your feelings, you’ve got a long way to go.“He’s human just like the rest of us. I feel that he feels he is above everyone  and that he has a right to talk down to people.“And I cannot accept that. It feels like arrogance.”He had hoped to join Meghan’s mum Doria Ragland at the  wedding in Windsor last year but suffered a heart attack shortly before. And while recovering in hospital, he hung up on Harry, , during a heated row.Thomas, also father to Tom Jr, , and daughter Samantha, , said: “I’ve been quiet long enough.“If they ever want to speak to me, maybe I’ll quieten down a little bit. But in the meantime I’m not going to become a monk in a monastery and take a vow of silence.“The bottom line is that I’ve done nothing to deserve this kind of treatment. I cannot cut my tongue out and never speak again. I can’t shut up because they have opened the door for a million people to criticise me and my family.”He recently urged his daughter to repair her rumoured rt with the Duchess of Cambridge, saying: “This just isn’t like her.”Meghan has been accused of reducing Kate to tears at a bridesmaid dress fitting before the royal wedding. And there has been talk of a rt between Harry and his brother William and their wives.Meghan has also been accused of bombarding staff with am emails and displaying a demanding attitude toward staff — earning her the nickname “Duchess Dficult”.But Thomas, ,  said: “If there is any animosity between Meghan and Kate they should put their dferences aside. I’m very upset by the criticism Meghan is getting.“I don’t think she deserves it and I don’t think she is doing one third of the things she is being accused of doing.“I’m not buying that she made Kate cry. First off, I think Kate is a stronger woman than that.“I think Kate also knows she is in a stronger power position than Meghan is.“Kate’s the hero mother. I can’t see her being that weak.“No woman is who pops out a kid then walks out of hospital the same day.“I don’t think she’s afraid of anyone. And I don’t believe that Meghan is trying to hurt her in any shape or form. But at the moment I cannot call Meghan and say ‘What is going on  How can I help you ’“I need to know what the hell is happening and why it is happening. I need to know why she is being bashed every day.”Thomas, speaking exclusively to The Sun from his home in Rosarito, Mexico, said the wall of silence from Meghan was piling misery on him and the rest of his family.He  said: “This whole thing should have been one of the proudest moments of my le.“Now it’s like a dream that has turned into a nightmare. The royals and Meghan can help end this nightmare by simply giving me a call. To this day, I cannot think of anything I’ve done to deserve how I’m being treated now.“I’ve been a good father I’ve done nothing wrong. Axe murderers kill  people and their daughters still come and visit them in prison.“It’s just incomprehensible for Meghan to treat me this way.”But despite the criticism of Meghan, , Thomas thinks she has settled into royal le.And he urged her new family to let her be herself. He said: “I now see her doing things she is comfortable with. I see her reaching out to people and hugging kids — because that is who she is.“If she’s able to continue doing that, it’s going to be fine — it takes away a little of the stuffiness.”He also said he is proud of seeing pregnant Meghan cradling her bump — and said he would love to play a part in the child’s le.But while Thomas remains proud of Meghan, he said he did not even get a Christmas card from her.He added: “On Christmas Day I visited some friends and received a lot of phone calls from every relative I have — except my daughter. I was prepared for it.”He said he feels the need to defend himself against online trolls attacking and misquoting him.He said: “One journalist claimed he had done a nine-hour interview with me. He came to pick me up for dinner with a female companion and was very unprofessional. I made him promise nothing could be used in a story.“The next day a story appeared. I do not want Harry and Meghan to believe I did the interview. They are the ones that told me not to believe everything you read.“In truth, there are a few journalists I have grown to trust and I use them to speak out from time to time.“I only speak because of the deadly silence from Meghan and the royals. No one was standing up for my family — so I had to.”Thomas ended his interview  by saying he plans to write a book “about the good years with my daughter and my fond memories of her growing up”.But the thing he wants most is reconciliation. He said: “I miss Meghan a lot. She was a big part of my le up until she met Harry.“But I don’t want pity. I remember my beautul daughter from the time she was born.“If she called me right now I would simply say ‘How have you been  I am glad to hear from you’.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is extraordinarily irresponsible and self-contradictory.He added the backstop was a “con trick” to keep the UK tied to Brussels rules.“On the one hand the Government is preparing to leave on WTO terms, while pretending that its preparations will be unsuccessful and disastrous.”Leading Tory Eurosceptic Tory Steve Baker gave his wholehearted support to the report and said leaving on WTO terms would end the “corrosive uncertainty” about Britain’s future.Theresa May pulled the vote on her deal before Christmas amid claims more than  Tory MPs were ready to vote against it – largely over concerns the UK will be tied to EU customs rules for years to come.Hardline Brexit-backing Tories agreed to an uneasy truce after the PM survived a no confidence challenge in her leadership last month.But, an-ex Cabinet Minister said they believed MORE Tory MPs were prepared to vote down the PM’s deal and accept a clean break with the EU – given the step up in preparations on both sides of the Channel.They added: “I don’t know anyone on our side whose views have changed over the Christmas break. If anything people are now more resolved to vote against.”A No. spokesman said: “As a responsible Government, we are preparing for all eventualities. But we think the best thing for this country is to leave with a good deal.”Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lamont added: “The government’s strongest card in negotiating a good free trade deal with the EU is its willingness to leave on WTO terms.“It is extraordinary that they should be talking down that possibility which as this paper shows has been absurdly demonised.“The Government seem desperate to scare people into accepting the unsatisfactory EU terms and to swallow the Withdrawal Agreement.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Seaborne Freight Chief Operating Officer Glenn Roy Dudley was previously a company director at International Traders Ferry Limited. That firm was, while he was a director in -, incorporated offshore in the British Virgin Islands, at an address listed as Havelet Trust CompanyLtd. But Mr Dudley insists it was not registered offshore for tax reasons, but for protection from animal rights activists. He told the Mirror: “I was approached by a consortium of farmers to operate a livestock service to Dieppe. This was at a time when animal rights activists were sending letterbombs to firms operating live animal exports.”   He added: “It had to be in the British Virgin Islands because we were all being hounded by animal rights activists. It was absolutely not for tax reasons, it was because we needed the anonymity.” Andy McDonald MP, Labour’s Shadow Transport Secretary, said: “Awarding a public contract to a firm run by someone who has historic links with tax havens is typical from the Tories. “With every passing day the depth and scale of the Transport Secretary’s irresponsibility becomes ever more evident. “It’s clear that Chris Grayling failed to undertake the necessary checks and due diligence on Seaborne Freight and its directors. His ministerial incompetence is a disgrace to the country.” Mr Dudley confirmed the business was registered with a so-called “brass plate” firm - an empty office which multiple firms used as their legal address. He said he withdrew from the firm when the mad cow disease crisis took hold, and livestock exports collapsed. He understands the firm still exists, but is not active.   The Department for Transport says both department officials and “highly reputable independent third party organisations with signicant experience and expertise” performed due diligence on Seaborne Freight before awarding the contract. But asked by the Mirror who the third party organisations were, they refused to say. Meanwhile, it has been claimed Seaborne Chief Executive Officer Ben Sharp once ran a shipping company that ceased trading with more than a million pounds of debts and a huge unpaid tax bill. He was previously Managing Director of Mercator International, which provided charter ships and armed escort vessels for ships sailing the Indian Ocean, where piracy is re. But suppliers in the region claimed the firm still owed them money when it collapsed, according to Channel  News. The firm was placed in administration as a result of legal action taken by HMRC in  over a signicant tax bill. Mr Sharp told the Times: “The directors of Seaborne Freight are experienced business people with a long track record in industry. They have, between them, opened and in some cases closed, a number of businesses. This is of course not unusual.

But the principal reason why stores are struggling is the competition from online retailers. Our High Street Fight Back campaign led to ministers launching a poundmillion fund to help town centres. While welcome, this falls far short of what is necessary to revive the retail sector and stop the loss of even more jobs. We are still waiting for a promised digital sales tax. Action could be taken now on parking charges, business rates and planning laws. Above all, we need to stop online giants using complex accounting practices to avoid paying their fair share in tax.

Casey King, , bared all for reality series Family by the Ton , which focuses on subjects who are dangerously overweight , and the struggles their families face. On Wednesday the American revealed he is unemployed and living with his father, Danny, who has to wait on him hand and foot. He said: A normal day for me is to wake up around , figure out something I am going to eat immediately, [and then] TV, video games, bed. Its not a lot of activity. I will just eat till Im dead.  Not only does Casey play videos games all day in the heat of his home state of Georgia, but he is also forced to strip off because his clothes dont fit him. He said: Its hot in Georgia, and all my clothing is restricting and tight, so I just sit there naked, free as can be and no one bothers me — doors shut, were good. Since becoming too big to work, Casey has thrown himself in to video games because the virtual world is the only one he feels comfortable in, he admitted.  BREAKING Horsley train murder: Man arrested after dad kned to death He added: Im accepted in all those virtual reality worlds and the gaming world Im in. No one sees me. That is my outside. That is my world that I can be the Casey I want to be, but not be judged on my weight. I never wouldve thought at  Id be living with my father, and Id have no job, have no real money, and just be playing video games all day and eating.  After graduating high school he worked at a series of restaurants, which saw him balloon from lbs to lbs in a matter of months. But when his weight made it too hard for him to work , his mother threw him out. His obesity further spiralled out of control when he was forced to live with his father, where the daily menu featured only fast food - in large quantities.  He said: I was probably around lbs then, and it was just getting too dficult to work, so I quit my job. My mom said to live in this house, you have to have a job, so she kicked me out. The only place I had left to go was my fathers, so I went there. Basically, his one thing that he knew made me happy as food, so we just ate like kings, but, like, in the worst way — pizzas, chicken, Japanese food, takeout. I mean, me and my dad would get hibachi delivered, sushi by the barrel. I mean, just anything you wanted to eat, we were getting. Casey admitted that he has gotten stuck in the shower a couple of times. One time he was left sitting there for about nine hours, and he couldnt ask his father to get him up. After telling his dad that he was afraid of getting stuck again, Danny bought him a large metal trough, which he placed on their back deck.  He explained: I bathe outside in this trough, currently, because I cannot physically bathe in a sit-down bathtub or a stand-up shower area. Because I am a bigger guy with, like, folds and flaps, I have to move around, almost like a pig in a way, and wallow and roll over to get the back of my leg. I have to lt up literal pieces of skin. Its just a super dficult process. Although Casey and his father were close, Danny admitted that taking care of his adult son could be frustrating for him.  Danny told the TLC channel: It gets old, and I get tired of it. He should be more active, but hes not. Hes just there. I wait on him hand and foot, and I shouldnt do it, but I do. I love him to death. Hes my son and I feel obligated to wait on him. Casey heartbreakingly admitted his father has even started bathing him, after he became too fat to reach some parts of his body. He said: I am at a size to where I need him to help me do things that just no parent wants to be doing when you are in your s. I need his help a little bit to clean myself, you know, wiping just my a** because, I mean, I cant reach everything on my back and I cant reach everything below me. So, you know, its whatever.

David Blicharz, , spilled lager over fellow passengers and reduced children to tears after he went berserk at , feet. His outburst happened when staff aboard a two and a half hour Jet flight from Turkey to Manchester refused to serve him any more alcohol. During the journey from Antalya, Blicharz, who worked for a business travel consultancy, told air hostess Kayla Stanbury she was a mother f***er and f***ing stupid as she and other cabin crew urged him to behave. He also began arguing with his girlfriend before being made to sit at the back of the aircraft until it landed at Manchester Airport.Other passengers were so fed up of his swearing they offered to help restrain him, a court heard. Blicharz, who was arrested on touchdown, later claimed he got drunk after a problematic and costly trip away with his partner and two children which became embroiled in a series of arguments and worsened as they were about to go home. But in a statement one of the crew members said it was the worst abuse they had ever encountered on a flight.  At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Blicharz of the citys Whalley Range district admitted being drunk on an aircraft and was today jailed for four months. He has lost his job since the incident on November  last year and his relationship has broken down, a court heard. Prosecuting, Zoe Dawson said: The defendant had embarked on a Jet aircraft flying from Antalya to Manchester but was found to be displaying drunk and disorderly behaviour. He was moved several times during the flight and he continued to upset other passengers with his abusive language and behaviour. This lasted for around two and a half hours. At one point it was stated by the crew members that he spilt alcohol on another passenger and was moved as a result. Cabin staff stated children were upset and crying, listening to the behaviour. He was purchasing drink on board until one member of staff decided to halt any further purchases. She states she was asked by the defendanthe could purchase further alcohol, he was told she would not serve him and he would have to wait. She said she would go and deal with other members on the aircraft instead of him at that juncture. Because of this he ignored the cabin crew assistant called Kayla Stanbury and approached another member of the cabin crew. He ignored what she said and moved to the back, and approached another staff member to purchase alcohol. She, thereafter, went to confront the defendant, she spoke to him about the fact he had ignored her and purchased alcohol. At this point the defendant referred to her as a trolley dolly with stupid red lips. She then asked for his passport and he called her a mother f***er.  Miss Dawson said the defendant shouted and swore at the stewardess and other members of staff. She told a court there was more than one announcement by the Captain expressing an iniduals behaviour was unacceptable. Miss Dawson added: Considerable time and thought was given as to whether it was appropriate to redirect the aircraft. That decision was not made. Eventually staff members were able to take the defendant to the rear of the aircraft and he sat with members of staff for the duration of the flight. During the incident other passengers offered to assist the crew because of the extreme behaviour of the defendant, that they felt necessary to ask whether they needed help restraining the defendant. On landing the police arrived at the aircraft, but earlier the captain radioed ahead regarding his behaviour. In mitigation, defence lawyer Simon Blakebrough said: The aircraft was not put in any immediate risk, though it could have been. The background to what went on is that his relationship was not going very well. He went on holiday with his partner and her two teenage children. It cost a lot of money, and there were many problems on the holiday. There were arguments during the holidays, particularly when they were planning to go home to the UK. He had a little bit to drink before getting on the plane. He did drink more alcohol on it. He had a row with his partner in the seats they were allocated, so he asked to move to the front of the plane and the crew accommodated.  The defence lawyer continued: He was served alcohol in that seat and he drunk it. He asked for some further alcohol to be served to him. He then went to the back, but said the crew wouldnt serve him. Things escalated quickly as they tried to take the alcohol off him. He accepts his behaviour fell far below what it should be. His behaviour was in front of cabin crew, children and other passengers, and he accepts it would have caused them signicant distress. He has indicated remorse. He is appalled by his behaviour and would like to apologise to all concerned. He is sorry for any inconvenience and distress he has caused. He has since abstained from alcohol completely. He was working for some years in a business travel agency. He is fluent in German and Polish. He has lost his current job because of these offences, he has lost his good character and his relationship is over. He has expressed remorse at what has happened and wishes to put this behind him. Sentencing the judge Mr Recorder Andrew Nuttall told Blicharz: The aircraft was filled with passengers many of whom had been on holiday and your behaviour was one of drunkenness and abuse, in particular towards the senior stewardess who you were particularly abusive to. You called her a mother f***er, a trolley dolly with stupid red lips, f***ing stupid and other such appalling language. You had been moved from your seat on more than one occasion. It was noted children were present on board the flight, who were clearly concerned with your behaviour and it is highly likely they would have been frightened. Its well known that travelling on an aircraft lies a special duty with passengers to behave. They are confined in a small area for a y period of time. He added: The safety of passengers may well be put in jeopardy over a relatively small incident which could have catastrophic consequences. People are entitled to have an uneventful flight which they have usually paid a great deal of money for. In cases like this, courts make clear a punishment of immediate imprisonment should reflect a deal of deterency. You have said you hold remorse for your behaviour and you have presented that you have gained counselling. You have a good record and are fluent in two languages. You are described as extremely competent and have excellent scholastic accomplishments. However, this offence is too serious for anything other than a custodial sentence. Upon leaving the dock, Blicharz said to the Judge: Thank you.

Speaking to The Sun, Thomas said this time should be the proudest moments of his le as the newlywed Duchess of Sussex prepares to welcome her first child in spring.

To this day, I cannot think of anything I’ve done to deserve how I’m being treated now. I’ve been a good father I’ve done nothing wrong.

The sperm of  men whose shypartners had experienced three or more consecutive miscarriages was compared to that of men whose partners had not had one. Their samples had higher levels of DNA damage, the study found. Recurrent miscarriage affects around one in  couples and is defined as the consecutive loss of three of more pregnancies before  weeks. Until recently it was thought to be caused by health issues with the mother such as infection or immune problems.  Dr Channa Jayasena, lead author of the Imperial College London study, said: “A growing body of evidence suggests sperm health dictates pregnancy health.” DNA damage may be caused by too high levels of reactive oxygen species, molecules that are meant to protect sperm from infection.

The royal secretly agreed to be with Marines in Norway, who are training shyto repel an invasion. A source said: Harry will be totally immersed in the exercise. As tensions between the West and Russia grow to almost Cold War levels, the Duke will be present in the country as the marines practice drills in a show of strength against potential military strikes by shyMoscow And the war veteran is said to be relishing joining the Royal Marines on the front line of an arctic exercise aimed at warning Vladimir Putin that Britain and her allies have the power to hit back. Harry has secretly agreed to join more than , elite commandos shypractising a counter-attack against a Russian invasion of Norway, which lies on Europe’s northern flank against Russia and is vulnerable to invasion.  Sources say the -year-old former Army Captain, who is also head of the Royal Marines, will spend time visiting the marines while the multi-million pound war games are taking place over  weeks, signed off by Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. A senior military source said: “Prince Harry will be totally immersed in the exercise, and he will be privy to top-secret battle plans. “It will be high-tempo, extremely rshyealistic and his involvement is good news for the Marines, who will see his involvement as a very positive message of shyencouragement to the Corps. “They are the main force who will protect Europe’s northern flank in the event of a conflict, the tip of the spear, and it is important Harry is among the troops.” The Duke of Sussex, who fought in Afghanistan as a Cavalry officer and Apache helicopter pilot, has told his closest confidants of his excitement at being back in the military fold. A palace source said: “The duke is relishing his role with the Royal Marines and taking it extremely seriously.  “His grandfather Prince Philip carried out his duty with the Marines with such distinction, which Harry particularly admired. “Throughout his military career, Harry always had the greatest of respect and admiration for the Marines and he has always been fascinated by their valour and courage.” The Norway manoeuvres will be the biggest Arctic military exercise by the Royal Marines in decades. It comes amid escalating Russian aggression towards Europe, with Cold War levels of submarine activity reported in the Northern Atlantic and frequent air incursions on UK airspace. And since Putin’s Novichok attack on former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury last year, tensions between London and Moscow have been on a kne-edge.  Harry, dubbed “H” by the Marines, will fly from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire to Norway in the coming weeks. The prince, expecting his first child with -year-old we Meghan, will be taken to a remote base to join British troops from  Commando, American, Dutch and Norwegian combat marines. Including forces from the US and Europe, , soldiers will be involved. Royal Marines started travelling to Norway on New Year’s Day from their base at Bickleigh Barracks in Devon. The country, along with Finland and Sweden, is on Europe’s front line against Russia and is a potential site of an invasion by Moscow. During the exercise, special forces will be shyparachuting or travelling in by boat. Light-armoured Marine vehicles will move in, there are expected to be mortar, rocket, artillery and anti-tank attacks and Marines will ski into action. Accomplished skier Harry will be given every access to all areas of the designated battleground.  Over several days he will be briefed at every stage of the “battle” which will include special forces and commandos spearheading a retaliation against Russian attack. The troops are expected to hold the Northern Flank until British and US reinforcements arrive. Harry’s involvement is not due to be shyofficially announced and the Mirror has agreed not to publish sensitive details of his movements. The prince took on the role of Captain General of the Royal Marines from Prince Philip in December  after he retired as a frontline Apache pilot. In Afghanistan, Harry worked closely with Marines from  Commando. He has killed Taliban fighters and an shyinsurgent commander revealed they had planned to kidnap Harry. The Royal Marines’ new role as the lead element of Britain’s Joint shyExpeditionary Force puts them in the front line in any potential miliary conflict with Russia.

The cutting-edge technology is known as ‘Invisible-to-Visible’, or IV, and could entirely change the way we drive. As well as projected avatar passengers demonstrating the best way to drive, the future-tech can even show scenery of a sunny day in the vehicle – when it’s actually raining. The interactive, D display also contains a system using sensors inside and out to anticipate upcoming obstructions. Tetsuro Ueda, an expert leader at the Nissan Research Centre, said: “By helping you see the invisible, IV enhances your confidence and makes driving more enjoyable. “The interactive features create an experience that’s tailored to your interests and driving style so that anyone can enjoy using it in their own way.”  In what Nissan are calling the ‘Metaverse’ – the virtual world that autonomous cars can connect to – it will even be possible for family, friends or others to appear inside the car as three-dimensional, augmented-reality avatars to provide company or assistance. The ‘Metaverse’ maps a -degree virtual space around the car to provide information about things like road and intersection status, visibility, signage or nearby pedestrians.

Darwin Red Cloud made the remarks as he was sentenced this week to four years in prison following the death of his two-month-old son, Dalton, in . He pleaded guilty to second degree murder at an earlier hearing where pictures of the baby boy with “every bone sticking out” were deemed too distressing to show a courtroom. US attorney Sarah Collins said: There are photos that haunt me and this is one of the cases. Red Cloud, , from Rapid City, South Dakota, was originally charged with sexual abuse of a minor, however the charge was dismissed in a plea agreement as well as first degree murder, felony child abuse and neglect charges, according to US media.  The age of the unnamed mother is not known. It was argued in court he was unaware she was underage, but attorney Ms Collins said there was sufficient evidence he knew her age. The court was also told how Red Cloud had “behaved terribly” in jail and that he had a record of four assaults there, spraying disinfectant on other inmates and threatening staff, reports News Center . But Betsey Harris, representing Red Cloud, argued he had learning dficulties and endured a traumatic childhood, growing up without a father.  She added that he didn’t have the “insights to have a baby and to care for a child” and that the death was the result of a “confluence of circumstances,” News Center  added. Red Cloud told the hearing: I’m sorry. I’m not perfect. I’m a human being whose made mistakes. “I may not be the smartest but I know I can do better. I should’ve paid attention more. I’m sorry. Chief Judge Jeffrey L Viken said this case was “highly unusual” and it was “hard to comprehend the signs were missed by so many”. After the hearing, Red Cloud’s sister, Angie Red Cloud, said she didn’t think the baby showed any signs of emaciation.  She said the mother would “bring him down to the house every other day” and says there were a lot of small babies in their family. Red Cars cousin, Kaitlin Catches, also took to Facebook to defend him, reports the .According to the online publication, she wrote: These reporters wanted to know the bad. But I’m so glad the judge seen the good in my cousin  decided to be lenient. No matter what the records or his dysal baby momma said, HE IS NOT A MONSTER!  I’m glad I took the stand to tell these ppl [sic] who HE IS! I don’t want my cousin to take the full responsibility but he is because he knows he was a parent. Although he isn’t the only parent, he chose to own up to it. The prosecutor was trying to make him sound like a monster  give him no less than years. I’m so thankful he will be home soon  able to get the help he needs. Our nightmare is over!!

We controlled the game and had chances to score the second.“We didn’t and then we concede two goals and that is not good. If we want to be top of this league we cannot repeat this mistake.”Painful as the unexpected defeat was, he believes what’s vital now is United put the disappointment of what was only a second defeat since Neilson took charge in October, behind them as quickly as possible.And with home games against Partick Thistle and Dunfermline coming up over the next two Saturdays, he wants the focus to be on what lies ahead and not what’s just gone.“We now just have to think about the next game. We have two games coming now at home and we must think about that and make sure we win them.“Alloa was a very big disappointment but there is still half of the season for us to play and we must put things right. We must keep going and be strong for the rest of the season.“We have been good in most home games and we must make sure that continues.”Since his arrival near the end of the summer transfer window on a two-year contract at Tannadice, Bouhenna has impressed as a hard-tackling centre-half who can also play when he is moving forward with the ball at his feet.Saturday past, however, saw him moved into a midfield holding role and despite the result, put in an impressive performance.For him that change of role was about doing what was needed for the team.“I have played before some games in the midfield. Fraser Fyvie was injured and I will play there because you must always do what is needed for the team.“It was not a surprise because when I came here I played some games in midfield and when the manager asked me to play there I was happy to do it for the team.“I have played some games there during my career. Centre-back is my best position, of course, but I knew I could help the team there and I did it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee council spends 1m to repair vandalised property","story":"Dundee City Council has had to spend more than £ million to repair vandalised property in the last six years.Since April , £. million has been spent repairing everything from play equipment to school property and

though the full-back is himself free to speak to other clubs this month with his own contract ending in the summer.And the desire to stay in the top flight,a new offer from the Dark Blues isn’t forthcoming, is likely to see Kerr weigh up his options.With his side rock bottom of the Premiership during the winter break, Jim has repeated the need to bring in the “right types” to get the side out of relegation trouble – something he did in similar circumstances at County.And that could mean moving for players he’s worked with before knowing exactly what they will bring with October signing

squad not good enough to win promotion in the wake of the defeat at Alloa last week, boss Robbie Neilson has been hard at work this week to bring in some of the players he’d already targeted for the January transfer window.He will team up again with young striker Aidan Nesbitt, who played under Robbie during their spell at MK Dons.The -year-old signed yesterday on a deal until the end of the season.mdash Dundee United FCJanuary , Nesbitt told the United website: #It#s a big club, and I am delighted to be here. The aim is to play football regularly with the goal of helping United reach the Premiership and hopefully secure a longer deal.#Neilson said: #Aidan is someone I know well. I paid money to take him to MK Dons and his first season was excellent.#It hasn#t worked for him under a new manager down there, but I see him as the type of creative player who can help us produce more in the final third of the park.#Another possible target is midfielder Ian Harkes, who was recently released by MLS side DC United, where he’s been a team-mate of Wayne Rooney.Harkes, , is the son of former USA international John and qualies to play in this country because he was born in England during his father’s time with Derby County.By next week they could also be joined by former Tangerines favourite Morgaro Gomis. The  Scottish Cup winner has been training with the squad since hisfrom a spell in the Middle East.Other than -year-old Gomis, the manager has refused to identy any potential signings until deals are complete.Nesbitt#s arrival will move striker Craig Curran closer to a switch to team up with his former boss, Jim McIntyre, at Dundee.The Liverpudlian has not been a regular starter since switching from Ross County in the summer and, while he’s in contention for a place tomorrow,United make the signings they want, he’s likely to be allowed to go.“There’s interest in quite a few of the players and, obviously, Jim’s got a big relationship with Craig and we’ll see how that goes in the next few weeks,” said Robbie.“I really like Craig, he’ll be involved with us tomorrow and ultimately time will tell.”A number of players have already been told they are no longer part of the plans. Until departures are confirmed, Robbie would not name names.It’s believed, though, that one of them is defender-cum-midfielder Adam Barton, while winger Yannick Loemba is another who’s not likely to be seen again in tangerine.Since Robbie took charge in October, former Jag Barton has had just  minutes of game time via two sub appearances.He’s set to move back to England where he’s spent most of his career.Loemba’s time on the pitch has been even more limited under the new boss and amounts to a four-minute appearance against Inverness in October.Like Barton, the Congolese-born Belgian passport holder only arrived in the summer. With signings set to continue, there will be more departures.“It’s like anything in football, we need to move people in and we need to move people out,” added Robbie."},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee defender jack hendry to leave celtic on loan","story":"Former Dundee defender Jack Hendry is set to leave Celtic on loan this month.Since departing Dens for a club-record fee last January, Hendry has struggled to command a regular starting spot at Parkhead and the club are keen to give him game time where.Ato the Dark Blues, however, is unlikely with clubs down south lining up to take Hendry on a temporary deal.Jack Ross’s Sunderland head the pack with fellow League One challengers Bradford and Portsmouth also keen to add the former Wigan man to their ranks.The -year-old hasn’t featured for Celtic since the - Europa League defeat to RB Salzburg on October .In his short spell at Dundee, Hendry made just  appearances before Celtic secured him in a seven-figure deal."},{"url":null,"title":"familys horror as childrens ride on toy car bursts into flames in dundee","story":"An investigation has been launched after a children’s ride-on toy car burst into flames in Dundee.The one-year-old Mercedes model, bought from leading UK-wide company Kids Cars Direct, burned out in less than  minutes on Boxing Day.The customer, Pauline Thomson, said she was “in shock” after watching the flames suddenly take hold while the car was sitting in the family’s front garden.Fortunately, the car was not occupied by any of the family’s three children at the time.Pauline said the family, who live in Broughty Ferry, are all “relieved” no one was hurt.She said: “The kids were playing with it but it ran out of charge so they left it under a tree in the garden.“Just minutes later, flames were leaping out of it.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"woman admits acting intimidating manner","story":"NewsWoman admits to acting in intimidating mannerThe -year-old shouted, swore and acted in an aggressive and intimidating way towards Shannon Kerr.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  DEC NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has admitted to acting in an intimidating manner.

For Deborah Biggar has just got a whole chunk smaller. The -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier. Deborah, of Dalmellington, revealed a Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis meant she was put on steroids at age just . Even after the first round of steroids she put on two stone. And she said: “I realised I had to do something or my weight would soon be out of control.” She’d kept active as a community support officer and loved horse riding - but had to get out the saddle as her mobility reduced.   Deborah said: “Riding was something I absolutely loved, and also walking, and with this loss of regular activity, I was definitely going to be up against keeping the weight off.” She took the plunge and joined the Coylton branch of WW . She revealed: “I turned up alone and felt very apprehensive. “Due to my illness this wasn’t an easy thing for me to do, as I can be very self-conscious and don’t often go many places on my own, but I needn’t have worried.” Class wellness coach Kellie Brown and her team quickly put Deborah at ease, and she has now only missed one workshop since joining.   During her battle her weight has snowballed up and down as her medications changed. She said: “I am delighted with my weight loss so far as I am feeling much better, not just physically, but I think more importantly, mentally I am in a better place. Going out I do not feel as self-conscious and my confidence is now a lot better. “I went to my nephew’s wedding a happier and much more confident and content person, and looked forward to it, instead of dreading going. “This is all thanks to Kellie and the group I attend at Coylton and this time I will be continuing to attend workshops to help keep me on track.” She tracks calories with an online WW app as she trawls supermarket aisles.   Deborah said: “I love the fact there are so many zero smartpoint foods, and I eat out quite regularly. As long as I track everything and make sensible decisions, I can still lose weight no problem. I sometimes choose what I’m having before I go with the help of my app. I don’t have a sweet tooth so saying no to desserts and cakes is an easy decision for me.” Fatty foods like chips and fried meals have been swapped for fruit, veg, chicken and home-made soup. Trips out are now anxiety free. She revealed: “I am no longer thinking that people are thinking she is only using a stick or scooter because she is fat but they actually see I have a disability. “With my weight loss I am on the list for the Riding for the Disabled Association, and my fingers are crossed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pet-of-the-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, is Bea.The charity told us: \"Bea is a beautul six-year-old Corn Snake who came in to us as her owners no longer had the time or space for her.\"Bea has not had much handling and is a bit shy and grumpy because of this, so would be best suited to an experienced owner who can help her learn to trust people.\"Bea has been eating well while with us and appears to be a healthy girl, so given the chance were sure she will make a great pet.\"If you would like to offer Bea her forever home, please call Borders Pet Rescue on   or email info@borderspetrescue.org.\""},{"url":null,"title":"get-a-first-glimpse-of-the-new-improved-eastgate","story":"PLANS for transforming the Eastgate Theatre are set to go on show.A huge fundraising effort by supporters of the theatre reached the required pound, target for theatre bosses to access further financing streams.And now the ambitious plans to improve the auditorium, as well as future projects, will be revealed during the first weekend of January.Maggie Mackay, marketing manager at the Eastgate, told us: \"During both days everyone is invited to visit the theatre where there will be an opportunity to test sample seats, see artist impressions of options to bring the side galleries into full use and talk with representatives from the Project Design Group about these designs, the planned timetable for the work and the ambition to move onto the next development phase -

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

We have strong institutions and professions. We have lots of natural strengths. But they will be eroded at a pace that will scare uswe are not awake to this threat.Mr Murray said there were no longer any ldquountouchables in Scotland but warned that there was a danger of a long-term ldquodrag on the nationrsquos economygangster infiltration was not stopped.The investigator said the profits of Scotlandrsquos multi-billion drugs industry were not increasingly being laundered at home, in the new corporate equivalent of traditional cash ldquosafe houses.The old safe houses were properties where bulk cash could be stored before being laundered abroad.Mr Murray explained: ldquoCompanies are now being acquired to take the place of safe houses.ldquoThere is always a reason for cash to be in companies. The companies themselves may have an entirely legitimate business but it provides an effective shelter for these funds which are then drawn in through a network of associated companies. This can then provide a story of value or a source of income for organised crime players.ldquoYou could always tell the sort of companies associated with organised crime. Taxi, security and logistics firms, tanning salon and nail bars.ldquoWe are beginning to move away from that now. What we are seeing is that for the serious players in organised crime and looking to acquire business with a good track record, training and good reputation in marketplace.ldquoThe typical scenario is they identity a company which has all of these characteristics but for whatever reason has run in to cash flow dficulties.ldquoIn general, the central belt of Scotland has always been resilient to outside influences. Increasingly the senior players in Scottish organised are engaging with international service providers.One of those foreign iniduals has himself acquired a business in exactly the way I have described.ldquoI think that could be as a result of wishing to de-risk from being directly involved in the physical carriage of drugs.Scotland has increasingly become known overseas as the new Switzerland - with its shell companies offering the same kind of opportunities to hide illicit cash as Swiss bank accounts once did.Mr Murray, however, is not talking about shell companies, such as Scottish limited partnerships, which tend to bank overseas. He is talking about the purchase by gangsters of real-world business which employ real people and do real business in Scotland.And he believes the consequences for failing to deal with this criminalisation could be grave. Mr Murray said: ldquoThe fundamental penalty for allowing an accumulation of criminal cash in the economy is that it is a drag on the economy. It undermines competitiveness, it discourages legitimate players from entering those markets. If it becomes a growing theme in Scotland, it is bound to affect inward investment.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming.

Equally crucial are other issues that have vexed women for decades,not centuries, among them equality of pay, professional respect and opportunity.So far, so reasonable. Yet, when I heard Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland, talking last week about Mothers of Invention, a podcast she has set up that focusses exclusively on womenrsquos efforts to address climate change, my heart did a double skip: one for delight, two for despair. Delight that women are getting involved directly in trying to help reduce our carbon footprint, without a doubt the most urgent of the worldrsquos ails, but despair at Robinsonrsquos smug assumption that ldquoitrsquos women who change behaviour, in the family and the community.Letrsquos put aside for a moment the fact that, as Robinson reveals in her recent book, Climate Justice, her own awareness of environmental calamity dawned on her like a Damascene conversion astonishingly late in the day. What sets my teeth on edge is the sanctimonious way in which women are increasingly frequently being portrayed ndash mostly by other women. Itrsquos asthere is a collective halo that needs constant polishing, lest it lose its lustre. Indeed, it seems you cannot these days be a female in a position of influence or authority without feeling the urge ndash or the pressure ndash to add a stone to the cairn of womenrsquos rights, entitlements and endeavours.Donrsquot misunderstand me. I am an old-style feminist, and decry utterly the unfair, oppressive and sometimes iniquitous treatment of women in our and other societies. Men have an awful lot to answer for, today and in the past. But I get decidedly uneasy at the perceptual ide that appears to be widening between the sexes. Climate change, said Robinson, is ldquoman-made, and she enjoys using the term, even though admitting it embraces men and women. But apart from this deliberate provocation, is she really correct in assuming that women change attitudes more widely than men Maybe it depends on what sort of country yoursquore living in. When I look around the UK, I donrsquot recognise that stark distinction. Plenty of men seem to be trying to bring about green change, ethical enlightenment, societal improvement, better childcare and education, and are working towards this alongside women. Sometimes, for heavenrsquos sake, they are even taking the lead.Meanwhile, children in two-parent families are open to influences from both parents. While women still tend to spend more time with their young, this does not necessarily equate to a more lasting influence on their behaviour or outlook. The other day my husbandrsquos granddaughter rushed to interrupt her mother who was on the phone to announce that Liverpool had just scored a fourth goal against Newcastle ndash whose influence was that We are going through a phase where almost every interview with a woman politician or banker, entrepreneur or artist, includes the obligatory question about #MeToo, in the same way that every American is asked their opinion of Trump. And while it obviously takes women at the top to help bring about change for those lower down the ladder ndash or in the community at large ndash it is surely not a sacred obligation placed upon each of them. To assume that is to be sexist and discriminatory. Itrsquos certainly not an expectation placed upon men.Yet to listen to some womenrsquos outrage, yoursquod think therersquos a contract, signed at birth, that insists women pay especial attention to female issues eventhere are things that interest them more. Florence Nightingale and Elsie Inglis personally helped save hundreds of lives, and their influence rippled down the decades to the benefit of all, women as much as men. Yet their initial impulse was not to improve things for their own kind, but to help wounded soldiers and the sick and dying. In other words, to improve the conditions of humanity as a whole, not one gender or the other.Of course splinter groups and special interest parties can make things change ndash just look at Dr Inglisrsquos formidable all-women hospitals. There is a galvanising power and collective spirit in female solidarity that nobody can deny. So letrsquos hear it for women tackling climate change. And for men too.In these unsettling and perilous times we surely need to remember that we are all just people. Our identity is not primarily male or female, trans, intersex, other, or whatever label fits. We are simply and essentially human, with all the complexities of personality, type, and biases that entails. Since wersquore in it all together, thatrsquos also how we should sort things out."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9245391.jpg?type=article-full","title":"burnin-the-clavie-alistair-heather-in-scots-on-a-tradition-thats-aulder-than-scotland","story":"The Clavie is the flamin Archangel Tar half-barrel that gets cairtit roon Burgheid ilka auld new year, the th o Janurary.

He is talking about the purchase by gangsters of real-world business which employ real people and do real business in Scotland.And he believes the consequences for failing to deal with this criminalisation could be grave.

Was the show considered a lucky charm \"I dont know about a lucky charm, but it is a rite of passage,\" says Norton. \"There is a very elite club of people who have played dead bodies on Taggart. They probably meet up once a year.\"There has been talk about a Taggart reboot led by Andrew Macdonald, who produced Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, Sunshine on Leith,  Days Later and The Last King of Scotland. Im curious whether Norton has been approached to join that.\"I dont think I would be involved,\" he asserts. \"My character would be far too old to be in the police force ndash he would be well retired by now. I doubt I would be back in it. Althoughthey asked me, I would certainly give it serious consideration.\"If they do it then it would be good to have a fresh team in there. The first rumour I heard ndash and it is only whispers ndash is that they would have Taggarts daughter heading the team because in the original series he did have a daughter who was very young.\"She would be the right age now,she had gone into the police force, to head the murder squad. Personally I think it would be a great idea to have a woman lead the team and to also have someone called Taggart which would make sense with the title.\"Norton lives in London with his we Sally. The couple have three grown-up sons: Jamie, , has a degree in sound design and plans to go into video game design Rory, , is teaching English in Japan and Jock, , is in a band called Puppy who are due to release their debut album this month.The actor admits that, while he doesnt get back to his native Glasgow as often as he would like, he still considers it home. \"I always think of it as being like an umbilical cord,\" he says. \"It doesnt matter where I am in the world, I am always drawn back to Glasgow.\"Norton grew up in the Gorbals and then Pollokshaws on the south side of the city where his family moved when he was seven. \"What is now Pollok Country Park was five minutes from my door,\" he says. \"That was almost like my back garden where me and my pals would play.\"Although our house was just a wee room and kitchen, it was anything but a slum background. There was open air, freedom and joy.\"Nortons upbringing was not without its share of adversity. He was only  when his mother Sarah died from kidney failure. She was just . Norton believes her death was linked to her consumption of once-popular headache remedy Askit Powders.The over-the-counter painkiller, which is no longer available, was produced in Glasgow and mainly marketed to women. Askit Powders contained aspirin, caffeine and ndash until  ndash phenacetin, which was later linked with kidney damage.Norton is trying to secure backing for a documentary on the subject. As a child, he remembers his mother taking the powders ndash known for its catchy advertising tagline \"Askit fights the miseries\" ndash often several times a day.He describes it as an \"epidemic\" that affected mainly working-class women. \"By , they were producing  million packets a year just for distribution in the west of Scotland,\" he says. \"It is one of these things that has been quietly forgotten. Nobody was brought to book.\"Norton first became aware of the link between Askit and kidney failure after watching a documentary some years after the death of his mother. It has always stayed with him and in the decades that followed he has often thought about pursuing the idea of a documentary.\"Most people in a similar situation who had lost a parent ndash usually their mother ndash like me didnt put two and two together either and realise it was connected to Askit. It was seen as being mothers little helper. Families were torn apart by it.\"His motivation, says Norton, is to tell the stories of those who were affected. \"There cant be a legal recourse ndash the Askit Powders company doesnt exist anymore,\" he says.The fire was reignited as Norton toured after publishing his autobiography, Theres Been a Le, in . \"This lady came up to me at a book signing and said she was very friendly with an heir to the Askit fortune, because I had mentioned it in the book,\" he says.\"I thought, Christ, there are people living high on the hog off the profits of this pernicious bloody thing. Do they realise the cost that funded their lestyle and left them with a legacy  Do they realise what my legacy was  Or the legacy of hundreds of other families in Scotland \"There is little doubt about the deep impact it had on his formative teenage years. After Nortons mother died, it left only him, his father John and younger brother Dougie in the family home.\"It was hard enough for me,\" he says. \"But my brother was only five and had the tragedy of growing up without a loving mother. My mums sister and my granny did most of the rearing of him. I left home at . I just had to go. I went to London.\"It was terribly hard for my dad as well. But there was that Glasgow thing where it was never discussed. Afterwards no one talked about it. You were just expected to get on with your le. That, for me, was a problem ndash although I didnt figure that at the time,\" he continues.\"I have since looked into it and learnedyou dont have that grieving process, particularly when you are young, it can come out later as depression. And that is exactly what happened to me.\"When I was in my early twenties, I got terrible depression. I had no idea what caused it. You just think, Why am I feeling like this  It never occurred to me that it was to do with the fact that I hadnt properly grieved my mothers passing.\"An amateur pop psychologist might suggest this was why he pursued a le as an actor. Did the escapism appeal  Norton acknowledges that it was certainly a factor. \"I knew I didnt want to be part of the le that was being pencilled in for me,\" he says.His father aspired for his son to become a plumber. \"A great trade and there are times I have thought that I wished I had listened to my dad and had become a plumber,\" says Norton.\"But I did want to get out of my background. I wanted to be more. And part of a bigger world. It is the old cliche about the working class that there is only three ways out: sport, showbusiness or crime. I wasnt very sporty and didnt fancy a le of crime, so showbiz was the only option.\"Norton has worked steadily for more than half a century in theatre, film and television . Another early job saw him play guitar with the late David Bowie in the  movie The Virgin Soldiers.\"It was before he was famous,\" he says. \"We were in this film together as basically gloried extras. We were like the guys in Dads Army, the ones who stand at the back of the squad.\"There were three weeks of night shoots. We were in Bury St Edmunds, it was November and freezing. It was meant to be the bloody Malaysian jungle in the height of sweltering summer and so we were wearing thin shorts and cotton Army shirts.\"Davy and I found out we both played guitar and would bring our guitars onto the set. It was meant to be a train wreck after an ambush and in the breaks between set-ups we would spend our time huddled in a railway carriage trying to keep warm. We would sing and play guitar.\"I didnt realise then that he was going to be one of the biggest stars in the world,\" adds Norton. \"But I thought he was extraordinary. It was like: Wow. When he started singing, it was fantastic. I remember thinking, Why is this guy bothering to be a gloried extra \"I didnt say it to him, of course. I cant say that I said, David, you should be in the music business hellip and that he replied, Yes, you are right, Alex. I will do that hellip\" Norton breaks off laughing. \"That never happened. But I realised he was something special.\"As well as traditional acting roles, Norton has carved a niche in the video game market. \"When my kids were growing up, they played a lot of video games. I used to watch them and realised that it was a real emerging market. I thought, This is the future.\"With a video game you [as the player] are the star of it and go through the adventure. I am doing quite a lot of video game voices. I have become a wee bit of a star in the video game world.\"Norton says his son Rory, while teaching English in Japan, earned major kudos points with a class of teenagers after he revealed that his father had voiced the character Rab in the hugely popular Dragon Quest franchise. \"He called me afterwards and said, They went completely apes***.\"I love doing video games.

Robson, who starred in the Bafta Scotland-winning short My Loneliness is Killing Me, is fast carving a reputation for pushing himself to the limits physically and mentally as he strives to bring an extra dimension to the characters he plays.This has seen him iously add an inch to his collar size, place stones in his shoes, go into self-imposed isolation during filming and use duct tape to \"mody\" his silhouette.Robson deliberately suffered sleep deprivation for a role in the forthcoming film Spin State in which he plays a private detective plagued by mysterious blackouts.\"The character is an amnesiac, so he has problems remembering his past and lots of psychological turmoil,\" he says. \"The script, written by the director Ross A Wilson, was a very personal one and cathartic for him. It was symbolic of things from his own personal le.\"I felt a great responsibility and pressure in playing that role because I wanted to convey something visceral and real.

Proof that gingers rule the world.Fiona Erskine, authorMEET Dr Jaqueline Silver. She blows things up to keep people safe. The intrepid scientist, international jet-setter and explosives expert is at the heart of a debut thriller from real-le chemical engineer Fiona Erskine.The Edinburgh-born author has written The Chemical Detective, which opens with Silver working on avalanche control in Slovenia when she discovers an irregularity in a consignment of explosives.After filing a complaint with the multinational chemical company that supplied them, Silver finds herself threatened, narrowly escapes death and is framed for murder.Escaping from police custody, she sets out to discover the truth, racing between the snow-covered slopes of Slovenia and the haunting ruins of Chernobyl.The Chemical Detective is set to be the first in a series. Here Erskine, , talks about the inspiration behind the opening novel.You began writing after a skiing accident. What happened I was in Meribel in France and it was my first ever attempt at skiing. I only managed one day before I had the accident.I wasnt the best skier in the world, fell over, my ski boot didnt disengage and my knee just went. My ACL [anterior cruciate ligament] snapped. It was surprisingly painful.They had to send someone on a sledge to ski me down. That was exciting because they gave me a shot of morphine and the guy who skied me down was one of the most handsome men I have ever seen. Once the painkillers started to wear off, I realised it wasnt such a great end to the day.I was on holiday with my husband and our two sons. Because I had to get a special flight back, they had a bit of extra holiday time while we waited. I would sit in the bar while they were off skiing.How did the idea for your book come about I took strong painkillers and gazed out at the slopes through the panoramic windows of a hotel bar. My daytime companions were Russian men who started drinking at breakfast.French painkillers and Russian baddies was a pretty brilliant combination. That is how I had the idea for Dr Jaqueline Silver. She just came all by herself. I think it was partly just to have an alter ego who could ski. She is brilliant at skiing.Each of the books I have written ndash and there are four ndash is focused on an industrial accident. Theres Bhopal in India, Chernobyl in Ukraine, Banqiao Dam in China and an oil accident in Brazil.That is my starting point because I have always been really interested in industrial safety elements. I guess that is almost the motivation: I want to explain it to people and bring it to le.The Chemical Detective is set between Slovenia and Ukraine. Why did you choose those locations I had been to Slovenia with my family because we do a lot of outdoor swimming. We went in the summer, but I thought what a great place to set the skiing in.Logistically, because I needed to have lots of lorry movements through eastern Europe for the plot, France was just too far away. Where the book opens in Kranjskabel is a mix of Kranjska Gora in Slovenia and Meribel in France.I recently went to Chernobyl for the first time. I had done a lot of research, so I knew enough to write about it, but it was valuable to see it properly. I did a one-day tour. It is more beautul than you might expect.What was interesting was looking at how horrible the planned Soviet technology cities were. They were so lacking in imagination. The first people to arrive lived in Apartment Block , their children went to School  and they could use Shop  and Cafe .The first time I went to Kiev was in  on a school trip. I remember how very rigid everything was and lacking in curves and softness. Planned is good but it was very brutal.It was very interesting to see how, as nature has taken over at Chernobyl, how much softer and nuanced and beautul it is when you visit. I was surprised by how lovely it was.Was there a danger element visiting Chernobyl Not really. I had done my research thoroughly and hired a Geiger counter which I took everywhere with me. It would get slightly higher in places but walking down a street of granite in Aberdeen you would probably get something similar.Inside the actual sarcophagus, obviously there is extreme radiation there. There is a lot of buried stuff soyou went poking around with a spade you could probably be in danger.Sum up Dr Jaqueline Silver in a few words Athletic. Feisty. Voracious sexual appetite. Clever.

Itrsquos amazing to think that his greatest invention was perfected in Borsquoness, and that the building in which he did so can still be seen, adjacent to Kinneil House. Hopefully, our efforts will make people more aware of this great Scot and his amazing contributions that changed the world.The cottage, the only surviving building in Scotland directly linked to Wattrsquos pioneering work, was specically built to allow Watt to test his steam power theories well away from the prying eyes of industrial spies desperate for a glimpse of what he was up to.He had been struck by an idea for a dramatically improved kind of steam engine while repairing a Newcomen steam engine and realising how much energy was wasted by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder.He realised a separate chamber to condense the steam could boost power and be far more fuel efficient. However, his hopes of testing his theory with working models were hampered by a shortage of funds and lack of space in his Glasgow workshop.Industrialist Dr John Roebuck, owner of the Carron Iron Works in Falkirk, stepped in to offer Watt funds to work on and patent his revolutionary steam condenser design in exchange for a share of the profits from the patent.Roebuckrsquos Carron Iron Works ndash which itself played a key role in the industrial revolution producing carronade canons for the Duke of Wellington, kitchen ranges, pillar boxes and bath tubs ndash provided a source of iron and workmanship for Wattrsquos prototypes, while his Kinneil estate offered privacy and access to the nearby Gil Burn to help power a full-size test engine.In a letter to Roebuck, Watt wrote: ldquoOn considering the engine to be erected with you, I think the best place will be to erect a small house in the glen behind Kinneil.ldquoThe burn will afford us plenty of cold water, and we will be more free from speculation than we can be about Borsquoness.While his patent was lodged on January , , his tests were hindered as Carron Iron Worksrsquo workers struggled to create Wattrsquos exact requirements for workable components.It wasnrsquot until  and with Roebuck bankrupt, that Birmingham industrialist Matthew Boulton stepped in to provide finance and links to experienced mechanics who could help create his vision.Apart from a large cast iron engine cylinder which remains at the Kinneil site, Wattrsquos equipment was dismantled and moved to Boultonrsquos iron foundry in Birmingham. Within a year Wattrsquos first large steam engines were providing the power needed to drive forward mills and factories, and the industrial revolution was fully under way.Wattrsquos workshop cottage went on to become a laundry house and eventually fell into disrepair. Today all that marks its unique role in the industrial revolution is a small information .Ian Shearer, chairman of Friends of Kinneil, said: ldquoThe whole site should be an important visitor attraction. In many ways James Wattrsquos Cottage at Kinneil was the crucible of the engineering revolution that spread across the UK and across the world. The cottage stands directly on the line of the Roman Antonine Wall which runs through Kinneil Estate, and is where most of Wattrsquos development work took place.Professor Colin McInnes, James Watt Chair, Professor of Engineering Science at the University of Glasgow, said: ldquoJames Wattrsquos contribution to engineering cannot be understated, key to which was the step change in efficiency he delivered through the separate steam condenser.ldquoHis initial is stamped on every light bulb, measuring the electrical power it delivers, but also reminding us of the sheer intellectual light he brought to the world."},{"url":null,"title":"radar-poised-to-revolutionise-the-way-we-live-at-home","story":"With experiments taking place just before the outbreak of the Second World War, radarrsquos object-locating abilities were ideally placed to scoop up funding from governments around the world as they prepared for conflict.For the first time, radio waves could be transmitted, bounced off far-away objects and detected again, allowing boats and aircraft to work out where other vessels were located.Spinning radar sensors were placed on warships and air traffic control towers and now, more than  years later, the technology has been adapted and miniaturised, with incredible results.Following major breakthroughs in hardware, researchers from the University of St Andrews think that it might soon be used to boil the kettle ndash using only your coffee cup.A human and computer interactions research group from the university worked on a Google-backed developer programme to explore how radar might be incorporated into our daily lives by placing transmitters in our phones, televisions and kitchen appliances.While early radar was used for large-object location, such as detecting enemy warships, Professor Andrew Quigley says that the latest technology can fit a radar receiver and transmitter on to a tiny microchip.He said: ldquoWhat really opened it up is this notion that the receiving antenna and the transmitting antenna are all fabricated on to the same surface. Itrsquos printed on to a very small chip, about the size of your fingernail.ldquoIf you go back to the radar that was used during the war, the installations were massive.ldquoAndyou go back to the decades after that, the size of radar was for very large-scale, long-distance detection of very small objects very far away.Using miniaturised radar sensors built into the devices we use every day, Mr Quigley says that we could control devices without even touching them.He says that instead of using your hand to gesture and control something, people will actually use objects to control computers and revolutionise everyday living.For example, this could mean building a kettle activated by a normal coffee cup, or a casino table that can distinguish between the cards and monitor a game of poker for cheating.Mr Quigley said: ldquoDesigners and developers can imagine looking at a kettle and saying, lsquoOh, therersquos a physical button there. But therersquos a unit that I have to actually put into the kettle to have a physical button, and I could replace all of that with a radar chiprsquo.ldquoYou could gesture at it, but you could also use an object.ldquoIf you put your cup near your kettle, and itrsquos your coffee cup, the kettle knows to boil the water in a particular way. Oryou put a dferent cup there, it knows you will have tea, so it could it boil it in a dferent way.ldquoYou could put these sensors into a casino, and then the entire casino experience could become digitised, Mr Quigley said.ldquoThe cards, the chips, the dice, the dominoes: whatever elements you have.The group has already been approached by companies that think radar sensors could monitor what shoppers buy as they travel around the store, eliminating the need for a checkout.ldquoWhile the possibilities of the new technology seem endless, the project began with just a small andcompetitive developer programme run by Google.The team at St Andrews were the only developers in the UK to gain access to the programme, and used their paper to explore the way that radar sensors can recognise physical objects in the home or workplace.In a video published by the team, they demonstrate a radar sensor counting playing cards, measuring the angle of a mobile phone and simulating a card game.On Tuesday, Google received approval from US regulators to put their Project Soli sensors into mobile phones.The Federal Communications Commission ruling said the radar chips ldquowill serve the public interest by providing for innovative device control features using touchless hand gesture technology and could help disabled users.Alongside the object-activated system developed by the St Andrews team,Google says that radar chips would allow users to press imaginary buttons or turn virtual dials to operate its devices, or operate screens by waving your hand, similar to the technology featured in the film Minority Report.For Mr Quigley and his team, use of radar might change the way we use our devices forever.ldquoWersquoll look back on today in  or  yearsrsquo time, and it will look quaint, he said.ldquoWersquore stuck on a plateau right now. If there is no keyboard then people just freak out. If thatrsquos the way you understand how to talk to a computer then of course thatrsquos how yoursquore going to talk to it.ldquoButyour cup can be all you need to interact with a computer in the morning then you donrsquot need a keyboard."},{"url":null,"title":"racism-against-teachers-in-scottish-schools-not-being-reported","story":"Ken Muir, chief executive of the body, has now called on headteachers, teachers and council officials to urgently improve reporting procedures.Earlier this year, a major report on the lack of teachers from black and ethnic minoritybackgrounds - called Teaching in a Diverse Scotland - highlighted shocking incidents of casual racism in schools.In one example a white teacher who was mentoring a talented ethnic minority teaching student complained to her university that she smelled of curry.In another case a teacher at a secondary school with pupils from Pakistan, India and Syria was overheard saying: \"I think I am coming into a refugee camp\".Recent figures show just two per cent of teachers are from BME backgrounds despite making up four per cent of the Scottish population. The figures are even lower for headteachers and deputy heads with . per cent of the total from BME backgrounds.Mr Muir said: \"In the past five years there has been one referral relating to racism and that didnrsquot even occur in a school. It involved the removal of a teacher from the register for racially abusing a nightclub bouncer on a Saturday night.\"The mismatch between what black and minority ethnic probationers and teachers say and the reporting of racist incidents to local authorities and the GTCS is all too apparent.\"Mr Muir said signicant under-reporting of racist incidents was caused by a number of factors - including the fear of dealing with a potentially legal matter and the wider impact of a lack of action when incidents were reported.And he said the Teaching in a Diverse Scotland report had uncovered unacceptable examples where black and minority ethnic students, probationers and teachers were being treated dferently.\"There were BME students who were made to feel unwelcome on placements, probationers who received little or no support which contrasted with that received by other white probationers and BME teachers who had left or planned to leave teaching because they had been unsuccessful too many times in gaining promotion, citing the colour of their skin as the only plausible reason,\" he added.A spokeswoman for the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union backed the GTCS concerns about under-reporting.She said: \"Our recent survey of BME members found that nearly three-quarters had experienced racism in their capacity as a teacher or lecturer.\"Reduced access to workplace opportunities was also a strong theme and nearly half of respondents had experienced being overlooked for promotion while a quarter had been bullied or harassed at work on the grounds of race or religion.\"Urgent efforts are needed to challenge workplace racism and to develop, in all establishments, comprehensive anti-racist policies which translate into real actions.\"A key recommendation from the report, written by a working group chaired by Professor Rowena Arshad, Head of Education at Edinburgh University,is that the number of BME teachers in Scotlandrsquos schools should be at least four per cent by .Ms Arshad, co-director of the Centre for Education for Racial Equality in Scotland, said schools could no longer shy away from addressing \"racism, racial discrimination or harassment\".She said: \"The lack of ersity in the teaching workforce has been a persistent and long-term issue. This lack of ersity is becoming increasingly pressing and visible, as the pupil population in Scottish schools is getting more erse.\"Her report said: \"Despite the issues ... workplace racism was rarely recognised or raised by local authorities. Some respondents indicated they have never managed a race-focused complaint as part of their role and therefore lack the knowledge or experience of recognising race related matters.\"Given that we know issues exist, it is surprising and disappointing to note that in some cases employer awareness of issues appears to be very low.\"In , the GTCS struck off a teacher who shouted racist abuse at a black nightclub bouncer. Rachael Patterson, , called the steward a \"monkey\" and made monkey noises at him. Patterson was sacked and convicted of racially aggravated conduct."},{"url":null,"title":"vince-cable-urges-theresa-may-to-end-brinkmanship-over-security-in-n-ireland","story":"The call from Sir Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, came as the issue of the Irish border and the row over the backstop ndash the guarantee that the border would remain open ndash continued to be the impasse to securing the UK-EU deal on Brexit.Police officers, north and south of the border, are due to begin training this month after Police Service of Northern Ireland[PSNI] chiefs requested reinforcements to deal with any trouble that might arise from reviving a hard border.But Sir Vince called on Theresa May to take a no-deal scenario off the table to avoid anyof such a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.ldquoThe Brexiteers claims that the security of Northern Ireland is not at risk as a result of Brexit have been further dismantled by these reports.

The David Bowie Alumni Tour: A Bowie Celebration will arrive in Glasgow on January th at the cityrsquos  Academy.Among them Mike Garson, Bowiersquos veteran pianist, lead-guitarist Earl Slick who delivered ldquofat licks on the likes Golden Years, and Mark Plati another long-serving producer and multi-instrumentalist who began working with Bowie in the mid s.Garson, who was originally hired for only eight weeks in , brought his definitive avant-garde flourishes to Aladdin Sane the following year. ldquoI have great memories of people flying off the balcony at Greenrsquos Playhouse in January . Glasgow was always a wild place to play where the fans had a deep love of the music so wersquore looking forward to playing there.\"With Glastonbury  coming out wersquove been looking at that set. It was a triumphant evening and of the thousands of shows I did with David that would be in the top three along with the Hammersmith Odeon in  and Isle of Wight Festival . The band sounded amazing that night, we looked out at the audience of , and walking onstage David turns and asks me to warm them up with Greensleeves.\"I almost had a heart-attack when he started with Wild Is The Wind ndash it showed he was unafraid to try anything he wanted that night, he sang and played everything so well. When I heard it was coming out while I was touring with these musicians I was very excited.The new century saw Bowie shake-off the experimental zeal of the mid s while embracing hits from his back catalogue. Mark Plati points to the signicance of Earl Slick ing to the fold after a -year hiatus. ldquoSlick was perfect musically, personally and everything . He fitted in like he had just stopped playing the week before, we plugged him in and he was there.\"For the set we played a lot of the material that Slick was involved with, we brought in Station to Station, Stay, Golden Years and Wild Is The Wind and he was the perfect call for those songs. I would stand in the middle of this triangle between David Bowie, Earl Slick and Mike Garson ndash little old me who grew up listening to these guys and the three of them are looking at me to start the song. I would have to kick myself and say lsquoshut up and do your jobrsquo. That was incredible on every level because everyone involved was in such a good place, it was a wonderful period and one of the great performances of Davidrsquos later career.Face to face after a sweaty performance at Liverpoolrsquos Cavern Club, Earl Slick is every inch the rock guitar hero with raven-black spiky hair, tattoos and long scarves. Behind sunglasses while smoking a cigarette in a long black winterrsquos coat the New Yorker recalls his first encounter with Bowie. ldquoAn audition was arranged at RCA studios, they set up in the main room and asked me to play while they mixed Diamond Dogs. Then there was dead silence which made me think this might not be good.\"David then walked in and sat down, we had a drink, a snort [of cocaine] and started noodling a couple of guitars. They said theyrsquod let me know in a couple of weeks. I had a call the next day to meet David at his hotel and that was it.Slick would play a vital role on Bowiersquos  album Station to Station, where a ldquosnort and a drink were constant during the sessions while recording at Hollywoodrsquos lauded Cherokee Studios. The black soul of previous long-player Young Americanswas fused with experimental Krautrock and the repetitive, robotic rhythms developed by Germanyrsquos electronic music pioneers. Bowiersquos Thin White Duke personae, a cold, baleful European figure informed by the occult, Jewish mysticism and a fascination with the Third Reich was as potent a creation as Ziggy Stardust. Describing the album as ldquoa wayward spiritual search Bowie also drew on The Stations of the Cross and the lost, alcoholic alien he played in Nicolas Roegrsquos The Man Who Fell To Earth.ldquoDavid absorbed a lot of everything, he was interested in history and social issues and it all went in, says Slick. ldquoStation to Station came up out of nowhere, I had a call from him out the blue in LA and we began recording in a small rehearsal space for two days at the studio to touch on the vibe for the record which was not complete by any means.\"A lot of the lyrics were unfinished and the title trackwas three dferent parts of dferent songs that we glued together. The wail of feedback on the guitar was a spur of the moment thing at am in the morning, we were up all night recording as usual. Thatrsquos both of us with a wall of Marshall stacks itrsquos not just me.Bowie worked closely with the guitarist relying on him to conjure essential rfs, textures and licks for the likes of Golden Years. ldquoI have to say thank you to Eric [Clapton] for that one he admits. ldquoIt came from Creamrsquos Outside Woman Blues and there was a little of Funky Broadway by Wilson Pickett. David would say lsquowhatve you got rsquo Irsquod be like lsquogive me a minutersquo and come up with something on the spot that happened on Stay, it was built around the lick of John, Irsquom Only Dancing Again the chords and chorus are the same. On Diamond Dogs the majority of the guitar work is David, that wasnrsquot unusual because he could play a few instruments well enough to come up with what was required. He came up with the rf on Rebel Rebel,he couldnt play something well enough or to his liking Mick , myself or whoever would do it.Bowie toured Station To Station with replacement guitarist Stacy Heydon, who would later describe Slickrsquos work on the record as ldquoextraordinary.Slick finally took Station To Station on the road for an acclaimed th anniversary tour in  with Rolling Stones backing vocalist Bernard Fowler who will also join also him in Glasgow to perform cuts from the album.ldquoThat tour was put together with Davidrsquos blessing, he endorsed it adds Slick. ldquoOnce I got to the point of preparing for the tour I let him know Bernard was singing because the last thing I wanted was a Bowie clone, I knew I had the right guy.Garson suggests that he and Slick, who first performed together with Bowie in June , will also revisit the Diamond Dogs Tour that worked to cement Bowiersquos legend in America.ldquoWersquore looking at Sweet Thing Candidate which hasnrsquot been played live since that tour and other things from the period, wersquoll rehearse We Are The Dead from Diamond Dogs. Lady Grinning Soul was a song we never did live which we played on the Aladdin Sane tour last year, the reaction was thrilling, I was always waiting to do that one, I think it was one of Davidrsquos greatest.\"Of course wersquoll be doing more familiar songs like Le On Mars which I played maybe  times over the years and every time was dferent, I put my own stamp on it but stuck to the original vibe that Rick Wakeman brought to the track. The first time was on Davidrsquos first major American tour as Ziggyin September  and the last was in  at a benefit concert.

These voters of the Conservative and Unionist Party were willing to support Scottish independenceor to risk the collapse of the Northern Ireland peace processto safeguard their Brexit vision.There is real evidence here that, the more protracted the Brexit process becomes, the more entrenched many voters will become in their views, to the abandonment of traditional political outlooks and even rational thought. Brexit is clearly dislodging long-held red lines about what Mrs May described as \"our precious Union\" and, it would certainly appear that she is somewhat out of step with the party faithful on this, as well as other matters.The view of Brexit as a bloodless revolution wherein epic symbolism replaces the reality of demanding constitutional change seems to be inherent in the frustration that many Conservative Party members and voters feel about the Prime Ministers deal. Scapegoating the EU as the eternal source of Britains woes has long been a fall-back position of the far rightand it has now become mainstreamed to the extent that a no-deal Brexit is preferred to any common-sense judgment by many associated with the Conservative Party.As preparations for the fall-out of a no-deal Brexit continue apace, the uncertainty of Britains place in the world has never been so stark. For those who see the EU as a symbol of our lost empire and an economic subservience to the defeated powers of the Second World War, only a complete exit from Europes interference will suffice. The rest of us can only hope that logical, st century realpolitik can carry the day. Whatever the outcome, Britain will never be the same.Owen Kelly, Dunvegan Drive, Stirling.FOR EU citizens and their families living in the UK to have to pay pound to secure the rights they already have to stay here beggars belief .Putting aside the fact that there are not currently , EU citizens in Scotland, but in fact . million EU citizens, it is clearly deeply insulting to ask those who make such a major contribution to our economy and society to pay pound for the apparent ongoing privilege.Adding insult to injury, it should be remembered that this is also a group of iniduals who were not even given the opportunity to vote in the EU referendum and decide the future of the country in which they live.What we continue to forget is the value of EU citizens to the UK economy. Those from the EU living in the UK contribute substantially more than they cost, adding to exchequer coffers and easing the tax burden on other taxpayers. Those from the EU contribute pound, more each per year in net terms than the average UK adult to the exchequer. Over their letime they pay in pound, more than they take out in public services and benefits, while the UK citizenrsquos net average contribution is zero.This is because most of those from the EU arrive fully educated, and many leave before the costs of retirement start to weigh on the public finances. Taxes will therefore inevitably have to risewe bring in curbs on those from the EU.If we want to insult and chase away those who are not only our relatives, friends and colleagues, but who make such a major economic contribution, the UK Government is going exactly the right way about it.Alex Orr,Flat ,  Marchmont Road, Edinburgh.ON opening this morningrsquos Herald I was not in the least surprised at the stance taken by the first two correspondents, Dr Gerald Edwards and Keith Howell .They assert three things, Nicola Sturgeonrsquos anti-Brexit stance, her demand for a Scottish independence referendum, and a general raft of criticism about the SNP Government.As far as Brexit is concerned, Scotland voted against Brexit  per cent to  per cent in the referendum, and is now moving into the  per cent area according to opinion polls, so any action to oppose it is in accordance with the wishes of the Scottish people ndash and increasingly with the rUK.Nicola Sturgeon is not tub-thumping about a referendum, but is waiting until the dust settles. As far as the criticism of education, transport and the NHS is concerned the SNP Government is attempting to deal with the problems ndash and these problems are far worse south of the Border.Now consider the case for the Union: its attempt to leave the EU but retain what it sees are essentials are doomed to failure, but the Leavers are trying to portray themselves as victims. The chaotic scenes at Westminster and the wriggling about by the Unionists, both Theresa May and the indecisive Jeremy Corbyn are spectacular failures, but Scotland has to suffer for their incompetence.The UKs Department of Transport has given a contract for additional ferries to cope with the demand after Brexit to a company which has never run any ships, does not own any ships ndash and has no sailors.

who lives in Thurso, has been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Years Honours List in recognition of his services to the community in Caithness. He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action.

Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

They also improved the character of residential areas and the quality of le for residents, he added.Councillor Andrew Sinclair, Wick and East Caithness, admitted to being a bit sceptical when he first heard about the proposal. ldquoIt sounded like change for the sake of change. Whilst I have slightly warmed to the idea, I still have some concerns, he said.Councillor Sinclair thinks the vast majority of vehicles are already driving at around mph through Wick anyway.He wonders how effectively the new speed limits will be implemented with all the current pressures and priorities of the police.The scheme is being rolled out across the region with restrictions implemented for Alness, Dingwall, Invergordon and Tain. Gateway signage, roundels, mph repeater signs and speed indication devices have been introduced in all four Ross-shire towns.Some local residents commenting on social media felt it would be hard to police the speed restriction effectively.Wick man Konrad Szewczyk said: ldquoSuch nannying should be relegated to nurseries and primary schools, not entire settlements.\"A Bridge Street shopkeeper, Kevin Milkins, thought there was \"little use having laws with no-one to enforce them\", referring to a lack of policing.While one local woman who did not wish to be named said: \"They can set whatever speed limits they want but the idiots and young racers will decide their own speed.\"A council spokesperson said thatthe scheme goes through the consultation process with no objections it could be in place by March.Saturday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118636.jpg","title":"New chief is told of local issues","story":"BUDGET cuts and decentralisation were the main topics raised by Caithness people when the new Highland Council chief executive, Donna Manson, visited Wick and Thurso.She met staff, councillors and members of the public as she listened to their concerns and issues.

The issue was highlighted in the Courier of November  and Highland Council made aware of the most recent spate of vandalism in which first-floor windows were broken.A former janitor had confronted boys throwing stones at the windows and had previously alerted police when he saw people walking about on the roof of the former technical department.Speaking about her efforts to make the building safe, Councillor Sinclair said: \"I first asked for this work to be done several months ago but officers in every department are very stretched both for time and money, so I am pleased that the work has finally been completed and thank the people involved, both council and contractor.\"However, she stressed that it was only a \"small step forward\" and that it should \"not take elected members months of asking to have this small amount of work done\".She said: \"The council as a whole needs to consider whether it has become so bureaucratic and centralised that it effectively disempowers its own members. I hope our new chief executive will take radical steps to shake things up and deliver the localism we have been promised.\"She went on to say how she is now considering a motion to the council that commits it to having a better-planned exit strategy for its estates. \"Too many town centres are falling into a state of terrible decline,\" Councillor Sinclair said. \"Often that is to do with market forces and therefore beyond our control, but when its council land contributing to that decline we have a responsibility to address it.\"A council spokesperson said: \"The property was boarded up to try and prevent further vandalism.\"Initially we boarded up all the ground-floor windows and doors on all the buildings.

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue. The move from loan schemes to direct payments and other schemes meeting set payment deadlines will build trust within the sector in the post-Brexit era and aid the organisation and planning of farm businesses in uncertain times.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They’re all numbers, my lot. I’m a complete anomaly. I’m a words person.”Shakespeare, poetry, Ted Talks, and over the phone too she’s a wizard wordsmith, but ask her about insider trading, stocks and shares and hedge funds and she’s stymied. No matter because what she CAN do is act, and it all adds up in her latest role in ITV’s Cleaning Up, in which she stars opposite Sheridan Smith as a pair of down-on-their-luck cleaners who find an ingenious,illegal, way of playing the system. The result is a darkly amusing tale of have-nots at the bottom of the social pile fighting back, using the same methods as the have-it-alls they clean up after in Canary Wharf, a tale about modern Britain with zero hours contracts and with strong female leads. Cleaning Up, written by newcomer Mark Marlow, and directed by Lewis Arnold Humans, Broadchurch, Misfits, Banana centres on the friendship between Anouka’s character Jess and Sam, played by Sheridan Smith. The actors hit it off at the audition, lending an ease and authenticity to their performances.“Sam and Jess have grown up together and Jess is the voice of reason, someone who thinks before she does, which Sam doesn’t, so they’re a good match. Jess tries to keep her out of trouble.”It’s not easy to stay out of trouble when you’re hard up and the pair are tempted to take a gamble, much like the financiers in the shiny offices the invisible army cleans overnight. “It’s about who deserves to get away with stuff,” says Anouka. “Being the underdog you feel you’ve got to look out for yourself andyou’re living hand to mouth, one mistake has massive repercussions. Seeing people get away with it, you’d feel like, ‘why shouldn’t I ’” “It puts the spotlight on the everyday people, the ones working hard to pay their bills, not living the high le, which is most of the country. It’s good to see people like that fighting back.”“I think a lot of people will just love Cleaning Up. When I watched it I was thinking about all the people I know and thinking ‘my dad will love this’ and that it really is one of those shows you will sit down and watch with your family, it’s brilliant.”Anouka is no stranger to cleaning up from when she worked in pubs and cafes to supplement her acting income, starting out. Last year was the first she’s made a living through acting alone.“When I was starting out there were times when I had three jobs. If I wasn’t auditioning or learning lines I was always working. I would wake up and go shoe shining, then in the afternoon work in a pub or cafe, then in the evening in a call centre, so it’s quite full on. There’s no chill time. That’s what you see in Cleaning Up, that these characters are always working and never get to relax.”Surprisingly, the bar work or call centre jobs are not the ones that come to mind when Anouka recalls her worst ever job.“Oh God, I was a children’s entertainer when I was at drama school,” she says, still scarred. “I did parties and face painting and that was fine, but it was before I had satnav on my phone and I’d get completely lost trying to find the houses so I’d be late. And I’d look ridiculous, in a yellow car carrying a red suitcase wearing green dungarees or a tutu and having to run into petrol stations to ask directions. Then turning up in tears because I was late and ruining their day.” The children’s “No, the parents, oh my god. The children don’t care, they don’t know you’re late. They were all fine. But the parents were so stressed, and I just wanted to burst into tears but you can’t come in dressed as a clown and cry. It was so stressful I had to stop.” Anouka has been making a name for herself on stage and screen, with the airing of last year’s psychological thriller Trauma, for ITV, with John Simm and Adrian Lester and The Donmar Warehouse’s All-Female Shakespeare Trilogy in , as well as cult hit Chewing Gum in .This last year has been busy for the  Screen International Star of Tomorrow, working on three productions, two theatre and one film. She took the lead as Queen Margaret at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester, a composite of Shakespeare’s lines for Margaret of Anjou, a character he gave more words than any other, including Cleopatra and Rosalind, across four history plays. This production saw Anouka reassert Margaret as warrior queen, cutting a swathe through patriarchal power struggles in a re-telling of the Wars of the Roses, and at the same time waging a contemporary war on the historic gender imbalance in Shakespeare performance. Earlier last year she went forward in time to a dystopian world where blood quality can decide your credit rating in The Phlebotomist, and as well as Cleaning Up, she made the film, Fisherman’s Friends. Starring Tuppence Middleton and James Purefoy, it’s a feelgood tale of Cornish fisherman who land a record deal singing sea shanties, due out in March. She’s a familiar face north of the Border too, having won a Fringe First for her one-woman show Chef at the Traverse in  and the film of Donmar Warehouse’s Julius Caesar was up for best feature at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. “Incredible,” says Anouka, “considering it’s a live theatre recording. But Phyllida [Lloyd, the director], is also a film director so she knows what she’s doing. It’s quite special.”Born and raised in Greater London, Anouka is the middle of three children to a Jamaican father and Trinidadian mother. An athlete, she ran for Kent but got the acting bug at school and won a scholarship to the National Youth Theatre while at sixth form college in Lewisham.“Everyone there was going ‘yeah, I’m gonna be an actor, I’m going to drama school’ and I was ‘going to drama school  What’s going on ‘ere ’ Then after that I was like, “Oh, OK, I’m going to do this, it isn’t just a hobby, this is what I want to do.’” Guildford School of Acting followed and from there to the RSC, making her debut in  in Margaret Atwood’s Penelopiad. More theatre followed then TV with parts in Lucky Man and Doctor Who, before she landed the role in Trauma, ITV’S follow up to Doctor Foster, requiring her to learn how to rock climb. On stage, the Donmar Warehouse set her star rising too. Set in a women’s prison, the Trilogy of Julius Caesar, Henry IV and The Tempest, prompted Lloyd to hire an all-female ensemble cast of all ethnicities and ages to re-invigorate the Bard. Within a decade from first working in theatre Anouka was playing traditional male leads Hotspur, Ariel and Marc Anthony delivering the “Friends, Romans, countrymen…” speech.“It’s funny because I never liked Shakespeare when I was younger,” she says. ”But when I left drama school I got an interview with the RSC, ended up being there for two years and fell in love with it. And Shakespeare was where people started doing colour-blind casting. Everyone does Shakespeare at some point in this country and we need to look at why those plays should still be done, why they are relevant. So many seem quite modern in their themes – in a scary way I guess it’s history repeating itself.”She might be a words woman but Anouka likes a piece of the action too, and she played Hotspur as a kickboxer, preparing for the part by studying videos of Olympic boxing champion Nicola Adams, and training hard. “I grew up watching boxing with my dad, but they were big heavyweight guys, so I watched Nicola Adams, hours and hours of videos, how she trained. She even copied the Muhammad Ali shuffle. It was great fun, a great way to keep fit and I’d like to do it again. But I never sparred, not that, no-one’s coming near my face!” She laughs.Anouka writes and performs her own poetry, some of it published in her collection Eggs on Toast, and admits to sometimes finding it easier to express herself through poetry than through acting. She would love to combine theatre and poetry, her two loves, into a lyrical theatre piece, at the same time as popularising poetry by making it ‘less stuffy’. “With acting I find it often much harder to express what you want to say because you have less control over what’s going on. I started writing poetry a long time ago because I could use it to have my own voice, whereas in acting, obviously you try to take work that you think is good and represents you, but you don’t always have that luxury. So poetry is a way of being creative and having an outlet when you are not working in something that’s creatively interesting or fulfilling. And between jobs, I always have to do something that’s creative.”It was to her poetry she turned when she was invited to do a Ted Talk last year, reciting a poem she wrote that was inspired by Maya Angelou.“I’ve always thought of Ted Talks as being very intellectual, where you have to have a great invention or know about a particular topic so I wasn’t sure whether I deserved to be doing it or what I should do, but I thought what an honour! And I decided to speak from my experience, so it was ‘Being Black, being a Woman, being ‘Other’ and hopefully that strikes a chord with others, everyone who has felt Other.” And it felt natural to put poetry in there.” Anouka went on to talk about her crowdfunding a screening of Black Panther, the  black superhero film now tipped for an Oscar, for kids in her local area of Peckham because she thought it was an important film for them to see, a film that reflected the ‘other’ and underscored the belief that everyone was entitled to fulfilment and a voice no matter their creed, sexuality, culture or gender. “I couldn’t believe how much we raised. So much more than I expected that I’ve got a bit of money left over. We extended the screening so many more kids got to see it and I’ve given money to charities who work with young people, but I really want to do another film screening. That film was such a special thing, so it’s hard to know what the next film to do that for would be. But I’ll definitely do it again.” As for ersity, Anouka feels inspired by the changes she sees in the acting world, citing Sophie Okonedo, who recently won an Evening Standard Best Actress Award for her performance with Ralph Fiennes in Antony and Cleopatra. “She works in film, TV and theatre, which is a dream of mine. And she was in Undercover with Adrian Lester, who is a legend.”It was Lester who presented Anouka with the Ian Charleston Commendation Award for Shakespeare for Under s and having followed his career ever since, she was delighted to play his daughter in Trauma.“I think things are changing, definitely on stage particularly, it’s going in the right direction, but you can always do more. I think theatre is ahead of TV and film in this country, but I see it improving and more exciting stuff coming out.” “Queen Margaret was an example of that. Rather than just re-telling Shakespeare, it changed the lens we’re looking through, so it was all through Queen Margaret’s eyes.”Having played three of Shakespeare’s great male roles Anouka would love to take on more. “God there are so many. Loads of good ones!” she says and laughs. “I’d do LOADS of them! I’ve said before I’ve wanted to play Hamlet. Obviously it was written as a male role, but I see the character, not as a male character, but as a young adult, not quite knowing how to deal with grief and finding out about relationships, romance, all of these things coming in at once. It very much feels like showing somebody turning into an adult, and it’s something I would love to do before I get too old.”Anouka doesn’t talk about her age in a bid not to be tied down to age specic roles, witness her convincing teenager in Trauma. Similarly, she doesn’t talk about who she shares her south-east London flat or le with, apart from rescue dog Evie, who is possibly half Yorkie half Bichon Frise, “I’ve never seen another dog like her, so we’re waiting for a DNA test, just to see,” she laughs.As someone who has been in Doctor Who twice, Anouka has nothing but praise for Jodie Whittaker’s take on the Time Lord. “I wasn’t the right age for it when it came back – it was my little sister that watched it, but then I was in it and I thought gosh, it’s brilliant, are they all like this  And it’s not just brilliant entertainment, but important to watch, like the Rosa Parks episode. School children should all have to watch that episode, it was a great history lesson.”“And it’s important when you’re growing up to see things reflecting of your le, someone who maybe looks a bit like you, and more and more we need someone to do exactly this, be bold like Doctor Who and then the impact is going to be enormous.

Cleaning Up’s like that, full of women leads, and you just don’t see that.” Next up, Anouka is in the new Idris Elba comedy, Turn Up Charlie, a series of eight half hour episodes for Netflix. She plays a DJ who is an arch rival to Elba’s character, a failing DJ working as a nanny to an out of control -year-old. “It’s nice to be doing comedy. Cleaning Up has humour in it but it’s lighthearted and heartwarming and sometimes dark, rather than actively trying to make you laugh. But this is more of a comedy and it’s out next year, so that’ll be good. Often people don’t think of me for comedy because I’ve done a lot of Shakespeare on stage and stuff, but I like it. I’d like to do more.” And since she’s as much about words as action, we’ll give the final one to Anouka and the call to action with which she ended her Ted Talk and summed up her attitude to inclusivity and embracing the Other in all of us: “When you get that chance, that opportunity, that seat at the table, get creative.

The UK Government’s ramping up of no-deal contingency plans – with exercises involving scores of delivery lorries in Kent – should act as a “wake-up call” to MPs about the “insanity” of proceeding down that path, he added.Putting aside the fact that any MP sleeping, even metaphorically, at such a moment of national crisis should not hold elected office, it gives hope that the SNP is prepared to work across party lines for the good of the UK as a whole.: Government planning ‘live test’ of disruption caused by no-deal BrexitIt can be politically dangerous for any party member to take such a step – “collaborating with the enemy” would be an easy charge for those who bandy about words like “treason” and “enemies of the people”. But now is the time for MPs to be brave. It is nothing less than their patriotic duty. A no-deal Brexit – a far cry from the pre-referendum visions of the Leave campaign – would address few of the sources of public discontent that contributed to the result of the  vote and create new ones, with all the evidence pointing to a signicant blow to the economy, possibly even on a par with the  financial crash. So MPs who are the most implacable foes of the SNP must work with them and the SNP must not turn any potential allies away. Party leaders, whips and constituency chairs must be defiedneeds be.In the event that May pulls off a surprise victory in the Commons’ vote, then Brexit will go ahead.Butit fails, the only sensible course of action is to delay the UK’s departure from the EU beyond the current  March date to enable a second referendum or a general election or further negotiations with Brussels or anything – anything at all – that avoids a no-deal.We are about to live through a decisive moment in British history.

A . per cent rise in off-peak fares doesn’t seem too steep by comparison.Racking up the cost on top of ScotRail’s miserable  per cent punctuality record this year was a gt for television news, with BBC Scotland’s coverage of the story comprising vox-pops of disgruntled travellers complaining about poor service, a half-hearted response from the operator about continued investment, and a grizzly union official demanding renationalisation. When the ScotRail franchise was awarded to Abellio in , opponents of privatised rail services were quick to point out it was a subsidiary of the publicly owned Dutch operator, Nederlandse Spoorwegen , but as with ScotRail it’s not responsible for track and station infrastructure so it’s not easy to identy what a government-owned concern would achieve that the Dutch firm cannot.It’s easier to point to what has happened to rail transport since privatisation in , such as a massive increase in passenger numbers , investment and government supportand a reliable system of performance measurement with a fines system for poor results. Imagine the Scottish Government fining itself £. million as it did Abellio last year.: Michael Matheson: Train fares increase ‘unwelcome’This year’s customer surveys recorded satisfaction rates of  per cent for both ScotRail and NS, but although a wide disparity in punctuality tells a dferent story Abellio NS can hardly be accused of not knowing what to do about it. In East Anglia, where it runs the Greater Anglia franchise, Abellio has just pumped in an extra £m, which can be argued comes from Dutch commuters. If the answer is more money, so far Abellio has only asked for an advance on the subsidy expected from the Scottish Government next year because of unexpected shortfalls caused largely by infrastructure problems which are the responsibility of the Network Rail. Nationalised Network Rail.Were the Scottish Government to take on ScotRail as well, political pressure would be entirely on the Transport Secretary’s shoulders at least Michael Matheson can presently pass the buck to Abellio rather than having to explain why he can’t get the trains to run on time himself. UK Transport Secretary Chris Grayling regularly gets hammered for poor rail performance partly because Network Rail’s tracks lead directly to his desk. And as he and those whose journeys were repeatedly disrupted by strike action in the past will testy, nationalisation turns industrial relations into a political weapon. Public subsidy and public ownership are not the same thing.: Train ‘rip-off’ as punctuality falls while fares increaseBut one way or another, money has to come from somewhere andpassengers don’t pay then it has to come from general taxation. Not true, say supporters of state-ownership who argue that cheap government borrowing is a better way to fund investment. Like, say, the £m the Scottish Government has had to pump into loss-making Prestwick Airport since buying it for £ five years ago  More consensually, it has invested £.bn in Calmac ferries in the last ten years. Through borrowing or higher taxes, either way the financial pressure falls on all tax-payers rather than being shouldered primarily by those who use the service. Dutch trains might be more punctual, but the inidual Dutch income tax burden is heavier everyone pays at least nine per cent, the  per cent higher income tax rate kicks in at approximately £, compared to Scotland’s £,and the top rate is  per cent compared to  here.So here’s an idea for a TV vox-pop next time there is a rail fare increase. Go to a bus queue and ask those passengersthey’d like to pay more to improve the railways. OrPrestwick Airport is good value for their money.Labour in splitters spatOn the subject of testing opinions,the Prime Minister wants any encouragement about the possible outcome of a Commons vote on a second EU referendum, she need look no further than Sean Duffy, secretary of the Scottish Labour Campaign For Socialism, and research assistant to Scottish Labour’s Brexit spokesman Neil Findlay MSP. The People’s Vote is an “astroturf campaign designed to split Labour”, he said in a now deleted Tweet, to which Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray MP responded, “The only people who want the party to split is the hard left.” Together we stand, comrades.Meet the real BorrowersAll enterprises borrow against future income to fund investments and predicting high passenger numbers in a densely populated area is how Edinburgh Council plans to finance the £m it will cost to complete the tram line to Newhaven. Governments can borrow cheaply because taxation income is relatively reliable.Similarly, former First Minister Alex Salmond’s engraved boulder at Heriot-Watt University to mark his pledge that “the rocks will melt with the sun” before tuition fees are introduced, is a good reason Heriot-Watt has doubled its borrowing to £m to fund new facilities. As long as the Government pays Scottish students to study, income is guaranteed. Accordingly, Glasgow has doubled its arrangements to £m and Edinburgh is on a £m splurge on the never-never.While the number of home-grown students can’t go on rising for as long as it takes the sun to expire without compromising standards, signs that the lucrative post-graduate market is slowing down must question the financial sustainability. Even when the UK leaves the EU and Scottish universities can start charging European students, they will still essentially be borrowing on the tax-payer.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4852241.1546694823!/image/image.jpg","title":"parents blast scotrail over botched roll out of 1 child fare","story":"Some parents have been forced to pay full ticket prices for their children to travel on ScotRail services after a botched roll-out of the # child fare.An IT problem meant some families travelling this week were told the ‘Kids For A Quid’ tarf had not yet been uploaded on the system, so children would have to pay the full fare price.

The lorries will descend on Manston airfield in Kent, which will act as a holding area in the event of a backlog at Channel ports.As the UK government dramatically steps up its preparation for a no-deal outcome, the SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said it would be “insanity” for the UK to crash out of the EU without a Brexit agreement.The Commons has until \u2028 January to approve the terms of Brexit put forward by the government, ahead of exit day on  March. However, there is little sign of consensus emerging for any alternative, with Prime Minister Theresa May’s allies in the DUP refusing to back her and Conservative Party members telling pollsters they prefer a no-deal exit.The lorry testing exercise comes amid concern over the awarding of a contract for emergency ferry services to a brand new company that owns no ships and which was found to have copied the terms and conditions published on its website from a fast food delivery service.Meanwhile, a dredging firm hired by the government has started work to prepare the port of Ramsgate,  miles north of Dover, as a relief route for essential supplies in the event of a no-deal Brexit.The SNP has committed to vote against the Prime Minister’s proposed Brexit deal, but has called on the government to rule out leaving without any agreement with the EU.The Nationalists say Brexit must be put off by extending Article  to allow more time for an alternative to emerge, and that the public must have the final say through a fresh referendum that includes the option of staying in the EU.Mr Blackford, who has been briefed on the government’s full confidential no-deal plans, said: “I fear we are running out of time to meet the deadlines that are looming, not just in March, but also in January.“MPs on all sides need to take what the government is doing as a wake-up call, that a no-deal Brexit is unthinkable and must be stopped.“Every party needs to take their responsibility and do everything in their power to find a way out of this mess. Actually going through with the plans being tested and rolled out would be insanity.”In a letter to hauliers from the Department for Transportand Kent County Council yesterday, officials said “Operation Brock” will see tests run during the morning rush hour at am and again at am to “establish the safest optimum release rate of HGVs” from Manston Airfield to Dover along local A-roads.A DfT spokeswoman said: “We do not want or expect a no-deal scenario and continue to work hard to deliver a deal with the EU.“However, it is the duty of a responsible government to continue to prepare for all eventualities and contingencies, including a possible no deal.“We will be testing part of Operation Brock to ensure that,it needs to be implemented, the system is fully al.”MPs are due to debate the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal on Wednesday ahead of a “meaningful vote” the following week, but the EU has yet to offer any changes to the controversial Irish border backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland under Brussels regulations to prevent a hard borderno trade deal is agreed by the end of .Mrs May spoke to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker yesterday in an effort to secure more flexibility. A European Commission spokesman said: “President Juncker had a friendly phone call with PM May. They agreed to stay in touch next week.”The government’s hopes of convincing Conservative Brexiteers of backing the deal were dealt a new blow with the publication of a poll suggesting more than half of grassroots Tories support leaving the EU without an agreement.In a three-way choice,  per cent said they would support leaving the EU without an agreement, while  per cent would back the Prime Minister’s deal and  per cent would choose to remain. Some  per cent had no preference.The research, carried out by YouGov for the Party Members Project, also suggested a two-way referendum would see  per cent of Tory members endorse the PM’s stance, with  per cent voting for a no-deal Brexit.A leading figure in the DUP also closed the door on a compromise, saying there was “no way” the party would support Mrs May’s proposed Brexit deal. DUP MP Sammy Wilson said he was “more alarmed” than ever over the backstop. The comments follow a statement by the DUP’s leader at Westminster rebuffing Downing Street’s efforts to win the Unionists over.Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said on Thursday his party’s “principled objections” to the backstop remain, with no sign of any further concessions from the EU side.Mr Wilson said yesterday: “It’s not just because of the regulations which Northern Ireland would be subject to with the backstop, but also the fact we would have to treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country.”He also claimed the backstop was “a con trick all along”.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"vandalism incident takes place in sumburgh airport car park ","story":"Police are appealing for information after three cars had their windows smashed at Sumburgh Airport.Each of the vehicles, which were parked in the main car park, had their door windows smashed.The incident is believed to have happened between pm on Monday and am on Wednesday.Police are asking anyone with information to contact , or attend Lerwick Police Station..."},{"url":null,"title":"creative project manager at shetland arts ","story":"Shetland Arts are seeking a Creative Project Manager to help drive forward our vision of a creative, connected Shetland that values art, culture and creativity, and the positive impact it can have on everyone’s le.The Creative Project Manager will be responsible for delivering a strategy that supports and inspires creative practice, formal and informal learning, outreach, performance, exhibition and programming opportunities throughout Shetland.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line. It cannot and will not be abandoned or renegotiated,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27508  ","story":" Síle DarraghWhen young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this state, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing.

When the Repeal result was read out a sign was held aloft, ‘The North is next’. Rights transcend borders and so does this generation. will mark the centenary of the First Dáil. A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27510  ","story":"Civil Rights marchers attacked at Burntollet Bridge.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

Arlene Foster’s erstwhile photo companion has been busying himself of late on the Kilcooley bonfire in Bangor, which he’s determined to ensure is the biggest and the best in Are Wee Country.First up, Squinter’s not sure what Science Dee is a Bachelor of Honours in – the UDA man doesn’t say. But from the tweets about the appliance of structural engineering science to the massive edice, it might appear that it is in that field of endeavour that he excelled at university. We might be tempted to speculate on what university handed the qualication over to him, given the quality of the spelling on his Twitter account, but let’s stick to the matter in hand.On Thursday, as the bonfire crept out of the North Down troposphere and into the stratosphere, Dee gave vent to the vaunting pride that’s filling his barrel chest as the race for the title of Biggest Boney came down to the final furlong: “Kilcooley Bonfire, Well on its way to be Ulster Biggest .

Nothing could be further from the truth. At university I was a founder member of the ‘Campaign to Save Ulster Bus Stops’ and I wrote a very well-received pamphlet which I distributed to membersentitled ‘Classic Bus Stops of Markethill and Richhill – Ulster’s Hidden History’. Furthermore, I have on occasion been on a bus, although admittedly not for a while. That the Glider stop I referred to is near the Short Strand is not in question, but since when did geographical proximity have anything to do with naming things  The Donegal Celtic football club on the Suffolk Road is not in Donegal. The Dublin Road is not in Dublin. Even the Woodstock Road is not in Woodstock, which most people are unaware of . So calling the stop Short Strand because it is near the Short Strand makes zero sense and is in fact potentially confusing. What is this place coming to when routes can’t be changed or amended just because they are traditional  SEPTEMBERSCOTLAND’S Shame, it’s called – the ,lb gorilla in the Holyrood Parliament that nobody wants to speak about. Many and frequent are the manestations of anti-Catholic sentiment at the very core of Scottish society, but the antics this week of a senior Labour Party official at the party conference in Liverpool has seen the issue reach a wider audience and that may make it rather more dficult for it to remain a dirty secret. Speaking from the , Scotsman Andy Kerr, Chairman of the Labour Party’s ruling National Executive Committee, invited a woman to speak and then added: “Did you cross yourself there  In that case I might not.” Not surprisingly, the ‘joke’ went down like a fart in a space suit as Andy obviously forgot that he wasn’t speaking before a select audience in Glasgow. The apology wasn’t long coming “unreservedly” with Andy adding: “I was trying to be lighthearted but what I said was ill-judged and wrong.” Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: “People from all parties and none will be appalled by this and by the casual dismissal of concerns.” Much as Squinter cheered Ruth’s decisive intervention, he must reluctantly point out that her party has blotted its copybook in the recent past when it comes to the matter of Catholics in Scotland. Last year a Conservative member of Stirling Council was readmitted to the party after being suspended for posting anti-Catholic comments online. Alastair Majury tweeted: “Why is the Catholic Church against birth control  Because they#ll run out of children to molest.”Of course, had Andy Kerr made a religiously loaded remark like the one he did about Catholics about, say, Muslims, or Jews, he wouldn’t have seen the end of the day. But in situ he remains, at the very heart of a party currently struggling with allegations of anti-Semitism which so far have not been solid enough to see any heads roll. The Zionist lobby which is after Jeremy Corbyn’s head would surely have claimed their first victory had this remark been aimed in the direction of Judaism. Perhaps you’ll remember that in July the Orange Order called off a parade in Glasgow. They called it off rather than obey a direction not to walk past a Catholic church where at a previous Orange Order march a priest had been spat at and struck with a baton by parade followers. Now the socialists have joined the KKK. Jings, crivvens, help m’boab!OCTOBERWHAT IS THE BACKSTOP The factsAn insurance policydesigned to avoid a hard border in the event that a customs agreement cannot be agreed by the end of the transition period . If no agreement is reached, the EU wants to see the north remaining in the Single Market and Customs Union until London comes up with a solution. Under pressure from hardliners, British Prime Minister Theresa May wants the backstop done away with or, at the very least, subject to a time limit.The loyal Ulster factsKeeping the Pravince in the Single Market and Customs Union while the rest of the UK leaves is an existential threat to the future of Are Wee Country and the DUP is battling to “save the union”. The party is clear that there can be no ergence within the UK, except on things that it wants to erge on, gyeh morrage and abortion, for instance. A DUP source has promised to up the pressure on the Tory government: “We are going to squeeze their balls until their ears bleed.”Promises, promises# NOVEMBERWhich brings us to James McClean. Again. Since last year’s Remembrance Day festival the Derry native and Republic of Ireland international has switched clubs from West Brom to Stoke. In order to keep their fans informed ahead of the annual wearing of the poppy football shirts across the English leagues, the club issued a brief statement outlining the player’s historical stance and confirming that he wouldn’t be sporting a poppy on his shirt this year either.Despite the fact that nothing had changed – other than the name of the club at the top of the press release – the statement sent the Pravince’s media to DefCon , just as it has since the day and hour James spoke his first words on the topic, occasioning the familiar angry social media blast from Ulster’s stout yeomanry. There’s a delicious and very fitting circularity in this local saga:just as nothing has changed in relation to James McClean and the poppy, nothing has changed in Ulster’s attitude to it.DECEMBERA BURNING question finally gets its answer. No, it’s not about Brexit, or world hunger, or famine or plague. It’s simply this: what do you call this item pictured below left  You may never have given the matter any thought, but Squinter has, because, well# because that’s the kind of guy he is. Fact of the matter is that you’re very unlikely ever to ask for one because  out of every thousand of these things sold are simply lted by the customer and brought to the counter or check-out without a word. If you have a shopping list it will simply say ‘milk’ and everyone knows exactly how large or how small their milk requirements are.But every time Squinter buys one he asks himself why he doesn’t have a clue what it’s called and, further,a tourist asked him what it was he wouldn’t be able to answer. So, enough being enough, Squinter put the question to Twitter – and back came around  replies, some of them fairly sensible, some#. Quart.. Barrackbuster.. Big milk.. Flagon Jar.. Green milk..

That gap in our knowledge has now been put right with the the timely publication of the powerful ‘War Against All Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America’s Colony’ by accomplished journalist Nelson A. Denis. His book sweeps through the many humiliations heaped on Puerto Ricans after the US invasion of , such as a ban on Spanish in schools and a prohibition against the flying of the nation’s flag. Where the American government led, business followed. Suffocating poverty on the island and slave-like conditions on the sugar plantations worsened. The first civilian governor Charles Allen ed to the US and leveraged his contacts and influence to become the King of Sugar. “By ,” writes Denis, “Allen and US banking interests had converted  per cent of all arable land in Puerto Rico into sugar plantations. These bank syndicates also owned the insular postal system, the entire coastal railroad, and the international seaport of San Juan.”Patriots responded with their own Nationalist Party but its ranks were riddled with FBI informers and when that didn’t stymie its growth, supporters were massacred in the town of Ponce. On Sunday March  , a parade of unarmed nationalist cadets was effectively ambushed by police in scenes similar to our own Bloody Sunday. “The police kept shooting and clubbing for thirteen minutes,” says Denis. “By the time they finished,  men, one woman and a seven-year-old girl lay dead over  more were gravely wounded — moaning, crawling, bleeding, and begging for mercy in the street.# marked the high-point of this revolutionary rising when, following  years of military occupation, the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico staged an unsuccessful armed insurrection.They paid a heavy price for tweaking the tale of the tiger. Ill-trained and poorly-equipped cadres of nationalists – branded communists by the powers-that-be – were cut down by US National Guard troops. In the town of Jayuya where revolutionaries had seized control, the residents were subjected to a merciless bombardment by ten Thunderbolt fighter planes armed with -lb bombs. It was the only time in history that the United States bombed its own citizens.Within a fortnight, the rebellion had been quashed but not before a failed assassination attempt on President Truman had ensured the tiny island nation’s freedom struggle made headlines around the world. The nationalists paid a heavy price: vengeful prison sentences were meted out to the leaders and activists. One woman, Blanca Canales, served  years of a le sentence for burning the post office in Jayuya — the same town levelled by US planes. Their incarcerated leader Pedro Albizu Campos was subject to brutal conditions right out of the Gulag Archipelago — and then some. In , he was exposed to radiation poisoning which led to visible burns on his extremities, swelling of his face and led to a stroke which left him paralysed. Thus ended the long struggle of the revolutionary who had parlayed with De Valera and raised money for the Irish liberation movement in Boston in  — at one point he spoke in front of , people in Sanders Theatre in Boston and delivered what was described, by an English lord no less who was present, as “the most complete, the most brilliant speech” on Irish freedom ever heard. The  years which followed his death in  were, says Denis, “a downward spiral of chaos and corruption that turned the island into a punch-drunk fighter, unsure of its whereabouts, wobbling on its feet, pawing at empty air”.It’s hard to argue that things have improved of late. Emigration is the only route to meaningful work for an entire generation: In  alone, it lost a net , residents or nearly . per cent of its population. In , the island went bankrupt with the US Government refusing to come to its aid. In , Puerto Rico was hammered by a Hurricane Maria — the worst natural disaster to ever hit the island. “Is there a solution to all this ” asks Denis. “Of course, but the complicated ones rarely work. Those that have been tried include corporate tax subsidies to giant pharmaceutical companies, a fraudulent war on drugs, government subsidies, austerity programmes, and real estate speculation. These ‘solutions’ breed government fraud, police corruption, absentee ownership, junk bonds, media spin, and rampant hotels, shopping malls and parking lots. The answer may be much simpler. It starts with an honest self-appraisal. It acknowledges the eviction of an entire people — literally and systematically — from their own land.”Nelson Denis has done a service to the people of Puerto Rico — his people — and to the wider world watching on with this authoritative history of a brave island people. He has, at last, put Puerto Rico on the map."},{"url":null,"title":"blow as ballymena company goes bust with 58","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is the latest blow to the manufacturing and engineering industries, which have experienced severe job cuts in recent years. The company, which was established in , was one of Northern Irelands longest-established electrical and mechanical contractors, working across the commercial, industrial, leisure, healthcare and retail sectors.Gerard Gildernew, of Gildernew  Co Accountants and Insolvency Specialists, has been appointed as administrator by the company directors.The administrator is currently assessing the options available to the business and the  staff have been notied of the situation, with a further meeting scheduled for next week. The administrator is also in the process of notying the firms suppliers. Founder and managing director of JBE, John Blair, said: \"It is with the deepest regret and profound sadness that we have been forced to take the step of placing the company in administration after  years of successful trading. \"In recent years, despite the challenging market conditions, we worked relentlessly to maintain a profitable business, however, the struggle became overwhelming due to signicant losses incurred on several Scottish contracts and we could no longer maintain our position. \"I would like to place on record my appreciation of the skills and expertise of JBEs hard-working employees and recognise their professionalism and loyalty throughout.\"The announcement comes as a new blow to the east and mid-Antrim economy after multiple local and big brand names - including tyre manufacturer Michelin and the JTI Gallaher tobacco factory - have closed in recent years. In November, the closure of Ahoghill-based Hayburn Wood Products resulted in  staff losing jobs. And Antrim-based door frame manufacturer, the Camden Group, announced up to  job losses. In October  JTI announced it was closing its Co Antrim plant with the loss of  jobs.And in  Michelin closed its Ballymena factory, cutting  manufacturing jobs.Commenting on the latest jobs loss, North Antrim DUP MLA Paul Frew said: \"This is yet another blow to the Ballymena economy and I am greatly saddened to hear the news today. \"As always I will be in contact with the company and its employees to give any support needed.\"Having worked for the company myself in the past, I know that many will have fond memories of their time as an employee. The company was well known for its high standard of work and professionalism, winning very prestigious contracts both at home and overseas. \"It will be a loss to the town and importantly the employees, particularly at this time of year.\"Ballymena has suffered many job losses. Small business in the area will feel the impact of this with a reduced market, not forgetting those who traded with JBE,\" he said.\"I hope that by working together solutions can be found as soon as poss ible to help boost the economy and the livelihood of people in the area. \"However, today my thoughts are with those who will feel this news most acutely, therefore it is important that we ensure everything is done to minimise the impact.\""},{"url":null,"title":"meet the brexitbashing twitter account followed by leo varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\". State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mr Ryan also said people across Britain wrote to their MPs demanding greater action against terrorists.The two plain-clothed British soldiers inadvertently drove into the path of the funeral before mourners pulled them from the car and were beaten before being shot dead by members of the IRA.The murders happened days after the funerals of the three IRA members who were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain Mr Ryan said after meeting backbenchers at Westminster, he was struck by their exasperation and anger \"without any proper sense of how to ventilate it\" while there was a resurgence of \"frustrated patience\" with Ireland.\"The complexity of the issues elude their instinctual approach to policy questions, that of self-interested pragmatism and this further fuels their primary response to events such as last Saturdays,\" he added. State papers: Thatcher warned Haughey of worst civil war everUK allowed Irish unity \"It has to be said that no amount of violence toward the UDR, the RUC and Northern Irish or Irish civilians of any religious persuasion could come anywhere near provoking the same reaction in Britain to Saturdays killings - and the sort of killings they were - of their own English soldiers.\"He later said there was a risk the Anglo-Irish relationship and the Agreement may be \"caught in the net\" when MPs look for the reasons behind the murders.Days after the killings, the Secretary of State Tom King, made a speech to the House of Commons in which he described the \"horric events\" that shocked the world. State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"alexa can now help nfl newbies understand the american sport","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A photo released by the agency showed the rover stopped at a point not far from where the Chang’e  spacecraft touched down on Thursday.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Chang’e , named after a Chinese moon goddess, is the first craft to make a soft landing on the moon’s far side, which faces away from Earth. Previous landings, including one by China’s Chang’e  in , have been on the near side.After sending the rover off from a ramp, the spacecraft deployed three low-frequency radio antennas, the Chinese space agency said. Chang’e  also has sent back images taken with a topographical camera.Researchers hope that low-frequency observations of the cosmos from the far side, where radio signals from Earth are blocked by the moon, will help scientists learn more about the early days of the solar system and even the birth of the universe’s first stars.Hard University astronomer Avi Loeb noted, however, that the relay satellite needed to send back information from the far side also contaminates the sky.“As long as we keep it clean of radio interference, the far side of the moon is very good for radio astronomy,” he said.The far side has been observed many times from lunar orbits, but never explored on the surface. It is popularly called the “dark side” because it cannot be seen from Earth and is relatively unknown, not because it lacks sunlight.“It’s just the far side, it can be either dark or light,” Mr Loeb said, depending on the time of day.The pioneering landing highlights China’s ambitions to rival the US, Russia and Europe in space. Both China’s space community and public have taken pride in the accomplishment, with some drawing comparisons to the United States."},{"url":null,"title":"alley theatre launch new saturday morning guitar club","story":"The Alley Theatre are offering the public the opportunity to develop their guitar playing skills at a new club every Saturday morning from this week .The tuition will be delivered by local musician Ciaran Gallen and is an excellent opportunity for people to develop your skills whether you’re an absolute beginner, an experienced musician or at any point in between.Ciaran has been playing the guitar for the past  years teaching in schools all around the North West and facilitating workshops.A regular at the Alley Theatre Ciaran also hosts the very popular Original Sinners nights giving local musicians an opportunity to play their ‘original’ music in front of a live audience.“I am thrilled to be starting these classes in the Alley Theatre.

Receiving the MBE is just totally surreal.ldquoIrsquom overwhelmed the work I do in safeguarding children and women has been recognised by the Queen.Sheila started to work as a front line practitioner in the field of social work  years ago. Today, she is Social Work Manager for the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust.She is also the chairperson of the South Eastern Area Domestic and Sexual Violence Abuse Partnership, a multi-disciplinary and inter-agency made up of voluntary and statutory community groups like Sure Start, Womenrsquos Aid and PSNI.Sheila said social workers were used to being on the receiving end of unwarranted bad publicity, but were expected by society to protect vulnerable children.She said: ldquoI first began to understand domestic violence when I became a social worker. I quickly realised it was prevalent in a lot of families.ldquoThankfully, society is beginning to talk about it more. ldquoWe need to continue to talk about it because it is so dficult for anyone living with domestic violence to tell their story and it is extremely dficult for children.ldquoThey are scared to speak out because they remain afraid of what might happen to themthey told an outside organisation. Sometimes, their silence is due to them feeling ashamed or even responsible for the abuse they are dealing with.Sheila understood quite early in le about the effects of trauma. Her elder brother, Eugene, disappeared on New Yearrsquos Day  when Sheila was in her early teens.His three children came to live with her family and she saw how her own mother and father were able to make their lives as normal as possible which led to some healing for all of them.The tragedy was the inspiration behind a play called, The Ferryman which debuted in London recently.ldquoMy role is tough, she explains, ldquobut social workers are our own support network. We meet with a lot of anger and abuse. It can be challenging but it can also be rewarding. Many people do come back to us to say thank you or, they will say to us that wersquove helped to turn their le around. That is said to us more frequently than anything . Thatrsquos what keeps us doing the job. We are the source from which change is possible. Everyone has the potential to change and I see it played out time and time again.It is evident that Sheila is dedicated to the families she protects. She said: ldquoDomestic violence is quite prevalent in Northern Ireland. One in six women and one in nine men will live with it including their children some time in their le.ldquoPolice are called to an incident every  minutes. Curiously, it is this time of year that sees a spike in those figures. Christmas Day and New Yearrsquos Day will see the highest numbers of women and children call the police for help.ldquoAnd, I do think the timing of this MBE from the Queen will only serve to raise awareness of this issue. And might even help someone who is suffering abuse to pick up the phone and ask for help.Sheila advises that anyone who wishes to make a call should contact   , which is completely confidential. It is available to all men and women affected by domestic and sexual violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for upgrade at Ardglass harbour  ","story":"THE need for major improvements at Ardglass harbour to allow signicantly larger vessels to enter the port has been highlighted by former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie.Her comments come after last monthrsquos annual EU Fisheries Council meeting in Brussels which determines how much fish can be landed at the local port and at the neighbouring harbours of Kilkeel and Portavogie.EU chiefs have decided to reduce prawn quotas by just over % to ensure the species ldquostays within sustainable levels, while the herring quota has been reduced by %.The Fisheries Council also determines how many days boats can put to sea, but the December meeting will have been the last UK fishermen were represented at ahead of the Brexit at the end of March.Welcoming some of the outcomes from the Brussels negotiations, Miss Ritchie has urged British and Irish governments to resolve what she described as ldquooutstanding problems in the fisheries sector to build the economies at the three Co Down fishing ports.She explained that the Fisheries Council consists of EU Fisheries Ministers who decide on the annual quota allocations for range of species mdash including prawns and white fish mdash which are the main staple of Northern Ireland fishermen.Miss Ritchie said she was concerned there has been a slight decrease in the amount of prawns which can be landed locally, after a series of successive quota increases over recent years.ldquoIt is important that the British Government has realistic proposals capable of implementation in place to safeguard and grow our local industry, said Ms Ritchie.ldquoThere are also other fishing issues that require resolution as they present ongoing challenges to the catching and processing sectors. They include the Voisinage Agreement with the Irish Government to allow Co Down fishermen to resume fishing in Irish Sea waters. There is also the need for improvements to harbour infrastructure at Ardglass and Kilkeel to allow larger boats to land fish.Miss Ritchie said the prawn quota reduction was more to do with the species being exempted from so-called discard ban.She added: ldquoIt is vitally important that our local fishing industry in the catching and processing sectors is allowed to continue to grow and develop.ldquoThe Government needs to continue with a positive working relationship with the industry to allow the economic sectors in Ardglass and Kilkeel to be nurtured to ensure existing jobs are sustained and new employment opportunities are realised.Mr Alan McCulla, chief executive of the Anglo-North Irish Fish Producers Organisation Sea Source, believes the outcome of the annual negotiation on catch quotas ldquoputs Northern Irelandrsquos fishermen in a good starting position for the next phase in our relationship with the EU.He said the agreements reached at the Fisheries Council meeting offered ldquosome positives and some negatives for the Irish Sea, with the December negotiations described by the Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairsas ldquoone of the most dficult councils in recent years.A spokesperson for the government department said it was vitally important to ensure that sufficient quota was obtained for all Irish Sea fish species to enable them to land all the fish they catch from the start of the New Year, particularly whiting which is a by-catch in the prawn fishery.ldquoThe EU Commission initially proposed an Irish Sea whiting quota of  tonnes but this was successfully negotiated up by % to  tonnes, with agreement to carry out a further review of the quota in the new year.The government department spokesperson said the deal ldquoensures that there are now workable solutions to alleviate the pressure for fishermen while preventing fish from being wastefully discarded unnecessarily..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan tree voted top in NI  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Parkrsquos giant redwood is celebrating being voted Northern Irelandrsquos Tree of the Year in the Woodland Trustrsquos search for the countryrsquos best-loved tree.The stunning redwood mdash or multi-stemmed giant sequoia to be precise mdash finished second in the  UK final.Everyone associated with the Forest Service, the people of Castlewellan and ious groups helping with ambitious regeneration proposals at the stunning forest park, are delighted with the majestic treersquos success in the regional heat.The giant redwood stands within the walled garden at the forest park and at over  years old has seen centuries come and go.

The Hoops raced into a - first half lead with goals from Stephen Galbraithand Sean McMahon before Jordan McCoubrey delivered the coup de grace in the th minute to finally kill off a game Olympic outfit.Celtic looked the more composed and inventive side from the off and an understrength Olympic struggled to create anything of note. The Hoops seized the lead with only six and a half minutes gone and never looked back.Chris Mullan, who was like a fleet-footed gazelle down the left flank and just missed out on the man of the match award, sped past his marker on the edge of the box.His stinging shot that looked destined for the bottom corner of the net was parried out by an alert Ryan Connollly, but Galbraith was hovering around the six-yard box and was perfectly placed to steer the ball home.Less than two minutes later Mullan dipped his shoulder again and cut inside Jack Roddy before striking the base of the post with a fierce shot.Olympic steadfastly refused to buckle and with  minutes gone were unlucky not to equalise when Aaron McCaffrey, their most potent player in attack, was unable to take advantage in a rare moment of panic in the Celtic box.Celtic went back on the attack and with  minutes gone taskmaster Jordan Curran teamed up with Mullan to create an opening for Sean McMahon, but he fired wide.Back at the other end, the dangerous McCaffrey got in behind Conor Doherty, but his delightfully flighted cross missed by everyone in the box.With  minutes gone Rottweiler Curran blocked an Olympic attempt to send Rhys Patterson clear. The ball flew off his shin and into the path of the willing Sean McMahon who raced away from Michael Rice and Darryl Russell, but with only Connolly to beat, his cheeky, dinked effort grazed the crossbar on the way to safety.A minute later another mazy Mullan run ended with the wing wizard crossing for McMahon, but this seasonrsquos top scorer had his audacious effort blocked on the six yard box with Celtic claiming a penalty.The second goal wasnrsquot long in coming and with  minutes gone a Mullan cross was deftly headed home by Doherty, who had been given the freedom of the box. Three minutes later Galbraith made it - when his low corner evaded Connolly at his near post and ended up in the net.Celtic continued their dominance after the break with Mullan and McMahon dovetailing perfectly for Curran, but his shot went well over the top. With  minutes gone McMahon decided to go it alone, but he was well off target as Olympic backed off him.Olympic tried desperately to get things moving, but it just wasnrsquot their day and with  minutes played Russell did exceptionally well to prevent Galbraith from making it - with a last-gasp tackle.The fourth goal was just around the corner and with  minutes gone Andy Baggley headed the ball into the path of prodigy Jordan McCoubrey, who looked suspiciously offside. The teenage terrier didnrsquot hang around as Olympic had pushed up and he raced cleat to beat Connolly all ends up.If anything, Celtic could have won by an even bigger margin and Connolly saved brilliantly in the th minute to deny Baggley a fth Celtic goal.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Shaun Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Mikey Rice, Jordan Curran, Terence Bell, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan.

QUB said last month that it was putting on hold an arrangement of over  years standing, whereby it sends undergraduate theology students to be trained by the Presbyterian Church’s ministry training college in Belfast,The university said this was due to “concerns regarding the breadth and ersity of the teaching and curriculum being delivered” at Union Theological College . The findings were made as part of a surprise review, announced in June, only days after Presbyterian elders from across the island voted overwhelmingly to adopt a highly controversial policy which excludes anyone in a same sex relationship from full membership. However the DUP has now stepped into the row. “The decision by Queen’s University to suspend undergraduate programmes in Theology, which were delivered through Union Theological College, has resulted in concern, anger and confusion,” DUP MLAs Christopher Stalford and Gordon Lyons told the News Letter. The MLAs said school leavers will now no longer be able to study a non-vocational theology degree anywhere in NI and that QUB’s motivations “are vague, unsubstantiated and strongly disputed by the college”. In response QUB said only that it has now “requested a meeting with Mr Stalford to clary the university’s position”.The proactive response by QUB marks an apparently signicant departure in its transparency on the matter, having refused to answer any News Letter questions since the decision emerged on  December - and having also refused to release the critical report to the college itself.The MLAs added: “Union scores well by any academic benchmarks. Reports from external examiners, Union’s place in league tables, and high student satisfaction are all indicative of the solid education that the college provides and one that any educational institution would be proud of.“It begs the question as to why the University has made this decision. It is even more puzzling considering that a Review of Theology at Queen’s had already taken place in . As a result of that, the College developed a new undergraduate degree programme...however, this was in place no time at all till the University announced another review in July . Why was this the case  What was the catalyst for it  What happened in the weeks leading up to that decision  It seems highly irregular that another review would be initiated before the new curriculum was given time to be evaluated.”They added: “Many people will come to the conclusion that the University would simply prefer not to have any links with the College because it is a Presbyterian college, regardless of the quality of the courses, its teaching or the education its provides. This is despite the fact that QUB is by no means unique, as other Russell Group universities work in partnership with denominational colleges, as do Oxford and Cambridge.”A source close to QUB said: “It could be that QUB has been so quick to seek a meeting with the DUP because the party has traditionally held the university’s purse strings by controlling the Department for the Economy at Stormont.”Meanwhile, two students of UTC have gone public to praise their institution.Just before Christmas, the university has put on hold an arrangement whereby it sends its undergraduates to the college for theological degrees, after a surprise review announced in June.On This Day  Years Ago : Corsican peace deal terms new store owner Belfast Drumbeg trees for sale Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"After the news broke, theology undergraduate Anna Cubitt contacted the News Letter, saying she was “extremely saddened by the University’s decision concerning Union Theological College”. She added: “As a current student I believe that Queens university has completely ignored any positive influences the college has upon the students it comes into contact with. It deals will all types of students, from all walks of le and faith backgrounds, being totally inclusive to all.“As a student with mental health issues I can honestly say that union college has been extremely good to me and encouraged me academically, in order to achieve my best. “It seems to me that the only problem here in the endeavours of liberal students union, which seems to give everyone a voice except the Christian. “By taking this action QUB are in fact not being inclusive to all, certainly least the Christians in attendance. The staff at Union are of the highest calibre and you would be foolish to dismiss them.”Postgraduate UTC student N James O’Neill contacted the News Letter to take issue with “misinformation”.He noted that last month it was reported that an external watchdog had found that academic standards at UTC were “at risk”. However UTC responded that the Quality Assurance Agencyreport only applied to non-degree courses and that the feedback was part of a voluntary process by the college to gain independent accreditation for the courses.Mr O’Neill said he found that the QAA report “has possibly not been interpreted as it ought” by the media.He added: “Standards within the undergraduate programme, which is awarded by QUB and taught by Union, were found to be of satisfactory standard.” The non-degree courses run by the college were “found to lack the paper trail required for their department meetings” but this was “a minor issue” which can be easily improved, he said.“I also find it strange that the college has been accused of not fostering a supportive and open environment. Student satisfaction rates in the college have been found to be far higher that average. The student community is made up of a whole range of backgrounds, including Roman Catholic and atheist. I know that these students feel very much at home there. They feel that they can openly share their beliefs and interact with others. It’s a helpful environment for students to encounter other beliefs. “Overall, I find that the reporting of this situation has been filled with a lot of misinformation.”try catch            ..

N.S.[N.S. means New Style, ie the current Gregorian calendar which was not then formally adopted but used increasingly]The following are precisely the Articles which have been publish’d in Corsica, relating to the Accommodation concluded between the Genoese and Corsicans by the King’s Mediation.I. A general Amnesty, with Repeal of outlawry, and even the Gullies, for all Persons that have incurred those Penalties on Account of the Rebellion, of which no farther Mention shall be made every Person being to be restored to his Effects and Honours, provided he does accept the Amnesty and submit to the Regulation.II. A general Disarming, under Pain of Death of all Persons that shall afterwards be found to have Arms.III. The Taxes, Subsidies and Gabelles that have not been paid during the Revolt, shall be forgiven, and nothing shall be demanded from any Body on that Account any other Right of the Prince shall commence only from the first of October last.IV. The Commissary General of the Island shall not as formerly, have Power to send to the Galleys ex informata Conscientia but shall only cause the Criminal to be taken up, bring him to a Trial, and send it over to Genoa, to the end that it may be there decided, according to the Forms of Justice. V. The Supream Tribunal of Corsica shall be composed of three Foreign Auditors, who are to be neither Corsicans nor Genoese the inferior Judges shall be Corsican, and be allowed to judge without Appeal in all Law Suits, wherein not above the Value of  Livres is depending, whereas they were formerly limited to Causes not exceeding  Livres.VI. Colleges and Schools shall be established for educating Youth the Corsicans shall be raised to the Episcopal Dignity equally with the other Subjects of the Republick, who promises to recommend the Natives to the Pope, when any Bishopricks become vacant in the Island.VII. The Republick shall every Year, during five Years successively, confer Nobility on four Corsican Families, who shall enjoy all the Honours and Prerogatives attached to that Dignity.VIII. For the Future, Murders shall be punished with Death without Remission, and the Republick binds herself not to grant either Reprieve or Asylum for such Crimes.The King and the Emperor are Guaranties for the Execution of these Articles, and the Regulation has been signed by M. Amelot in the King’s Name, and the Prince de Lichtenstein in the Name of his Imperial Majesty.[Corsica was owned by the Republic of Genoa at this time, but for a decade there had been a rebellion by an independence movement. This peace deal, which has in its clauses echoes of peace deals centuries later including the  Belfast Agreement, did not hold. There continued to be horrendous violence on the island, which later achieved independence, before being conquered by France, around the same time that Napoleon was born there in ]HENRY AGNEW, having just opened Shop at the four SugarLoaves in Belfast, lately possess’d by James Young Junior sells several Sorts of Grocery Goods either by Wholesale or Retail as Cheap as any in the Place.Advertisement.THAT there is to be Sold at Drumbeg, by publick Cant to the highest Bidder, on Monday the first Day of January next, exactly at Twelve of the Clock in the Forenoon, fty fine full grown Ash Trees, fit for broad Hoops, Cars, Wheel-Wrights, or any other Uses.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

The alarm was raised by her friends, and they, together with members of the public and a Penarth RNLI volunteer, helped to keep her safe before the leboat was launched.A throw line was used to reach the casualty, and lejackets were obtained from the leboat station.The ywoman was struggling to hold on, and with high spring tides the RNLI crew member entered the water to fit her lejacket and support her, knowing that the leboat crew had been paged and were on their way.The D-class leboat was launched quickly, and brought the casualty and the Penarth crew member safely back to the station.A medical check was carried out on both, and although cold and wet they were deemed fit and well.Jason Dunlop, Penarth RNLI Leboat Operations Manager paid tribute to all those involved: \"With such a high tide, in darkness and in cold water, the casualty could have easily drted out of sight. By hanging on as she did and with the support of everyone involved the rescue was affected quickly and safely.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34453454454.jpg","title":"supporting belfast start ups on the rise","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business The UK’s digital tech sector has attracted more capital than any other European country and Belfast has established itself as a key hub, writes Roisin Byrne, business director, Hays Northern Ireland The  Tech Nation report makes it clear that digital tech makes an essential contribution to our local economy with clusters and start-ups forming primarily around AI , machine learning, cyber security and big data industries. The Belfast start-up community ecosystem is alive and well and has carved out a reputation in the wider tech community for having good access to talent, funding and transport links. It also benefits from great workspaces such as Ormeau Baths, Farset Labs and the Innovation Centre at Catalyst Inc. Indeed, the city is bubbling with entrepreneurial talent as demonstrated by the large number of start-ups which have launched in the last two years. Belfast boasts a disproportionate number of the UK’s high growth firms and it is estimated that the local ecosystem now supports around , jobs. Hays has worked with a number of these start-ups as they have scaled up operations – firms such as Analytics Engines, Uleska and Vox to name a few. As part of our commitment to the sector we’ve also taken space in Ormeau Baths which has become an epicentre for tech meet-ups, hackathons and pitch events. It’s also a campus for early stage and growth stage start-ups to network, share experience and build scalable, globally focussed businesses. In its first year, % of companies based in Ormeau Baths grew their teams and revenues, and raised over £m in venture funding. We’ve also launched a new national initiative called Super Connect delivered by Empact Ventures which aims to help tech start-ups and scale-ups to explore collaboration with large organisations and funding providers through a series of venture labs and pitch days. The initiative brings together corporates, SMEs, angel investors, venture capitalists, grant providers, loan funds and crowdfunding s to explore supporting these start-ups and scale-ups. Details can be found at www.superconnectseries. In an increasingly competitive marketplace Hays sees real value in the innovative ideas start-ups are using to network and build traction and as they scale up to the next stage we are providing material support and employer value branding to help them attract the talent they need.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
