There are big consequences because nobody is OK with what happened. Nobody, nobody, nobody.\u0027 The host claimed that producer Will Packer decided not to remove Smith from the event, \u0027because that would have been another 15-, 20 minute-explanation about why we\u0027re taking the black man out five seconds before they\u0027re about to decide whether he\u0027s won an Oscar or not.\u0027Goldberg did not know that he had been asked to leave, and refused to go. Marshall Herskovitz, president emeritus of the Producers Guild of America, was among the first to condemn Smith, tweeting shortly after the attack that Smith had \u0027disgraced our entire community\u0027. He said: \u0027I call upon the Academy, of which I am a member, to take disciplinary action against Will Smith.

Energy company Octopus has confirmed that with the £5,000 grant, it will offer heat pumps at a similar price to gas boilers - meaning they could cost as little as £3,000 to install.All heating technologies - including gas boilers - work more efficiently and save homeowners money if their home is well insulated - with improving insulation to save energy being a key part of cutting emissions from buildings. This is something that the campaign group Insulate Britain focused its demonstrations on last year.A recent Government study found all homes in the UK, from Victorian mid-terraces to 1960s blocks of flats, are suitable for heat pumps. But energy experts estimate that only about a fifth of homes, some 4.8million, are suitable for a heat pump today. Another 30 per cent, or 8.4million, need minimal changes such as loft and cavity wall insulation, which they say will also cut bills.Homeowners have also been advised that because radiators on heat pumps operate at a lower temperature than with gas, they might need to swap a few of the oldest single panel radiators to ensure they are big enough to heat the room sufficiently. These can normally be replaced with double or triple panelled radiators that fit in the same spot.Underfloor heating works well with heat pumps because it operates at a lower temperature than radiators, so this will continue to work in homes that have the system - but it is not necessary to install it. Boris Johnson acknowledged earlier this week that people are \u0027anxious at the moment about putting in ground source, or air source, heat pumps to heat their homes\u0027. While the Prime Minister said on Wednesday that he believed costs will come down very fast, he has also pointed to hydrogen as an alternative way of heating homes. The gas could be put through the gas pipe network to heat homes with new boilers that can use hydrogen instead of fossil gas. He said: \u0027People are anxious at the moment about putting in ground source, or air source, heat pumps to heat their homes. Everybody\u0027s worried about having to replace their boilers at vast expense.\u0027For some people that will be the right solution, I think the price of those things will come down very fast as more are made. But you\u0027ve also got a look at the possibility of going back to where you were actually in the 60s and 70s when town gas contain a lot of hydrogen. And you could put a lot more hydrogen into the pipes.\u0027The Prime Minister also said that the \u0027ambition to keep going on the path to net zero\u0027 has \u0027not been adulterated or lost at all\u0027.Speaking to MPs on Wednesday, he also threw his weight behind offshore wind in the drive to produce more electricity in the UK.The energy strategy promised by the Prime Minister has been delayed amid reports of Cabinet infighting, including a row over ending the effective moratorium on onshore wind farms.The Prime Minister told MPs that he believed offshore wind had \u0027massive potential\u0027 but made no mention of turbines located inland. He also stressed the need for new nuclear development, including smaller modular reactors.The strategy was promised by Mr Johnson in response to the turmoil in global energy markets caused by Vladimir Putin\u0027s invasion of Ukraine and is aimed at addressing long-term failures to secure domestic production. But while it was expected in March, the plan has been repeatedly pushed back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a299c3f1ad4bab04db3211e4a4335fc854b8ce0/43_0_4318_2592/master/4318.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=99aa1f743d024ebee150dbe30f3f0a1f","title":"world cup 2022 draw qatar weekend football news live","story":"“Mind you, everyone here in Canada looked at the draw and started thinking “... you know, if we can squeeze a point out of one of the rapidly-aging Euro outfits there’s a chance....”And then comes a puff video for Qatar, images of kids playing football and the like. “Qatar is ready for game,” it says, voiced by a woman with a Scottish twang. “Our hearts meet in sheer delights...the glory of ersity.

Photograph: iStockA language teacher has admitted to fraudulently creating documents about his qualifications with the aim of securing a second level teaching post in Ireland. A fitness to teach inquiry on Friday heard that the teacher, who cannot be named for legal reasons, left his trainee teaching post in the UK prior to completing an induction period needed to become fully qualified.After returning to Ireland in early 2020, he received an offer of a teaching post in a secondary school the following September on condition that he became registered with the Teaching Council. However, he said he was told by the council that he needed to complete his induction period in order to be registered.The teacher admitted to providing a fraudulent certificate from the UK’s Teaching Regulation Agency indicating that he had completed his induction. The correspondence included a section which was supposed to be filled out by the principal of his former school, and included a stamp purporting to be from the school. The teacher admitted to filling this out himself and falsifying the document.‘Scam’When the teacher’s qualifications were later queried, the inquiry heard, he attempted to cover-up his actions by falsely claiming that he had fallen foul of a “scam” and had been defrauded by an official of the agency.Shortly afterwards, he made a complaint to the Ombudsman, claiming that his application to be placed on the Teaching Council register amounted to “clumsy discrimination”, and repeated the claim he had been scammed.However, the teacher, who was present for the inquiry hearing on Friday, later admitted to the Teaching Council that he had falsified details of his qualifications and was “deeply ashamed” of his actions.“I am truly sorry for all the harm caused by my actions,” he said. “I cannot express enough how deeply ashamed I am of my actions, which are deeply out of character for me.”The teacher told the inquiry he suffered from anxiety and depression and had felt under acute pressure to support his family in Ireland.He said he became increasingly anxious and stressed when he realised he could miss out on a secure teaching post due to his qualifications, and that his anti-depressant medication hampered his ability to think clearly.“Falsifying the documents was a stupid and dishonest move.., I am deeply ashamed of my actions…It was at a low point in my life. I made one mistake, and I will never make it again,” he said.DedicationSeveral character references were produced from schools where he previously worked. They praised his dedication and care towards students.However, the principal of the UK school where the teacher did not complete his induction said he had some concerns over his classroom management.The teacher went on to complete his induction at an Irish school under a rule introduced during the Covid-19 crisis aimed at recognising the qualifications of teachers who qualified abroad.Hugh McDowell BL, who appeared for the director of the Teaching Council, told the inquiry that the teacher’s actions amounted to professional misconduct and were a breach of the teachers’ code of conduct.He said the teacher had “failed to uphold the standards of the profession” and that his conduct was “fundamentally lacking in integrity, honesty and values which the Teaching Council seeks to promulgate among its members.”The Teaching Council’s three-person disciplinary committee inquiry panel - chaired by Charlie Dolan and teachers Kathleen Burke and Noel Cronin - adjourned on Friday evening to continue its deliberations. It is anticipated that it will issue a report by April 13th.Where a finding are made against a registered teacher, the Teaching Council’s disciplinary committee panel may apply no sanction, admonish or censure the teacher, or apply conditions to the teacher’s registration. It may also suspend or remove the teacher from the register."},{"url":null,"title":"arrive at busy dublin airport with time to spare cautions varadkar","story":"Checking in at Terminal 1, Dublin Airport. Passengers are allowing more time to make their flights due to delays at security. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Dublin Airport will be “very busy for the next couple of weekends, particularly the Easter weekend”, said Tánaiste Leo Varadkar on Friday. Mr Varadkar advised people to turn up two hours in advance if flying within Europe and three hours if flying long haul. “The airport is seeing traffic volumes 30 per cent higher than they anticipated and they’re short of about 300 staff members and also because of regulatory issues the number of bags they have to check has been increased. So there’s a number of factors at play here,” he said.The airport is “working to hire more staff, get them trained and cleared very quickly, looking for some flexibility from the European Commission particularly when queues get long”.At Terminal 1 on Friday afternoon, Mark Farnan was flying with friends to Birmingham, and from there on to Liverpool to see a football match.He arrived at 2pm though his flight was not due to take off until 5pm. Farnan travels “every second or third week to go to matches” and usually only arrives within an hour or less to get through the airport but it has been “much busier recently”, he said.“My daughter was here yesterday and said it was bedlam, she said it took her over an hour just to get through the fast track. It’s not as bad today, I was here a couple of weeks ago and I had to ask if I could jump the queue to go through because I would have missed my flight,” said Farnan.Brothers Ryan and Glen Garbutt also arrived three hours before their flight to Berlin. “I’ve missed flights before and had to pay for new ones but that’s because I wouldn’t normally arrive early. I’d normally be here a half hour before. But you’re better safe than sorry,” said Ryan Garbutt. ‘We came early’Megan Duggan and partner Bernard were going to Rome with their two children. The family would go on “a lot of city breaks” throughout the year “but usually come last minute. We read about the queues . . . so we came earlier,” said Duggan.Viktoria Kulikova said the queues were “much longer” in December at Dublin Airport compared to Friday afternoon. Kulikova was going on a three-week trip to Latvia, Estonia and Sweden with her husband and daughter. “I was worried about missing my flight . . . but it’s not too bad today,” she said.Earlier this week, Ryanair and several other Irish airlines called on the Department of Transport to have an early meeting of the National Air Transport Facilitation Committee to urgently address the situation and provide solutions to the security queues at Dublin Airport.Ryanair believes long queues will occur again this weekend and over next week’s Easter school holidays. The airline said it was “deeply disappointed” that the Department rejected the request to hold an urgent committee meeting.“Ryanair and other Dublin Airport customers cannot endure more weekends where thousands of customers suffer queue delays of one or two hours, causing many to miss their scheduled flights. The Department of Transport must take responsibility for helping the Dublin Airport Authority to solve this short-term staffing problem.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"taoiseach didn t think twice about travelling to derry after belfast security alert","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin speaking at the Playhouse Theatre in Derry. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireTaoiseach Micheál Martin has said he “didn’t think twice” about attending an event in Derry a week on from a bomb hoax aimed at Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney in Belfast. However, Mr Martin declined to be drawn on whether security measures have been stepped up since a security alert meant Mr Coveney had to stop delivery a speech at a peace building event in north Belfast.Speaking to media following a planned visit to Ulster University Magee Campus in Derry, Mr Martin said security issues were a “matter for members of the PSNI and An Garda Síochána”. He condemned last Friday’s attack on the Houben Centre on the Crumlin Road in Belfast, which police linked to the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).Mr Martin praised the electrician who had his van hijacked and was forced to drive what he believed was a live bomb and leave it outside the event, organised by the John \u0026amp Pat Hume Foundation.“The violence that was imposed on that gentleman, to be forced at gunpoint to make that harrowing journey, the vast majority of people on this island, who are respectful of political views, would abhor such an act,” Mr Martin said.“We thought those actions were consigned to history.“I was heartened by the cross-community unity in the condemnation of that incident.“We should never be afraid of discourse, of dialogue, and in many ways the John \u0026amp Pat Hume Foundation is remembering a man and woman, who above and beyond anything else, championed the virtue of dialogue and the need to keep talking.”Asked about his personal security risk in coming to Derry in the aftermath of the Belfast incident, Mr Martin replied he “didn’t think twice” about attending.Addressing concerns about a threatened escalation in violence by loyalists opposed to the Northern Ireland protocol, he said he has “engaged with all perspectives in Northern Ireland, irrespective of people’s position”, including a meeting with the Orange Order six weeks ago.Many unionists and loyalists argue the protocol, which has effectively created a post-Brexit border in the Irish Sea, is damaging the North’s economy and has undermined its constitutional position as part of the UK.“I will continue to meet everyone in a spirit of co-operation, and endeavouring to have greater harmony and progress,” Mr Martin said.“Democracy must always triumph, we will always take advice from the PSNI and An Garda Síochána, and societies must have the freedom to engage, to discuss, and to reflect and that is critically.“We know at a much larger scale what can happen.“We have a war in Ukraine that has stemmed from authoritarianism versus democracy, stems from a fear of democracy and a fear of dialogues, that is what Russia is at.”Turning to a future financial package to tackle the cost-of-living crisis, Mr Martin said the Government had already allocated two billion since October’s budget to alleviate pressures and it will “be working with all of the stakeholders in terms of navigating a way forward”.Different sectors, including hauliers, farming and agriculture, had already been examined.“Therefore that’s how we intend to approach this but what we are witnessing now is the impact of this war on Ukraine which has exasperated very significantly the ongoing issues we were having already,” he said.“What I said yesterday is that we cannot deal with this on a week-to-week basis, we have to look at this over the medium term, in terms of the Government’s approach to this.“It is a huge imposition on households and on business, and input costs are rising and it is having an effect on the economy, in terms of rising inflation and then in terms of how we see the situation from now until the end of the year.”On Thursday, the Taoiseach and Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan both indicated further measures would be considered, while three other Cabinet Ministers told The  more Government intervention would be necessary as energy and food prices soar.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"on the refugee bus to ireland i m going so i can save my children s lives","story":"12 Paddywagon Tour drivers volunteered to drive five busloads of refugees across Europe to Ireland.

a development that may finally explain why some people develop certain traits and are at greater risk of disease.The size of the missing chunk is so large that scientists say it is the equivalent of deciphering a whole new chromosome.“Finishing the human genome sequence was like putting on a new pair of glasses,” said Dr Karen Miga, of the University of California, Santa Cruz.“Now that we can clearly see everything we are one step closer to understanding what it all means.”The 19-year endeavour to complete the picture has involved scientists from all over the world, including Cambridge University and the Wellcome Sanger Institute.Much of the newly decoded material comes from the centre of chromosomes - or centromeres - and the very tips - the telomeres - both of which are linked to cell ision and the development of cancer and degenerative diseases.The team discovered more than 100 new genes that produce proteins, the molecules which do most of the work in cells and that are required for the structure, function, and regulation of tissues and organs.However, they also found mysterious pockets of non-coding DNA that do not make proteins but still seem to play an important role in cellular functions and may lie at the heart of conditions in which cell ision runs amok, such as cancer.“We are finally digging into what we once called junk DNA, because we could not understand it or look at it accurately,” said Dr Giulio Formenti of the Rockefeller University, New York.“We now know that many diseases are linked to structural repeats in the centromere, and now that these sequences are no longer missing from the human reference genome we can begin to map the origins of these diseases.”To complete the genome, scientists used DNA from a non-cancerous tumour called a hydatidiform mole, which occurs when a human embryo rejects DNA from the mother and instead duplicates DNA from the father.This mistake in fertilisation means the tumour has DNA from just one inidual, making it easier to sequence. This, coupled with advances in genetic sequencing over the past two decades, allowed researchers to fill in the gaps.“You would think that, with 92 per cent of the genome completed long ago another eight per cent wouldn’t contribute much,” said Prof Erich Jarvis of Rockefeller.“But from that missing eight per cent, we’re now gaining an entirely new understanding of how cells ide, allowing us to study a number of diseases we had not been able to get at before.”The breakthrough could also help unpick the origins of humanity. Some of the genes that were missing in the original genome are now thought to be critically important in driving the bigger, more connected brains which separate humans from apes.Researchers also found that the centromeres contained layers of older sequences which appear to be no longer used by the cell but may hold clues to how our DNA worked in the past.“It\u0027s almost like layers of fossils,” said Dr Nicolas Altemose, of University of California, Berkeley.“As you move away from the site of the active centromere you get more and more degraded, to the point where if you go out to the furthest shores of this sea of repetitive sequences you start to see the ancient centromere.”He added: “Before, we just had the blurriest picture of what was there, and now it\u0027s crystal clear.”The research, by members of the Telomere-to-Telomere consortium, was published in six papers in the journal Science.More from NewsThousands more turbines to be built to treble onshore wind powerUkraine has inspired the West by example to relearn the lessons of Thatcher and ReaganRussia-Ukraine latest news: White House sends protective equipment for chemical weapon attack‘Partygate’ fines handed to attendees of Downing Street private secretary’s leaving doGermany hits back at Britain over claim it is ‘over-eager’ for early peace dealWales and Scotland to offer flu jabs to all over-50s but England backtracksMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jonathan van tam having sleepless nights spring covid booster","story":"Jonathan Van-Tam said he is having sleepless nights worrying about over-75s coming forward for their spring booster jabs on his final appearance as England\u0027s Deputy Chief Medical Officer.Prof Van-Tam, who became one of most familiar faces of the Covid pandemic, announced in January that he would be resigning.Speaking at the Royal Society of Medicine\u0027s Covid conference on Thursday, his last appearance in the role, he said he was optimistic that countries were better prepared to respond to future pandemicsBut he warned: I wouldn\u0027t want anybody to take away from our discussion … the idea that this is over, because case rates here in the UK are really, really high and hospitalisations in London, for example, are becoming exceptionally high again.And what keeps me awake at night is whether the people we have called, over-75s, for their second booster dose are going to come forward really rapidly in the next few days and weeks, because it\u0027s going to be important.His comments come after Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u0027s Chief Scientific Adviser, said four-monthly boosters cannot continue and that it was likely the NHS would move to an annual jab programme.The latest official figures show 15,632 people in England were in hospital with Covid as of Wednesday, up 18 per cent week-on-week and the highest since Jan 19 when the number was 15,742.Average daily hospital admissions in England of people with Covid currently stand at 2,050 – the highest since Feb 5, 2021.

Guests were treated to a “greatest hits” package of Laura K’s toughest questions, notably a corker to Donald Trump from a January 2017 press conference in the White House, when the then-prime minister Theresa May called her for a question.Kuenssberg listed Trump’s previous dubious claims about torture, abortion and Russia, and a ban on Muslims coming to the US, before she asked him: “For many people in Britain, those sound like alarming beliefs. What do you say to our viewers at home who are worried about some of your views and worried about you becoming the leader of the free world?”A shocked Trump turned to May. “This was your choice of a question? There goes that relationship.”Ed Balls has moved onwards and upwards since being unceremoniously thrown out of Parliament by voters at the 2015 general election. But at a fundraiser for the National Theatre, he said his “one regret” was rejecting a role in the musical Grease after appearing on Strictly Come Dancing in 2016.“I got asked whether I would like to play Teen Angel in the touring show Grease,” he tells me. Balls turned it down and the part went to 1970s singing sensation Jimmy Osmond. “It is one of the high points of my life to think me and Jimmy Osmond were competing for the same gig,” he tells me proudly.Before the culture wars were invented, liberal minded Joan Bakewell and conservative campaigner Mary Whitehouse would regularly clash over morals and standards on television in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, Bakewell has lost none of her fire, describing this week how she found Whitehouse – who is the subject of a new documentary – to be “a prudish, narrow-minded campaigner”. But Bakewell added a footnote. “Nevertheless, I visited her when she was dying. We made up.” Perhaps a lesson for today’s keyboard warriors.Boris Johnson has clearly not given up on persuading Christian Wakeford to return to the fold. The former Tory MP crossed the floor of the Commons to become a Labour MP at the height of the Partygate controversy.“I think CCHQ has a malfunction with its email because I got an email the other day asking me to join the Conservative Party,” Wakeford tells me. “I am probably now the last person they want to join ... Imagine if I’d replied and said yes? Imagine indeed.

They were wrong.”Yet Marina remains remarkably upbeat as she chats about her past, present and future, showing the strength of character that has got her this far, and which she still believes will see her facing Putin in the International Criminal Court one day.Her biggest ambition in life is “to live longer than Putin, and one day see him tried for war crimes and for the murder of my husband”. The war in Ukraine might even have brought that day closer.For now, though, Marina has a rather more introspective mission at hand. She and her son Anatoly are about to begin work on a joint memoir about Alexander, about his murder, and about the international criminal investigation that has dominated their lives ever since.Anatoly was just 12 when his dissident father died, and Marina believes the process of writing a book together will not only help them to relive cherished memories of Alexander, but also confront unresolved, unspoken elements of their grief.“Anatoly was definitely traumatised by his father’s death,” she says of the boy who was taken to see Alexander as he lay dying in University College Hospital, “but he was very protective of what he was feeling inside. He didn’t cry, and it was only when he got older that he started to talk about it.“When we write this memoir together it will be interesting to hear maybe for the first time his feelings about what happened, from his perspective.”Anatoly, now 28, still lives with his mother in their small flat in West London. He has been working as a paralegal but has decided his future lies in IT and is about to embark on a course in computer coding.Marina and her son talk about Alexander – or Sasha, to use the Russian diminutive form – “a lot” and she has always tried to impress on him the fact that “yes, your father died, but in some way he is with us”.Keeping Alexander’s memory alive, of course, has been a highly public affair for Marina, but not one which came easily.“I’m a very private person,” she says, “and I’m always really surprised when people recognise me in the street, though they are always very polite and generous.“What I do in public, I am doing for my husband, but it doesn’t come naturally. When he was lying in that hospital bed I refused to do any interviews. Sasha said I should do them, and tell people what was happening, but I thought he was going to recover so I never thought I would need to.”Before his death at the age of 44, Litvinenko dictated a statement to be read after his passing, in which he said: “You may succeed in silencing one man, but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life. May God forgive you for what you have done, not only to me but to beloved Russia and its people.” Putin’s blood-curdling reaction to Alexander’s death was to say: “The people that have done this are not God, and Mr Litvinenko is, unfortunately, not Lazarus.”A public inquiry chaired by Sir Robert Owen concluded in 2016 that Litvinenko had been the victim of a Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly KGB) assassination “probably” approved by Putin.It named two Russian agents, Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitri Kovtun, as his killers they had slipped a lethal dose of the radioactive substance polonium 210 into a pot of tea drunk by Litvinenko when they held a meeting with him on Wednesday, November 1, 2006 at London’s Millennium Hotel.Litvinenko told Marina that as he sipped his tea, “in one second he realised something wasn’t right”.Twenty-two days later, he was dead and she believes that if he had finished the cup he might have died very quickly, meaning the cause of his death might never have been detected.Two days after the meeting, he was admitted to Barnet General Hospital, before being transferred to University College Hospital on November 17 when his condition worsened. Doctors diagnosed acute radiation syndrome, and on November 23, after losing consciousness, he suffered a cardiac arrest and died after attempts to resuscitate him failed.And so he became the key witness in the investigation into his own murder. The public inquiry was a personal triumph for Marina, who had spent an entire decade pushing for it, despite the obvious risks to her own safety from taking on Putin and his hitmen.I ask if she feels she has to spend her life looking over her shoulder, but she says she has never had bodyguards and refuses to allow security concerns to constrain her.“In 2006 I was given close communication with the police, which meant I could always contact someone 24 hours a day, and I still have that access, but I don’t really need it,” she says.“I do pay attention to what happens around me – if I see the same person cropping up too many times I might want to know why.”Later this year a four-part ITV series, starring David Tennant as Litvinenko, will dramatise the murder and Marina’s fight for justice, which she hopes will bring the story to a new audience too young to remember the scarcely believable events of November 2006.Anatoly acted as a consultant for the series, but contractual obligations elsewhere meant she could not be involved in the production. Did she meet Tennant? She blushes and smiles, which gives away the answer, even though the official version is that they have never met.Marina, who will soon celebrate her 60th birthday, retains the unmistakable poise of her former life as a ballroom dancer (she still teaches dance), and sits straight-backed on the edge of a sofa as she sips green tea at a hotel near her west London home.]She recalls her first meeting with Alexander, in 1993, when he was working for the FSB investigating organised crime – she was 31 and he was 30.“I had heard about him before I met him,” she says, “and I was really quite surprised when this very young man arrived, looking quite shy. He certainly wasn’t what you expect a KGB man to be!”She was meeting friends for drinks on her birthday (“I always joked afterwards that he was my birthday present,” she says) and Alexander accompanied a friend of hers who was nervous about her safety because of her involvement in a case he was investigating.“Sasha gave you so much confidence. He supported you, he protected you, you felt very confident around him, whether you were his wife, his friend or his child. I never thought I could feel so loved, so protected and so happy.“He was always very open-minded, open to anything new. I never thought I would find all of those qualities in one person.”She also, of course, remembers the last time they spoke, and tears prick her eyes as she recalls leaving his hospital bedside to go home to Anatoly for the night.“I told him: ‘Don’t worry, I’ll be back soon’,” she says. “He said: ‘I love you so much’, and he looked so sad. I tried to make a joke by saying ‘finally you tell me!’, but it was the last thing he said to me. Two hours later he was unconscious.”Campaigning for justice can be lonely work, and Marina does not rule out marrying again one day, saying the idea of having another relationship “isn’t a problem to me”, but that any suitor would have to realise that “Sasha will always be in my life, so it would have to be a strong personality to accept that because most people want to be the only one”.At the start of our interview, before bombarding her with questions about her husband, about Ukraine, about Putin, about Roman Abramovich and so much more, I ask her if there are any particular messages she wants to get across, and her answer comes as a surprise.“Firstly, I’m worried about Russophobia,” she says, without pausing for thought. “Of course I support sanctions against Russia, but now people don’t even want to play Russian music, they want to boycott Russian composers. It’s stupid. The past 100 years have not been good for Russia, but it is also the country that produced Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev.”She accepts that it might seem odd to some people that she is so passionate about defending the country that murdered her husband, but she believes that “there may be a chance for Russia to become a different country” in future.Could she ever see herself going back to a Putin-free Russia if a modern-day Gorbachev were to take over one day and bring about a new glasnost?“When I left Russia I didn’t think I had left forever,” she says, recalling the couple’s arrival in the UK as political refugees in 2000. “There were people who left during the Cold War that knew they were leaving for good, but for me I thought it was going to be temporary.“Now, though, I would be more happy to go to live in Ukraine. It’s a very similar culture I have friends there and there will be plenty of work to do in rebuilding the country once the war is over.”She praises British people for being so “welcoming and open” to taking in Ukrainian refugees, but warns that “they need to be serious about it. “It’s not just about being generous it’s about being capable of supporting people who are traumatised, who have just come from a war zone. People also need to be prepared to be in this for the long haul you can’t just reject someone after a couple of weeks.”She does not have space in the small flat she shares with her son to be able to house a refugee, but is acting as a liaison for others who want to open their homes. She admits the war took her by surprise – a few days before the invasion, Moscow-born Marina was in Ukraine visiting friends in the south-west of the country.“I didn’t think there was going to be an invasion at all,” she admits, “or certainly nothing beyond the Donbas region. There were so many reasons for Putin not to do it, especially the effect that sanctions would have, that I thought he would hold back.”She says the West has been guilty of a collective failure to see Putin for what he is – “someone who has turned Russia into a mafia state and then a terrorist state” – because successive leaders have convinced themselves they knew how to handle him.“During the Cold War it was simple, because the West didn’t really have any personal relationships with Russia,” she says. “But after glasnost the West started doing business with Russia, private companies got deeply involved, personal relationships formed and they wanted to give Putin the benefit of the doubt.”She recalled George W Bush’s meeting with Putin in June 2001, when the US president said he had “looked the man in the eye” and found him to be “straightforward and trustworthy… I was able to get a sense of his soul”.“No-one believed the president of Russia was a real monster,” she says, “but he is and my husband Sasha tried to show it before his death, and he tried to show it through his death.“Russia carried out an act of nuclear terrorism on British soil by murdering Sasha, and it should have been a watershed moment, but it wasn’t.“In 2010 the new government of the UK gave Russia another chance to build its relationship, and more money came in, big donors with Russian surnames gave money to the Conservative Party. It was a big mistake.”She fears the West will become “fatigued” with the situation in Ukraine, and that President Volodymyr Zelensky will accept a peace deal that would be too advantageous to Russia.“It might suit western leaders to push Zelensky into agreeing everything Putin wants so that they can move on, but the Ukrainian people would not accept that, so it won’t be over.”She even suggests that Zelensky’s position as president could be in doubt if he is too accommodating, despite his Churchillian popularity at present.It is Marina’s misfortune that she knows more about Russia’s use of poisons than almost anyone else in the UK, so what does she believe happened to Abramovich, who claims he was poisoned while acting as a go-between in peace talks?“I believe this is all part of a propaganda exercise to frame Ukraine,” she says. “The Russians have already tried to suggest that Ukraine has chemical weapons so that they can stage false flag operations if they want to, and I think Russia will tell its people that Ukraine has tried to poison Abramovich.She believes that ultimately, Putin’s miscalculation in invading Ukraine could have profound consequences for him. “Russia could break up it’s such a huge country that it’s a nightmare to govern, as history has shown.”As for the war, she is concerned that Putin could use battlefield nuclear weapons, but thinks he would not risk all-out nuclear war because “he doesn’t look like a kamikaze he likes his money and his yachts too much”.Even if Putin were to give the order to use tactical nuclear weapons, Marina still has enough faith in the country of her birth to believe his soldiers would refuse to carry out their orders.“My husband refused to carry out orders to kill people,” she says. “I still believe Russia has heroes.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: White House sends protective equipment for chemical weapon attack‘Partygate’ fines handed to attendees of Downing Street private secretary’s leaving doGermany hits back at Britain over claim it is ‘over-eager’ for early peace dealWales and Scotland to offer flu jabs to all over-50s but England backtracksNadhim Zahawi: Children aren’t snowflakes, so let them read books with the ‘N-word’Banks ‘boost their profits’ as they deny savers billions of pounds in interestMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cost of living rises 2022","story":" cost of living blows hitting you from TODAY that pathetic Tories havent fixedFrom energy bills and council tax to National Insurance, bills for tens of millions of Brits are skyrocketing from today.

Energy bills are soaring by around % today National Insurance is going up on Wednesday and inflation is soaring.Chancellor Rishi Sunak last week unveiled cuts to fuel duty and tweaks to National Insurance in his Spring Statement - but neither will help the poorest part-time workers who donapost have a car. And he unveiled just £m of extra support for benefit claimants in distress, at the same time as inflation wipes out £bn of benefitsapos value this year. Labour leader Keir Starmer said today: The Government really needed to step up in its Spring Statement last week.They failed to do so and their response is frankly pathetic on a very, very dficult day for millions of people.  Energy bills are going up far more than weaposve ever seen on record. People are really struggling and I just donapost think the Government gets it. Policing Minister Kit Malthouse today insisted Chancellor Rishi Sunak could act again, but warned the UK had “huge debt” and it would only happen “ the economy allows”. He said: “He is monitoring it on a daily basis,he needs to move further in the future,the economy allows us to do that, don’t forget we’re carrying huge debts at the moment, then I know he’ll look very seriously at doing so.” Hereaposs a breakdown of some of the biggest bill rises coming that have demanded political intervention. And we look at what intervention -any - was offered to help.Energy bills riseDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:The energy price cap has risen to a record £,-a-year for a typical household. Around million Brits on iable tarfs have been hit with a £ rise to the average annual bill overnight on April .A second hike that could be just as big or even worse is expected on October . WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Rishi Sunak previously announced plans to help, which include people living in bands A to D getting £ discount on their council tax in England, and a £ repayable rebate off energy bills in October.But he announced no new cash help in the Spring Statement - despite speculation he was going to raise the £ or delay the date to start repaying it beyond April . Council tax riseDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Englandaposs average Band D council tax bill has gone up by £ to nearly £, a year. Official figures show the .% hike - despite Tory ministers insisting most rises would be capped at % - will bring Englandaposs average bill for a Band D home to £,.Now of course, most people’s council tax will be lower than last year due to the £ discount for Band A-D homes in England. But there are two big catches. First, that £ is meant to pay for energy bills - not absorbing the cost of a tax rise. In Rutland a Band D bill will go up by £, wiping out much of the £ discount. Second, the £ is a one-off. Next Spring, you’ll suddenly feel the force of not just this year’s rise but also the April  rise at the same time.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor announced no changes to the council tax bills and no increase to the £. Councils were given another £million to help the hardest-up families via the Household Support Fund - doubling it to £bn. But this is dwarfed by inflation wiping out £bn of the value of benefits. Search for your council tax rise by postcode by following the link below. Real terms cuts to pay - including for NHS and teachersDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Inflation tipped to peak near % means planned rises to public sector wages - which are due every April and backdated - will be wiped out by rising prices.Ministers have already spelt out plans to raise salaries for experienced teachers by only % in  . Health unions have also blasted plans to offer NHS staff in England a “miserly” % hike. The Royal College of Nursing is demanding % above inflation.And civil service organisations can make average pay awards up to just %, with a further % to be targeted at specic priorities. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor announced no extra cash for public sector wage rises. They are already having to be funded out of departmentsapos existing budgets - those did not rise in the Spring Statement.Royal College of Nursing General Secretary Pat Cullen said: “The cost-of-living crisis means some are having to choose between filling up their cars and feeding their children. [Spring Statement] fuel measures are not enough to stop nursing staff subsidising the NHS when they fill up their car.  VAT s to % in pubs and restaurantsDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:From today VAT s to % in pubs and restaurants, and other hospitality venues - inevitably raising the prices for punters while inflation is already raging.The VAT rate had been cut due to the Covid pandemic and despite the cost of living squeeze, itaposs ing to the full rate as planned. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED: Rishi Sunak announced nothing to stop the VAT hike. UKHospitality Chief Executive Kate Nicholls said: “Locking in VAT at .% would have given hospitality businesses a major boost, and helped the sector in its ambition to lead the UK back to post-Covid prosperity.As it is, thousands of jobs could be lost, the UK will remain uncompetitive versus international rivals, and already hard-pressed consumers in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis will see price rises in their favourite pubs, bars and restaurants, further fuelling inflation. A real-terms cut to Universal Credit housing supportDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:At the start of the Covid pandemic, aposLocal Housing Allowanceapos - the amount of Universal Credit you get to cover your rent - was raised to match the cheapest % of rents in your local area.But this has been frozen in cash terms since then and has been frozen again for a year from April . The National Residential Landlords Association said the freeze while inflation soars was simply absurd and will exacerbate the already serious cost-of-living crisis.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:No change.A real-terms cut to childcare helpDATE: NOW WHATaposS HAPPENING:Poor parents will be hit hard by this monthaposs cost-of-living crisis as Tory ministers refuse to raise a crucial childcare allowance - despite soaring inflation.Parents on Universal Credit can claim back % of childcare costs, but only up to a £.-a-month cap - which has not changed since  and is not rising in April.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:You now the message by now - there was no change to this. Nor was there help for the childcare sector or schools more generally, beyond what was announced in the Autumn.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “Like every household and business, schools are facing crippling rises in energy costs, to be funded from already stretched budgets.” InflationDATE: NOW WHATaposS HAPPENING:UK CPI inflation hit .% in February. The Budget watchdog now says itaposll rocket to an average of .% this year - and could peak at nearly % thanks to the Ukraine-Russia war.That -year high will mean the pound in your pocket buys you less in bread or fuel, and tightens business margins to the point firms could go bust. It means real household disposable income set to fall .% this year - the biggest since records began in .WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor cut fuel duty, raised National Insurance thresholds and increased a Household Support Fund in what the Treasury claimed was £.bn of help. But it wonapost help the poorestand he admitted he canapost stop the tide of inflation. Mr Sunak said: “The OBR have not accounted for the full impacts go the war in Ukraine and we should be prepared for the economy and public finances to worsen - potentially signicantly”.The IFS think tank warned even with everything put together, a middle earner on £, can still expect to be £ worse off this year than last year.  Interest ratesDATE: NOW WHATaposS HAPPENING:Last month the Bank of England increased interest rates to .%, despite warnings it would “crush” households already drowning in the cost of living crisis.The Bank took the move to slow the economy down and cool soaring inflation . Governor Andrew Bailey recently appealed to workers not to ask for big pay rises, as that fuels inflation further. But it will mean new mortgage rates become more expensive, and inflicts an overnight rise to monthly payments for people on standard iable rates. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor had his hands tied on this one as interest rates are decided independently by the Bank of England.There was no new help for homeowners in the Spring Statement, apart from knocking the % VAT off green home improvements like solar , insulation and heat pumps. Meanwhile the Bank rate rise has knocked £bn off the public finances by making borrowing more expensive, wiping out the National Insurance rise in one fell swoop. Petrol pricesDATE: NOW WHATaposS HAPPENING:Petrol prices have hit record highs due to Russia ’s war in Ukraine. The average price of petrol reached .p a litre while diesel rose to .p a litre Sunday before last.A month earlier they averaged .p and .p a litre respectively. A family car with a typical -litre tank is now paying £.p to fill up compared to £. a year earlier. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Fuel duty was cut by p a litre in the Spring Statement last week, until March .The Chancellor said it was the biggest cut ever and the Treasury boasted the fuel duty cut, along with a freeze already planned, will save the average van driver around £ this year - or £, for the average haulier. But it will still only knock around £ off a -litre tank for a family car. The Resolution Foundation said it will save the typical driving households £ a year, but evenpassed on in full by garages, it will only reverse % of the increase in pump prices over the past year.  National Insurance riseDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING: A £bn rise in National Insurance will hit working people as the Treasury looks to cut Covid backlogs in the NHS and begin funding social care.Employees will pay .p more in the pound on earnings above the threshold, a rise from % to .%.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Mr Sunak raised the threshold at which workers start paying National Insurance by £, to £, - claiming itaposd save Brits up to £ a year.Of all the cost of living rises facing Brits this is the one Rishi Sunak came closest to sorting out. But this doesnapost factor in a . percentage point rise in the same tax . This will cut into the £ saving, and outstrip it entirely for anyone earning over £, a year.Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves accused Rishi Sunak of “making an historic mistake” by failing to scrap a tax hike on jobs, warning families will “endure signicant hardship”. Officials are also confident that inflation is so high, there will still be more National Insurance coming in overall - despite thresholds being raised.Income tax ‘stealth tax’DATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Rishi Sunak chose to freeze income tax thresholds at a time when inflation is climbing at frightening speed. Youaposll have to carry on paying % on earnings over £,, and % on earnings over £, - just like this year.According to the Commons library, more than a million more people will be paying a higher rate of income tax by . The IFS think tank now warns it’s a £.bn ‘stealth tax’, two and a half times bigger than first thought. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Rishi Sunak announced no changes to the thresholds despite a campaign to do so. The National Insurance thresholds are more generousbut income tax remain frozen.The IFS said as a result, almost all workers will be paying more tax on their earnings in  than they would have been - even when the tax cuts are taken into account. Student loans aposstealth taxaposDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Millions will be forced to pay more on their student loans under what has been branded a “stealth tax rise”. Student loan repayment thresholds will be frozen from April  after plans to raise them by .% were scrapped.The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies warned the freeze will cost £k earners £ a year more than they expected. It gets worse further in the future. Students starting university next year will begin paying off their loans when they earn more than £, - down from the existing £,-a-year threshold. And theof time to repay their debt will be extended to  years, up from . The IFS said this will leave poorer graduates paying £, more over their letimes.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Nothing for the student finance system or graduates repaying loans. Quite the contrary - the small print of Budget forecasts shows the long-term changes to the student loan system will net tens of billions for the Chancellor.It will save the public finances £.bn in   and an average of £.bn a year over the following years.  Massive real-terms cut to welfare benefitsDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Benefits will rise by .%, as little as £. a month on the rate of Universal Credit.Tory MPs pushed through the plans earlier this year - saying it was in line with inflation. But inflation has since doubled to .%. This will severely exacerbate the cost-of-living crisis for those who are struggling the most, with food bank use soaring as food prices in the supermarket rise by a predicted %.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor announced no changes to benefits despite speculation he could tweak work allowances in Universal Credit.His allies claimed he didnapost need to act again after raising work allowances and cutting the taper rate in the last Budget. But these measures only help people in work - as do most of the measures announced last week, too. Once again, those who cannot work due to sickness or other reasons are left behind. Pensions are being cut in real terms - before rising next yearDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Pensions could rise by more than % next April after the Tory DWP chief promised to bring back the triple lock - despite soaring inflation.Therese Coffey suspended the triple lock - a solemn manesto pledge - for one year in   because post-Covid wages were bouncing back in an “anomaly”.That sparked fury as it meant the state pension will rise by only .% next month, less than inflation. That is a real-terms cut of £ to Britain’s million pensioners, Shadow DWP chief Jon Ashworth said.But Ms Coffey said the triple lock wouldin   as promised. That could lead to a rise of .%, experts predict.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Like above, Rishi Sunak announced nothing extra to help pensioners.Kate Henderson, Chief Executive of the National Housing Federation said: “The increase in the household support fund and changes to the National Insurance threshold are welcome, but there will still be many families on the lowest incomes who are very anxious about the cost of living, particularly rising energy bills.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Spring StatementPoliticsCost of Living: Were Here to Help\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Tonight the BBC reports the Indian IT company is now trying to find replacement roles abroad for staff employed in Moscow. Mr Sunak has previously rejected allegations his family has been benefiting from Vladimir Putinaposs regime when pressed about his weaposs stake in Infosys.He told Sky News he had nothing to do with that company and said he had absolutely no idea whether Infosys was following the signicant actions put in place in response to the invasion. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Earlier, Keir Starmer demanded to know whether Mr Sunak’s family was benefiting from cash made in Russia.The Labour leader said: As the Chancelloraposs we is concerned, thereaposs just a fundamental principle, is their household benefiting from money made in Russia when the Government has put in place sanctions  That is in the public interest for us to have an answer to - Iaposm not attacking their family but I do want to knowthe Chancelloraposs household is benefiting from money from a company thataposs investing in Russia when the Government is saying quite rightly that nobody should be doing that.  Earlier this week, Mr Sunak angrily hit out at his we and her family being thrust into the spotlight. “I think itaposs totally fine for people to take shots at me, itaposs fair game - Iaposm the one sitting here and thataposs what I signed up for,” he told BBC Newscast. Itaposs very upsetting and wrong for people to try and come at my we and beyond that actually, with regard to my father-in-law, for whom I have nothing but enormous pride and admiration for everything that heaposs achieved. No amount of attempted smearing is going to make me change that because heaposs wonderful and has achieved a huge amount. “As I said, Iaposm enormously proud. The Chancellor has previously urged business owners to think very carefully about any investments that would in any sense support Putin and his regime as fighting continues across Ukraine. Labour aposs deputy leader Angela Rayner has said Mr Sunakaposs ties to Infosys amount to a conflict of interest, and has demanded Mr Sunak declare his we’s shareholdings in the usual way on the Register of Members’ Interests.She told the Mirror: One minute he is telling British companies to think carefully about investments that in any sense support Putin and his regime - the next we hear his family are making millions from a company operating out of the Russian capital. This company, founded by Sunak’s father-in-law, has been handed millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money in contracts. Rishi Sunak must come clean about whether he is personally benefiting from business in Russia and whether he has declared this conflict of interest to the Permanent Secretary orheaposs been profiting in secret.Despite allegations of hypocrisy, Mr Sunak has insisted he has “followed the ministerial code to the letter” and has previously denied benefitting from doing business in Russia. A spokesperson for the Chancellor told the Mirror Ms Murthy is a minority shareholder in the firm, adding: Neither her nor any member of her family have any involvement in the operational decisions of the company.

Sir Keir said: He told the House no rules were broken in Downing Street during lockdown. The police have now concluded there was widespread criminality. The Ministerial Code says that ministers who knowingly mislead the House should resign. Why is he still here  Boris Johnson scoffed hang on a minute! and accused Keir Starmer of being a human weather vane after the Labour leader stopped short of repeating his call for the PMaposs resignation last week.  The PM said the Met Police - whoaposve warned they could issue more fines beyond the  anonymous ones so far - must “get on with their job” adding: We are going to get on with our job.But Keir Starmer said: There are only two possible explanations.“Either he’s trashing the Ministerial Code, or he’s claiming he was repeatedly lied to by his own advisors and that he didn’t know what was going on in his own house and his own office. “Come off it! “He really does think it’s one rule for him and another rule for everyone  - that he can pass off criminality in his own office and ask others to follow the law.” Labouraposs leader added: When is he going to stop taking the British public for fools  It came after Boris Johnsonaposs deputy today finally admitted  staff broke the law over Covid lockdown parties - after No bizarrely tried to avoid saying they did.Dominic Raab also confirmed ministers like Rishi Sunak will inevitably disclosethey get fined. So far, No has only pledged to name Boris Johnson and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case.Scotland Yard yesterday said it would hand out  fines to people over parties in Downing Street and Whitehall.Yet the PM still appeared to be in denial. Pressed over Mr Johnson’s view, his spokesman said: “It’s for the Met to make that judgment, rather than the Prime Minister.”Today Mr Raab, who is the Justice Secretary and once prosecuted war crimes, accepted the  fined people broke the law saying: Clearly there were breaches of the regulations - that’s the only thing that could warrant the  fixed penalty notices”. Last night Boris Johnson threw a glitzy bash for Tory MPs, hours after the Met confirmed Downing Street lockdown parties had broken the law. The PM hosted around  MPs for dinner at a central London hotel as he attempted to bolster his leadership and draw a line under the Partygate scandal. Politicians were set to dine on salmon tart, chicken thighs and a chocolate praline dessert, washed down with fine wines. Top Tories walked past families who lost loved ones to Covid, who held a candlelit vigil in protest outside Londonaposs Park Plaza hotel and shouted at MPs: Off to another party, are we  One Tory MP, Michael Fabricant, told the waiting media the party would be a lot of fun adding: Itaposs great, we had a photo taken, it was absolutely super. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford blasted: Last night millions of families will have been desperately trying to figure out how they will possibly afford the £ energy price hike that will hit them this Friday. At the very same time, Tory MPs were gathering across the street for a champagne bash in the Park Plaza. We all know the Tories partied during lockdown and now they’re partying through this cost-of-living emergency. Earlier Keir Starmer blasted the PM and “cynical” Chancellor Rishi Sunak for putting the  Tory re-election campaign over and above helping people pay their bills by promising a p income tax cut. The PM insisted he was still a “tax-cutting Conservative” - but Keir Starmer told Mr Johnson to “cut the nonsense and treat the British people with a bit of respect”. He said the Tories were imposing  tax rises, bringing the tax burden to its highest for  years and for every £ taken in tax rises, £ is given back. “Is that cutting taxes or is it raising taxes ” he mocked. Boris Johnson fumed: “I don’t know where he’s been the last two years…. “Even for Captain Hindsight, to obliterate the biggest pandemic for the last century from his memory, to obliterate the £bn we’ve had to spend… is quite extraordinary.” But Keir Starmer said: “I can only hope that his police questionnaire was bit more convincing than that. This year British people face the worst fall in living standards on record. While they are counting every penny, the Prime Minister is hitting them with higher taxes.“But in  when there just so happens to be a general election, they will introduce a small tax cut. That is not taking dficult decisions, itaposs putting the Tory re-election campaign over and above helping people pay their bills. How did he find a Chancellor as utterly cynical as he is  Prime Minister Boris Johnson replied: What we have is a Chancellor who took the tough decisions to look after the UK economy throughout the pandemic, who protected people up and down the land with £ billion worth of support. And by the way,we had listened to them,we had listened to Captain Hindsight, we would not have come out of lockdown in July last year. We would have stayed in lockdown over Christmas and New Year, with the result that the UK economy would not be growing in the way that it is. And so we would not be able to make the investments that we now are and under Labour we would have to tax more and borrow more and they cannot be trusted with the economy.

But the plans have already been criticised, with unions saying ministers have not gone far enough and the British Ports Association pointing out ports cannot enforce wage rules. Mr Shapps also outlined plans to close minimum wage loopholes and clampdown on fire and rehire practices. He will ask the Insolvency Service to consider disqualying PO chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite from acting as a company director, after the boss brazenly admitted to MPs the firm broke the law by not consulting with unions or notying the government. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “This plan has gaping holes. It won’t deliver a fair outcome for the  sacked workers, and it won’t stop another PO-style scandal.  “Closing the legal loophole which lets companies pay less than the minimum wage is a start, but we need much more from the Government. “Ministers must do everything they can to ensure PO reinstate staff on their previous pay – a union-negotiated rate that is signicantly higher than the national minimum wage. “That means severing all ties with DP World, including lucrative freeport contracts. “Andministers really want to stop companies firing at will, they must go further than a feeble statutory code and finally deliver the long-promised Employment Bill to boost worker protections. “Without stronger employment legislation, bad bosses will continue to trample over workers’ rights.”  British Ports Association, Richard Ballantyne, added: While itaposs right the government and the ferry industry look to improve employment rules and standards, the expectation that port authorities will need to enforce minimum wage rules in the shipping sector could be unworkable. This will place ports in a dficult legal predicament, especially before any legislation is in place. DP World-owned PO Ferries sacked its crews and replaced them with agency workers on March . The minimum wage in the UK for people aged  and over is £. per hour. Mr Hebblethwaite, whose basic annual salary is £,, told MPs on March  that the average pay of the agency crew is £. per hour, but insisted this was permitted under international maritime laws. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Shapps said: “Where new laws are needed, we will create them. Where legal loopholes are cynically exploited, we will close them. And where employment rights are too weak, we will strengthen them.” Mr Shapps said HM Revenue  Customs will dedicate “signicant resource” to ensure all UK ferry operators are “compliant with the national minimum wage, no s, no buts”.Employers will be prevented from using “ fire and rehire tactics”they fail to make “reasonable efforts to reach agreement through consultation”, the Transport Secretary said.Mr Shapps added of the proposals: “It’ll send a clear message thatyou are using British waters and British ports to ply your trade then you must accept British laws.” Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh told the Commons that the steps announced by the Government to “insist on the bare minimum cannot come a moment too soon”. PO Ferries has accused the Maritime and Coastguard Agencyof operating with “an unprecedented level of rigour” after it detained two of its ships. European Causeway was held in Larne, Northern Ireland, on Friday, while Pride Of Kent was detained in Dover, Kent, on Monday.  Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, was also unimpressed with the plans, saying: “Despite all the bluster, Grant Shapps has failed to grasp the opportunity to adequately stand up to the banditry behaviour of PO. “The Prime Minister repeatedly said to Parliament that the Government would be taking legal action to save British seafarers’ jobs, but he has failed to keep his word. “This continued lack of action and courage has meant a ferry company owned by the Dubai royal family has been able to break our laws and disrupt our ports and ruin people’s lives with impunity, and we will keep pressing the Government to ensure justice for our members. “What has been announced today is far too little, too late, and we are calling for urgent action for speedier, more radical reforms to save the UK seafarer from oblivion.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Keir Starmer said the government “just doesn’t get” it as Kit Malthouse said his family is finding it “quite tricky... day-to-day”.The North West Hampshire MP made the comment on the same day he receives a £,-a-year pay rise for MPs. Speaking in front of a burning fireplace in his home, the father-of-three told LBC Radio: As you know, Iaposve got children. They need to be fed and that cost is rising. My fuel prices are rising quite signicantly, and I have to say that in my constituency Iaposm on oil central heating still, sadly. He added: We are feeling it very signicantly. MP Neil Coyle, who sits on the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee said: “Malthouse should apologise for his gross insensitivity and focus on helping his constituents and everyone battling budgets rather than talking about himself.”Lib Dem Treasury spokeswoman Christine Jardine said: Just how out of touch are this lot The fact a government minister in the wealthiest % of taxpayers is struggling will ramp up furious pressure on Rishi Sunak to announce more help.Last week the Chancellor made National Insurance thresholds more generous and unveiled a temporary fuel duty cut - but neither will help the worst-paid part time workers with no car as incomes drop by the fastest since records began in the s.  He has already announced a £ council tax discount that not everyone is eligible for, and a £ energy bills discount that only comes in October and must be paid back. Keir Starmer blasted the Government’s “pathetic” response as National Insurance, energy bills, council tax and inflation all soar - with bills expected to jump again on October . Energy firms’ websites crashed yesterday as people submitted meter readings ahead of today’s £ surge in annual bills. Charities said the rise will double the number of ‘fuel stress’ families struggling to pay the gas bill to million. The TUC demanded an emergency budget with general secretary Frances O’Grady saying: “This is a living standards emergency. Last week’s Spring Statement was woefully inadequate.” And parents told Save the Children they would be giving their children shared baths and cold dinners, or even sending them to bed hungry. Bethany Fern, a -year-old single mum to a seven-year-old and three-year-old from Southport, told the charity: “Iaposm going to try and cut back even more on what we spend on food and try to freeze more.“We’ll be eating a lot more cold meals, triple-checking that plugs are turned offnot being used and limiting TV even more than we already do. “We already have the heating off a lot, and my children rely on extra layers, duvets and weighted blankets. “They have to have shared baths or not fresh baths between each other to preserve the boiler from heating water.” Another single mum-of-three, who works full time, told LBC Radio she keeps her kids warm with hot water bottles, can only afford one meal a day and eats their leftovers.Heating oil - used by many rural homes and not subject to the price cap on gas and electric bills - has rocketed in price after Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine and peaked at p a litre last month.Minister and father-of-three Mr Malthouse said: “Lots of people in rural areas are suffering from the oil price rise. So we are feeling it very signicantly.“I have to confess to you, we did convert last year to electric vehicles, so we are feeling the electric price but not through the petrol. So it is a challenge for everybody. Mr Malthouse earns £, as an MP following a .% rise today. Together with his salary as Policing Minister he earns £, a year.He said his family tradition was to have the heating off from April  - but with Britain hit by late Spring snow and ice, he had lit a fire in his fireplace.Mr Malthouse had been asked directly what other “economies” he was having to make in his household. He insisted Chancellor Rishi Sunak could act again, but warned the UK had “huge debt” and it would only happen “ the economy allows”. He said: “He is monitoring it on a daily basis,he needs to move further in the future,the economy allows us to do that, don’t forget we’re carrying huge debts at the moment, then I know he’ll look very seriously at doing so.” Save the Children director Dan Paskins blasted the government’s response - including raising benefits by just .%, half the inflation rate - “isn’t good enough”. He said: “The rise in energy prices will be devastating for families on low incomes. “We’ve already seen families having to choose between heating their homes and feeding their children. “These price rises will undoubtedly leave millions of parents wondering how they will be able to cope in the months ahead. Unless families are provided with more support, this increase in energy bills will leave more children living in cold and damp homes, going to bed hungry, and missing out on the opportunities they need to grow and thrive.” One working single mum who remained anonymous told the charity: “I actually feel physically sick. I feel pressurised to work more hours even when Iaposm already working as much as I can.“I often do more work after my daughter goes to bed to make the most of the time I have without it affecting her.” Labour leader Keir Starmer blasted: I think most people are clear that ... the Government really needed to step up in its Spring Statement last week.“They failed to do so and their response is frankly pathetic on a very, very dficult day for millions of people. “Energy bills are going up far more than weaposve ever seen on record. People are really struggling and I just donapost think the Government gets it.  Government minister Kit Malthouse said: I canapost pretend to you it isnapost tough. It is going to be.” Liverpool-born Mr Malthouse, , is a close ally of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Before entering politics he was a chartered accountant at Deloitte before setting up County Finance Group. As chairman, he trousered £,-a-year for between  and  hours’ work a month, according to the MP’s register of interests. He is believed to have given up the role after becoming a minister in early . He also holds shares in County Finance Group Ltd and County Business Finance Ltd.  He was elected to the ultra-safe Tory seat of North West Hampshire in  and enjoys a , majority. He married Juliana Fahrain  years ago. She is managing director of Kun Europe, which “provides a range of services to The Kun Shoulder Rest, the worldaposs leading shoulder rest for violin and viola”. They have one son and one daughter together. He also has a son from a previous marriage. Labour’s leader urged ministers to examine hiking benefits by the rate of inflation - .% and set to peak at almost % - instead of .% now which is a real-terms cut. As the cost-of-living crisis intensied, the Labour leader said people were “tossing and turning in their beds about how they’re going to pay for this”. He said people are “seeing nothing from the government”, who “don’t realise” how badly people are struggling. He added he was hearing of people keeping the heating at C as they canapost afford any more. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year.

Denise Wallington, from Bedfont in west London, retired from work in  but vowed sheaposd never become a boring nan. After joining her local gym so she could go swimming, Deniseaposs attention was caught by the dance music blaring from an exercise class one day. Since then, sheaposs got herself a gruelling workout routine which sees her in the gym every day for two and a half hours. She said: I was dreading turning  in September , but I donapost feel my age at all. I broke up with someone recently and Iaposm even fitter now Iaposve made the gym the number one love in my le!After quitting work, Denise knew she needed to get active and decided to get herself a gym membership. She recalls feeling tired and lethargic in her younger years, when she didnapost exercise at all. As her confidence in the gym improved, she barely spent a day without going to the gym and made sure she worked out just after doing the school run for her grandchildren Maisie,  and Harry, eight. When I first started, I would come home feeling exhausted, she said. Every muscle ached, but as I progressed, my fitness levels improved and I got better. I would never have believed in  years that I would be so hooked on the gym or that I could be this strong.  Due to suffering with osteoarthritis, she uses a wrist splint when lting weights. After her recent break up, Denise even used the gym as a distraction to help herself feel better - and she claims sheaposs now even happier. Denise said: Working out and staying fit stops things from getting me down. Last summer, Denise dipped her toes into HIIT workouts with FORTIS after being invited to a special VIP session at her gym, Spelthorne Leisure Centre. She now uses battle ropes, slam balls, and press machines during her  minute intense workouts and says sheaposs so much stronger.  Denise said: I get such a buzz in there and I feel so impressed with myself because I see those -something yummy mummies and I can give them a run for their money. The nan has had a lust for live since losing her partner Phil in , when he was just  - making Denise realise le is precious. She said: Phil died very young and very quickly. He became ill in February, was diagnosed in March and died on April . No one could believe it. It knocked everybody for six. When Phil died, it made me take stock of my le and I am quite a confident and strong person as a result. Since becoming fitter than sheaposs ever been, Denise reckons sheaposs a better grandmother.  She said: A little boy said to my grandson Harry at school that he wishes his nan was like me, because she just sits in a chair all day, while Iaposm fun. I was very pleased, as Iaposd be devastatedmy grandchildren just thought I sat there doing nothing. I do lots with them. I took them rowing on the Thames the other day and I take them swimming. She also spends her pension on making sure she looks tip top in the gym and has a wardrobe full of workout gear. Denise said: I have  pairs of trainers now, too, because I like to have ones in dferent colours so I can be colour-coordinated. Every day when she does her workouts, Denise meets up with a group of pals who help keep her young. She said: Iaposve made brilliant friends. As soon as I step in the gym, there is banter with the receptionists, the trainers, the cleaner - everyone. They all think Iaposm mad, but in a nice way. For now, Denise is happy being single and fit - and she urged others not to let their fear of the gym stop them from getting in better shape. She said: Iaposd advise other people in later le not to be daunted by the gym. Give it a go, because itaposs just great.

I feel that Zacaposs needs have now finally been recognised.As a result of the article and the pressure Iaposm putting on them I hope he will be back in school by April .

Progress is definitely being made but I feel itaposs purely because heaposs reached five years old now and the local authority have to prove him with somewhere.

Laura said The Mirroraposs article had helped raise awareness about the struggle parents face when fighting for educational support for children with special needs. She thinks the UKaposs compulsory school age should be lowered to four years old so children cannot be expelled and left at home once they have started education. A Department for Education spokesperson previously said: “Suspensions and permanent exclusions should only be used as a last resort, but we back headteachers to suspend or exclude pupils where it is necessary and helps maintain calm classrooms.“We are consulting on changes to behaviour and exclusions guidance to make sure this is used in a fair way, and the cross-government SEND Review will further consult on how children with special educational needs and disabilities are supported by the system, including in alternative provision.” Local authorities are responsible for arranging full-time education for excluded pupils once they reach compulsory school age. A spokesman for Worcestershire Children First, which provides education support services on behalf of the county council, said: “Our SEN services are currently working closely with the family to secure the most appropriate education provision for Zac.” Worcestershire County Councilaposs cabinet member for education Marcus Hart previously said: “Parent carers have a statutory right to ask for a particular educational setting and support for their child but it can at times be challenging to find the right place that has capacity and can meet a child’s inidual needs.The law requires all children to start full-time education by the beginning of the term following their fth birthday and we are working with Ms Jordan to find a suitable and appropriate school that meets Zac’s assessed needs, ready for him to start school in April.

The Virgin Voyages cruise ship Valiant Lady was making itsto its boarding point in Portsmouth following a tour of Spanish and Portuguese ports on the Atlantic when the passenger went missing on Wednesday night .Crew members launched an urgent search and rescue operation, with the cruise lineraposs captain even asking guests to keep a lookout for any sign of the missing man, the Daily Mail reports.After it was discovered the man had gone into the sea, the ship turned around to search for the man. Despite the combined efforts of those on the ship, a spotter plane, a helicopter, and nearby merchant vessels, the rescue operation was suspended hours later. The passenger, believed to be British, is now feared to have drowned. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereThe Virgin Voyages cruise ship Valiant Lady hosted performances from s pop icons including Tony Hadley, Toyah, T’Pau, Altered Images, ABCaposs Martin Fry and former Radio  DJs Bruno Brookes and Gary Davies. After the search was suspended, the ship resumed its journey to Portsmouth - finally docking  hours later than planned. According to the Mail, further inquiries onboard show the man appeared to deliberately jump over the side of the ship, though no CCTV footage has yet been made available.  Passengers paid up to £, for the cruise - aimed at a demographic of young at heart adults and kitted out with restaurants, bars and a nightclub. But the trip was blighted by several incidents throughout its voyage, including one destination being dropped from the itinerary altogether. At one point, a passenger became gravely ill and had to be air-lted off the ship by helicopter. Passengers have also claimed there were multiple covid infections, leading to staff creating an area for those who had tested positive to isolate in. Another guest said: Everyone among the passengers is devastated by what’s happened - it’s just horrible to think that a fellow passenger has probably died.  A Virgin Voyages spokesman said: In the early hours of the morning, we were informed of a man overboard incident involving a Sailor [passenger], which resulted in a search and rescue mission. Weaposre deeply saddened by this news and our thoughts are with this Sailor’s family and loved ones. Our investigation indicates that this was an intentional act and that no foul play is suspected. A Maritime and Coastguard spokesperson said: Since .am yesterday HM Coastguard was coordinating a search for a man overboard from the Valiant Lady cruise ship in the Bay of Biscay, with the assistance of our counterparts in Spain and France. The French sent a fixed-wing aircraft to provide air support to a helicopter sent by Spain to conduct a search. Two merchant vessels and the cruise ship were also assisting.

Environmental policy consultant Mavourneen Conway, , from Norfolk, UK, and husband Chris first tried their hands at home renovation when they added an extension onto their first house several years ago. With three boys - Ciaran, , Liam, , and Owen,  - the couple decided to find somewhere with more space for them to grow up, so purchased a five-bedroom Georgian farmhouse in March . Rolling up their sleeves, the family got to work on creating their dream home, with most furniture thrted and upcycled.  My husband grew up in a family whereyou could do it yourself, you gave it a go, said Mavourneen. His approach has certainly rubbed off on me. Building the extension to our first house taught us both a lot of skills and gave us a lot of confidence to try things. Our kids have also gotten stuck into lots of our DIY projects so hopefully theyaposll do the same when they grow up.  Iaposve always loved being creative, and DIY has given me a great outlet. Itaposs so satisfying being able to learn something new and make something yourself. With all the information available online, thereaposs a tutorial for pretty much anything which makes it so much easier to try doing things yourself.Mavourneen has developed a love for DIY, and is passionate about finding pieces second hand that she can upcycle. My first DIY project in our new home was turning a coffee table I found second hand into an ottoman, she said. Iaposd never upholstered anything before so that was a learning curve. Now Iaposve got six dining chairs Iaposve found that all need upholstering too. I also did my first bit of DIY art recently and Iaposm excited to do more of that.  Iaposd love to get into carpentry and building things from scratch so Iaposve got a couple of projects that Iaposm thinking about to give that a go. Some of Mavourneenaposs other upcycling projects include giving a makeover to a piano she found for free, which her son is now learning to play, creating a vanity unit from a £ chest of drawers she got second-hand, and creating a lampshade out of an old cat bed. I love our new DIY vanity unit, but our oversized ottoman will always be a special project as it was my first time upholstering anything, said Mavourneen.  Over Christmas I loved doing a DIY hanging wreath, and the boys and I made some oversized outdoor light baubles by using wire flower baskets tied together and wrapped in fairy lights. Iaposm hoping to be able to use them in the garden this year as they had such an impact. With a love for DIY, Mavourneen and her family have been keeping down costs as they renovate the home. The cheapest transformation by far has been the bathroom, which only cost us about £ to do, she said.  There is such a huge list of other priorities, and the fixtures and fittings in the bathroom were generally sound so we had to work around what we had.We made a new vanity unit out of a chest of drawers I found on Facebook marketplace. We used a lot of items we already had and just repurposed them, including the vintage light fittings and the vintage mirror.We found a vintage cast iron radiator second hand for £ which my husband installed.  We also made some peg shelves to go around the bath which cost £, and decided to seal and paint the wooden floorboards to save on flooring. In terms of the other rooms, the new kitchen was the biggest expense, costing £,, as we had to start from scratch. We had to open up and reinstate a fireplace, as well as replace all the units and worktops. However we saved the old units and turned them into a utility room in the cellar. We also kept and repaired the  year old vintage La canche range cooker that had been left behind by the previous owners.  We saved money by sanding and refinishing the old parquet floor ourselves. Weaposve also kept and painted the dining table that we were left from the first property we rented  years ago instead of buying a new one and Iaposve bought second hand dining chairs which Iaposm currently refinishing. Our light fitting is actually an old woven cat basket that I found in a charity shop that weaposve turned into an oversized pendant light over the dining table. I think my style is still evolving, and has certainly changed a bit to suit the kind of property we now live in. Thereaposs so much inspiration out there now that itaposs almost impossible not to keep adapting and refining your style.Iaposd say my style is a mix of natural, rustic and modern traditional elements. Iaposm also drawn to some eclectic items having lived abroad for so much of my le, so I like to incorporate those too. I love thrting unique items, thereaposs nothing better than a good second hand find. The children also get involved with shaping their home, knocking old tiles off walls and helping to paint the kitchen. Mavourneen added that there is still plenty to do in the house, and that the full transformation could take up to ten years.  We only moved in a year ago, so weaposve just scratched the surface of everything that needs to be done, she said. So far weaposve redone the kitchen, the living room, one of the bathrooms and the boysapos bedroom. But even those rooms arenapost finished as thereaposs a long snagging list. Sometimes the scale of what weaposve taken on feels overwhelming but I have to try and remember that this is a - year project and that I need to be a bit more patient with progress.  This year weaposre hoping to build a treehouse for the boys, tackle the hallway, the cloakroom and to make a start on the garden. Iaposve found a gorgeous second hand brass sink that I canapost wait to install in the cloakroomI can just find the right unit to fit it on to, whilst Iaposve given my husband some plans for the garden furniture Iaposd like us to try and build. After that, we have four more bedrooms, two bathrooms, a study and a conservatory on the list of rooms to sort so itaposs going to be a long process. Weaposve bitten off a bit more than we can chew but itaposs a joy to be able to restore a home like this.

The -year-old had his son Daice with a childhood friend who he began dating when he was . After seven years of being in an on-and-off relationship, the -year-old realised he wanted to live his le openly and told his girlfriend that he was gay. The two childhood friends are still close and Joe credits Daiceaposs mum as being one of his aposbiggest supportersapos - saying she was happy that heaposd told her the truth. Since becoming single and embracing his sexuality, Joe has found himself having to explain how he has a child on a aposday to day basisapos.  Meanwhile, his status as a dad has invited mixed responses on dating apps, with some singletons claiming he has apostoo much baggageapos. But TikTok videos showing Joe embracing le as a dad have been met with widespread praise. Joe said: I donapost think a lot of people get that Iaposm gay just from speaking to me, so when they find out Iaposm gay and a dad, theyaposre just a bit like aposWhat the f**k  How apos I find myself explaining it on a day-to-day basis. Joe says he already knew he was gay but his close friendship with Daiceaposs mum meant they just found themselves in a relationship at a young age. Joe said: I met Daiceaposs mum when I was eight years old. She used to train with me and weaposd do lyrical contemporary dance competitions together. As we got older, our friendship grew and grew. When I was  or , weaposd basically gotten to a stage where we knew we loved each other and we decided weaposd give it a go.  We were together for about seven years. It was on-and-off, we had our ups and downs, but we were best friends. I knew I was gay but because we had such a strong connection and were so close it was just easy. There was never really a moment where we said aposdo you want to be together apos, we got together and it just didnapost stop. We ended up having Daice together. It wasnapost planned as such, but we both wanted children. After he was born we got to a point where we thought apossomething isnapost rightapos. I was growing up thinking aposI like guysapos. In my mind, I knew things werenapost working out. It was in early  that we broke up. I think when COVID happened, it made me realise what was important. Leaposs too short to live it unhappily.  It was an amicable split, it wasnapost nasty or anything, we were really open and honest with each other. Sheaposs still one of my biggest supporters and my best friend. She was happy that I was honest with her, that I wasnapost leaving to be with other girls, I just needed to be who I am. We spend so much time together, we still go out for dinners. I donapost have Daice full time but I see him a lot. Iaposm very involved in his le. Joe never had a formal aposcoming outapos and grew up hiding his sexual orientation as he feared being ostracised at school. Joe said: I always knew I was gay, ever since I was little. My mum said she knew since I was two.I was a huge Miley Cyrus fan and I always wore a little blonde wig acting like I was Hannah Montana - the signs were there.I think I never come out before because I already got bullied at school for being a performer so I knewI said I was gay it would have been worse. I didn’t want people to think I was weird so I suppressed it for a long time. I knew but because I was so close with Daiceaposs mum it was easy. It was like a friendship that just grew and grew. We ended up having a baby out of it and weaposre both really happy with how it happened.  I never really had a aposcoming outapos. I never felt the need to sit everyone down and tell them I was gay. I was really down at the start of , I just thought that I needed to change my whole le around. I just needed to get to a place where I was happy. We were at a point where we werenapost really speaking, we were so unhappy. The relationship was over before it was over. I didnapost need to tell her, she knew I was like a Hannah Montana-obsessed person. She just asked me one dayIaposd date guys and I said apos%. It feels right, it feels rightapos. She was just happy that I was being open and honest. Joeaposs status as a young gay dad has drawn a iety of responses in real le and online, particularly as he navigates the world of gay dating.  Joe said: You obviously get the people who say aposyouaposre sick, itaposs wrongapos. Theyaposll say that because Iaposm a gay dad, but I couldnapost care less. I am who I am. Itaposs massively rewarding being a dad, my boy has made me who I am today. I was so down and my boy gave me the motivation to sort my le out. I look at le dferently. I feel like I have a purpose and thereaposs a reason for me to go out and work hard every day. Iaposm definitely looking to meet somebody.

However, an expert locksmith has revealed that is simply not the case and that burglars are out on the prowl whatever the weather. Elizabeth Johns also said that many Brits make a common mistake during the winter by not wanting to stand outside in the cold ripping up large cardboard boxes.  Many will leave these boxes, often which have branding of high-cost items such as TVs or games consoles, leaning against the bin - giving burglars a key indicator as to what they will find inside your home.She told the Sun : In the summer, itaposs very easy to go out to your bin and put boxes in but in the colder weather, a lot of people donapost want to go out all the way to the bins to rip boxes up to put them in the bin.So they will leave boxes out that have markers on them of high-value items. Any high-value items that come in big cardboard boxes can be quite a chore to rip up and put in the bin in the colder weather. She added that it is vital to ensure that these are hidden from burglars because it will alert them to the fact high-value items are in the property.

To find out more, visit gov.uk waytowork. Eligibility criteria apply. aposWe had loads of jobs but not enough people to fill themapos Screenprinting business Paul Bristow Associates is just one of the employers who’ve worked with Jobcentre Plus to fill vacancies. The family-run firm, based in Wrexham, produces textiles including T-shirts and printed bags – and they’ve been keen to attract younger people to roles. “One of the issues we have is the perception of manufacturing as being something we used to do in the Victorian age but no longer,” says director Ben Bristow. “Of course that’s not the case – but it made it hard to attract young people. Working with Jobcentre Plus gave us the ability to get more young people into the business and provide them with a good grounding in print and textiles.  “Our staff collaborated really well with the team at Jobcentre Plus, who gave excellent support and deserve high praise indeed.” HR manager Lee Dixon, , agrees: “The people who work there have done a fantastic job. It’s not been easy through Covid and the fact they’ve managed to help people into work is great. “It’s also massively helpful to us as an employer, given there are loads of jobs but not enough people to fill them. Through working with the team at Jobcentre Plus we’ve built up a great rapport. They’ve been first-class. “Our recruits have been a massive help in bringing in valuable skills to our business,” says Lee. “We’ve had them working in packing, admin, sewing and sales. Another guy has got a position in sustainability after he joined us from university. We’ve also had people with additional learning needs and disabilities.”apos My team made me feel very welcome and supported me apos “When I left college in January  I didn’t finish my A levels because I wanted a change, but then obviously the pandemic happened. I didn’t particularly know what I wanted to do, but I knew I would be good in a computer-based job because it’s something that I’ve gravitated towards. “Then I saw JD Sports was advertising opportunities and I thought I’d go for it because it was an administration role in a big company. It was actually the first that I applied for and everything went through really quickly – and I got the job. “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel very welcome and supported me. Day to day I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me pretty much a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since. “I’d always had an interest in HR, but after working for six months I realised it was what I wanted to do. “There was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD and CIPD Level  in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year and I’m really enjoying it. Starting work was quite tough, but I’ve got so much support from my team. It’s a lot more friendly than I expected it to be.“Now I’m learning about dferent parts of HR, building on what I was doing before. I was struggling to find any job with noexperience, but now I’ll just keep going.”Peter Cowgill, executive chairman of JD Sports, on how the company has forged links with Jobcentre Plus. “We are proud to have worked with Jobcentre Plus to provide much-needed employment and learning and development opportunities at a time when competition for job positions has been at an all-time high. Social inequality has only been exacerbated during the pandemic, so it has never been more vital to give young people a chance to succeed. “Our relationship with the DWP now covers all three nations across the UK and gives our stores, head office and distribution centres access to new talent pipelines and initiatives, which not only facilitates our future recruitment needs, but also allows us to support candidates facing social barriers, an area we are hugely passionate about.” “When I was developing my start-up in the renewable energy sector, working with Jobcentre Plus allowed me to recruit new graduates. “We’re part of the Edinburgh Business School incubator, where we get office space, mentoring and support. Since the graduates joined, we’ve moved to the stage of building a prototype.“If it wasn’t for the scheme, recruitment would have been years away –and having a few more minds to work on the concept has given us a competitive edge.“The candidates knew when they joined that they wouldn’t just be working on their own tasks and would be learning something every single day. If you’re looking for experience, it’s a great way to get it.”apos It’s important to personalise our service apos “Our service helps employers and our customers meet each other face to face, which is crucial. Employer advisers speak to both employers and the Work Coaches, who’ll send customers over who are ready for work. “We can also help employers st through CVs and hold training events to get people work-ready and match them up with the role they’ve got available. “I’ve been working closely with Lee at Paul Bristow Associates, who came along to events at the jobcentre where groups of young people could come and speak to him about what roles they had available. “A lot of employers weren’t aware of all the great services we offer, but the feedback we’ve been getting has all been really positive. Every employer’s needs are slightly dferent, so personalising our service is really important. “There are lots of sectors that are struggling to fill places, so we can help companies find a pool of candidates. We have large manufacturing areas in North Wales that are struggling to recruit people. There are also plenty of roles in the hospitality and care sectors.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Department for Work and PensionsJD SportsLee DixonJobs CentreMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton real wrench royal","story":"Kate Middleton has real wrench on royal tours that make them dficult, says expertAlthough she often appears composed and confident when travelling abroad on tours, Kate Middleton finds one part of them particularly dficult, according to one royal expertthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video royals-arrive-prince-philips-memorial-,customFields:,clearance:Network,source:bcdccbccd,sourceUrl:,site:Undefined,brandSafety: Distressing news – passed for ad targeting,showSuggestedVideos:true,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:WmBGymEU,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

She and Prince William spent last week on an action-packed and sometimes dficult royal tour that took in Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas.Despite the fast pace, Kate appeared confident and composed at engagements as they met a range of people across the three countries. However, despite appearances, royal expert Katie Nicholl says these tours are often a wrench for Kate and there is always one thing about them she finds dficult - leaving her children behind.For their journey to the Caribbean, her three children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis stayed at home.And Katie told Closer magazine : I remember being with her when we were on a tour together in Bhutan [in , when Princess Charlotte was just  months old] and we had a moment to talk about how dficult it was to leave little children behind.“Despite being the Duchess of Cambridge and being able to afford around-the-clock nannies and so on, she had her mum looking after Prince George and Princess Charlotte, which struck me as just really normal.

It is the most high-profile royal event by far that the two youngsters have attended with William and Kate keen to give them and younger brother Louis as normal an upbringing as possible. This means that their public appearances have so far been few and far between.However, now they are getting older, there have been signs that both youngsters - especially future king Prince George - are now being primed for royal le.

Barbara Young, , took the two electric scooters worth £ from Smyths in Eccles after voiding a transaction.When a shop worker realised what had happened he took a picture of Youngaposs Fiat  and threatened to call police, the Manchester Evening News reported.She was with her sister and her son when it happened. Young, of Bolton, walked out of the store with the scooters and put them in the boot of her car, whilst her sister was stopped by the store assistant as he realised a bag for le hadn’t been paid for. The woman apologised and handed him the bag for le back. It was only once he ed to the checkout he noticed the transaction had been voided in relation to the scooters, Manchester Crown Court heard. “He followed her to the car park and saw the defendant in the driving seat, and saw a male and a child in the front seat,” Juliet Berry, prosecuting, told the court. “The second female explained to the defendant that they needed to get the scooter out of the boot, to which she said the boot wouldn’t open. At this point the store assistant became suspicious and took a photo of the registration plate and said he was going to call the police.”  Young’s sister then jumped into the car as Young drove at him. CCTV of the footage showed the man clinging onto the bonnet as she drove away, shortly before he slumped to the ground. She then drove over his feet as she made good her escape. An hour later the car was found abandoned, along with one of the unicorn scooters and another bag for le. The store assistant’s phone was found on the edge of the windscreen. Following a check of the car by the police and DVLA, Young was found to be the registered keeper, but the vehicle itself was on  plates and she wasnapost insured. The man sustained numerous injuries including abrasions to his sternum, back, elbow and knuckles. In a victimaposs personal statement he said the impact on him physically and mentally was ‘hard to put into words’. Five months on from the incident he still has no diagnosis despite still suffering pain. “I have to keep going - I just keep living in this cycle of pain and torment,” he said. Young was said to have seven previous convictions for  offences including shoplting, driving without due care or attention and driving without insurance. Jane Dagnall, defending, said the car had been a gt from her family, but didn’t know it was stolen. She said she only knew the car was on  plates after her arrest. “Her instruction is that it wasn’t something she wanted to do. There was very little thought,” Ms Dagnall said. “She has been on remand for two months. The clanging of the prison gates has affected her. It hit home what it’s like to lose her liberty. “She is a young woman, she is a mother of two and she is totally ashamed and remorseful.” Jailing Young, of Crompton Lodge Caravan Park, Hall Lane, for  months, Recorder Paul Reid QC said: “You got into a car which you had no right to be driving. You had your child with you. “It’s perfectly clear he was standing immediately in front of your car. You couldn’t avoid seeing him. You chose to drive off with him in front of you, it wasn’t just a nudge, you drove into him with such force that he was propelled on the bonnet of the car and was hanging on. “You must have known you had driven over him, yet you didn’t stop to seehe was alright, such was your keenness to get away. It’s a miracle he wasn’t more seriously hurt.” Along with her prison sentence, Young, who pleaded guilty to theft assault occasioning actual bodily harm and dangerous driving as well as driving with no insurance no licence and failing to stop after an accident was banned from driving for two years and nine months and made the subject of a restraining order for seven years.

Stacy Watkins, , was told she had months to live when she was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive cervical cancer, which had already spread to her liver and pelvis, last October. The devastating blow was made even more horric when partner, Dan, , discovered a tumour on his spine, leaving their two children terried. Now, with the mum-of-two crippled by chemo and unable to walk, the family, from Reading, Berkshire have issued an urgent GoFundMe appeal to help them raise £, to fly to Mexico in a last ditch chance at saving her. Dan told The Mirror : This could be her last shot. When she was diagnosed six months ago, they told us that she had aposmonths left to live and more months with treatmentapos so we are on a time limit here. In that time she has taken a real nose e, the chemo is so gruelling on her body that she canapost walk anymore, she can sleep for  hours and still feel tired, and sheaposs in so much pain it can hurt just to hold a glass of water to her lips. Itaposs heart breaking to watch her go through all this because she is the rock of the family she is the one that has kept us strong throughout everything we have already been through. The family have already lived through years of le-threatening illnesses, after both their children, Hayden, , and Tia, , were born with crippling heart defects.  Tia needed a transplant and Hayden needed a pacemaker after they were diagnosed with congenital complete heart blocks - a disruption of the nerve system which regulates the pumping of the heart. More recently, the couple were also helping their own parents battle cancer but had coped thanks to supermum Stacy who has been the rock of the family. But after a routine blood test came back suspicious in October, doctors performed more tests and diagnosed the mum with a neuroendocrine tumour on her cervix. The type of tumour is particularly rare and dangerous because it affects the cells which release essential hormones into the body.  In the weeks following, the family were served a double blow when Danaposs backpain turned out to be a complicated tumour on his spine, for which he is still awaiting biopsy results to seeit is benign or cancerous. Speaking to The Mirror after launching their appeal last month, Dan said: “It’s literally been a whirlwind of a le, it’s coming at us from every single angle. “One of these things to happen in a letime is bad enough but all of the things happening at the same time, it’s like living in your own horror movie. Now the family have found a promising alternative treatment plan at the Hope  Cancer clinic in Mexico, where Dan says medics have already had success with Stacyaposs type of cancer.The £, target would pay for her flights, accommodation, immunotherapy, supplements andvisits for check ups. He added: It would mean everything to give Stacey this chance to live longer. All the kids want is their mum back and itaposs so frustrating that I canapost give them any certainty, As a family we have never asked for anything, we have just got one with it but now we are begging anyone and everyone to help us do everything we can to save Stacy.To donate to Stacyaposs GoFundMe click hereRead MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cervical cancerCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Why isnapost everybody cheering for the white man  Will thinks.Yes, the monarchy benefitted from slavery. Yes, protestors are calling for reparations. Yes, Iaposm completely out of touch but I got up on stage and declared slavery should NEVER have happened. What more can I do  I wonderthis was a mistake  Kate whispers - the first thought sheaposd formed on her own in a while - as she shakes the hand of a Black child through the prison- I mean gates. Safe to say, the standing symbolically high on his moving pedestal deserved the backlash it created. But from it, talk about the royalsapos hard work ethic and dedication to duty also arose. Itaposs the perfect smokescreen to move on from the controversy something the royals have had plenty of practice with. But in doing so, they stick their fingers up at the public once again, and dig themselves an even bigger hole. Will certainly takes after Daddy, Prince Charles, who is impatiently twiddling his thumbs for his five minutes of being King.  The Prince of Wales was crowned the hardest working Royal back in  - after completing  engagements. Republic states this is the equivalent of aposworkingapos  and a half days - a measly fraction of the average full-time worker, who puts in more than  days a year. And that would be fineCharles was on a pro-rata salary and just looking for a little bit of cash to fund his gardening projects. But no, the Royal has a personal income of more than £ million - meaning he gets to shake peopleaposs hands and poses for photos for an eye-watering £, an hour. We need to get rid of the idea that any of the royals are hard-working.

Judge Halpern said a lawyer representing Mrs Isbilen had told him, in an affidavit, that information had emerged to show evidence given by Mr Turk was misleading.  He said solicitor Jonathan Tickner had told him how evidence showed that money was used for purposes unconnected with Mrs Isbilen, e.g., substantial sums were paid to Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and to Sarah, Duchess of York. Judge Halpern said barrister Dan McCourt Fritz, who represents Mrs Isbilen, had told him that the total sums which his client claims were misappropriated amounted to some  million US dollars . Mr Turk has provided explanations for approximately two thirds of these sums, most of which have been allegedly spent on professional or other fees or lost in bad investments, the judge added, in his ruling.

While Her Majesty has been scaling back on her public appearances after a few bouts of poor health, she was recently accompanied by the Duke of York at a memorial for her late husband Prince Philip. The move was seen as a way of confirming Prince Andrew still plays an integral part in family le.It comes after Andrew paid off his sexual assault accuser Virgin Giuffre with a reported £million just three weeks ago. He has always denied the allegations made by Ms Giuffre and denied ever meeting her. The two heirs to the throne Charles and William were said to have been “shocked” and dismayed” as Andrew emerged front and centre.  However, Vanity Fairaposs Royal Editor Katie Nicholl said the Queen deliberately chose to have Andrew play such a prominent role on the day and shows the public she still aposmakes the decisionsapos. Katie Nicholl said: This was the Queenaposs way of showing two things one, that the buck stops with her, and she makes the decisions, and secondly that she believes heaposs innocent. She made the point very, very clearly. But Charles and William were very aware of the perspective, of the optics of this.  Unfortunately, this picture [of Prince Andrew escorting the Queen] has overtaken what should have been a memorial to a great man. Andrew has spent a considerable amount of time with the ailing -year-old monarch, who has suffered from a series of health problems in recent months as well as recovering from Covid.The Duke of York, who lives on the Windsor estate, has also been ever present at his mother’s Windsor Castle home after the death of her beloved husband Prince Philip, who died last April aged . It is believed he still holds ambitions of staging an unlikelyto front line royal duties, despite being banished being stripped of all his royal titles over Ms Giuffreaposs allegations that he sexually assaulted her in , when she was a -year-old former sex slave of his paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein..

Buckingham Palace will calculate an elderly monarchaposs above criticism on the day of her dear, dead husbandaposs memorial service. But choosing to be escorted to and from Westminster Abbey by a man who paid a reported £-million to settle a sordid sex case to avoid court was deeply distasteful. It wasnapost a sweet old maaposam who wanted to travel from Windsor Castle in state limousine with a scoundrel shunned since paying off a woman who alleged when a teenager she was force to sleep with a dad of two old enough to be her own father.  This was an elderly monarch exploiting sympathy at a personal yet very public event to walk back into polite society a reviled man forced to give up even honorary membership of a posh golf club over the scandals spewing from a close friendship with a convicted paedophile and his jailed fixer. What Virginia Giuffre makes of it one can only imagine but much of the watching world, particularly women victims of abuse, will have been revolted. The removal of his military titles and royal patronages, including the use of a His Royal Highness title, look a ersion.  The Duke of York, her favourite son, remains promoted despite stomach-churning behaviour that shouldaposve seen tainted Andrew seated out of sight at the back behind a pillar. Perhaps age and frailty are distorting her judgement because this was a colossal mistake by a declining monarch. She put her son and family before decency, trying to sell a leper to the country at a service commemorating her husband. Knee-bending courtiers will struggle from now on to argue sheaposs principled and does what is right in the service of the country.  She held on to Andrewaposs arm but it was her parading him. He continues to deny the claim but embracing the humiliated sex case settler damaged her own reputation.

He would dress like a stable lad and amid the ensuing mayhem when the race finished, grab the winner’s reins and march it confidently to the winning enclosure. A couple of times he made it, leaving us doubled up with laughter as the TV cameras were taken in by the centre-stage con man. I thought of him on Tuesday during Prince Philip’s memorial service when Prince Andrew led his mother up the aisle of Westminster Abbeyand putting himself bang in the centre of the national spotlight again. But I doubt many royals were laughing. Because how it looked, and what it said, was utterly abysmal. He wasn’t just allowed to escort the monarch to her seat by the way, but conscious that he is now unable to use his HRH title, the Queen decreed no other royal should be listed as HRH in the order of service. It was a callous and crude attempt to rehabilitate a disgraced man with an indecent haste by those at the top of this country.  It is barely a month since the royals agreed a £million payout to Virginia Giuffre who alleged she was forced to have sex with Andrew after being trafficked by his paedophile friend Jeffrey Epstein. ­Allegations he denies but allegations that he halted being tested in court by paying his accuser. The royals pushing him back into the centre of national consciousness as though nothing had happened was a kick in the teeth for every woman who has ever been abused and felt powerless to do anything about it. As Nazir Afzal, former Chief Crown Prosecutor for North West England, who specialises in cases of child sexual exploitation tweeted in reference to Andrew’s appearance: “I’m all for ­rehabilitation but it starts with facing justice, accepting responsibility and working to rebuild victims’ confidence. None of that is present here so far.” Allowing the Queen’s son to be her escort in such a public way said we royals do what we want because we are above you all. That the stripping of Andrew’s titles and honours was a pretence. It said we may live in an era when accusations of sexual harassment against high-profile men drives them into obscurity, but it’s OK. The one accused here is the Queen’s son. He’s got superior blood.  Also, Virginia Giuffre was held as a sex slave by Andrew’s friend, whom he visited on many occasions. Did the link not occur to a family that had just walked into a huge row in the Caribbean about their role in the slave trade  Did The Firm not imagine, after that catastrophic image of an aloof William and Kate driving through Jamaica in all their colonial finery, how appalling this would look  I think William did, as he looked as exasperated and uncomfortable sitting in a row behind his disgraced uncle in the Abbey as he had on that Caribbean tour. I wouldn’t be surprisedhe was wondering what the point of it all was and whether it’s right to force his kids into being players in this antiquated circus. You can but hope.

The bug, which causes nausea and vomiting, usually sees a surge in the winter months but had been kept at bay by covid restrictions. With Brits now free to mingle more than previously, germs are spreading more easily. Care homes and schools are often the worst affected by norovirus outbreaks, which then quickly spread within families. Experts have since warned parents to act fastthey notice any symptoms and to regularly wash their hands with soap water, as hand sanitiser is ineffective at killing the virus. The UK Health Security Agency, which monitors outbreaks of the vomiting bug, has urged Brits to be vigilant as cases continue to rise. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereLesley Larkin, Surveillance Lead, Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety, UK Health Security Agency told The Sun the increased cases were due to a relaxing in covid restrictions. Symptoms include sudden onset of nausea, projectile vomiting and diarrhoea but can also include a high temperature, abdominal pain and aching limbs, she added. Ms Larkin urged Brits to stay at homethey were experiencing symptoms and to avoid ing to work or sending children to nursery until at least  hours after symptoms have cleared. Those who believe they have contracted the virus are advised to keep as hydrated as possible and stay clear of elderly relatives, especially in care homes or hospitalswhile they are feeling sick. Handwashing is key to help stop the spread of this bug, but unlike for Covid- alcohol hand sanitisers do not kill off norovirus, so soap and warm water is best, Ms Larkin added.Anyone suffering from norovirus symptoms can book a phone consultationthey are concerned, but are advised not to see their GP in person. Norovirus can easily spread through contact with infected patients or contaminated surfaces, however, the virus usually passes after a couple of days. Covid restrictions also saw flu cases lower than usual during the winter months, but as restrictions have lted these too have begun to pick up. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, cases are still relatively low but have nevertheless seen an increase over her last week. Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist for the UK Health Security Agency, told The Sun the increase was likely to increased mixing in office workspaces and urged Brits to regularly wash their hands to curb the spread.

Metaldehyde pellets have been used as bait to control slugs, snails and other garden pests, but the government has moved to ban their sale and use after it was was advised that pellets can severely poison other animals Instead, gardeners have been advised to use beer to kill slugs instead. Experts from the charity Garden Organic say slugs love the drinkaposs yeasty aroma, meaning they are at least happy when they fall in and drown.The charity found that slugs are  times more likely to be caught in a trap containing lager than water, with bitter  times more effective than water, the Daily Mail reported. Garden Organic’s head gardener Emma OaposNeill said: Slugs love lager. Many gardeners know that slugs are confirmed lager louts and their love of this tipple can certainly distract them from your plants. The smell of lager and bitter really seems to attract them. The charity advises using copper tape to protect plants from slugs or luring them underneath an old roof tile with a piece of lettuce. It also recommends raised beds and containers to deter the creatures. Garden Organicaposs chief executive Fiona Taylor said that the ban on metaldehyde pellets had been a long time coming.  Metaldehyde pellets have long been recognised as posing an unacceptable risk to birds and mammals, she said. There have been cases of dogs ingesting pellets, leading to sickness and even death. Toxins can also find their way into rivers and freshwaters, posing wider harm to the environment and other wildle. We are pleased that the government has listened to safety and environment experts about the huge risks of this chemical, which far outweigh any benefits. We hope this is the start of a range of measures which sees an end to the use of harmful pesticides.  If we care about wildle and the future of our planet, we must make the positive move to organic, environmentally friendly methods for our gardens, allotments, balconies and pots. Announcing the ban in September , farming minister Victoria Prentis said: The scientic evidence is clear – the risks metaldehyde poses to the environment and to wildle are too great.

Telescopes were lined up at observatories to scan the clear blue skies for the first hint of the crescent of the new moon before reports came in that it had been seen in Sudair, Saudi Arabia. The first full day of Ramadan, with fasting from dawn to sunset, will be tomorrow - April . Some Muslims follow the Saudi announcements but other Muslim communities wait for veried moon sightings from the UK, Morocco, or where, so Ramadan can y by a day or so. That means that for some it will instead start on Sunday.In Australia, an early declaration of the date of Ramadan this year was made, Birmingham Live reports.  The Australian Fatwa Council posted on March  that it had decided Ramadan  would also begin on April , because it knew from astronomical data that it would be easy to see the moon on April . Saudi Arabiaaposs Umm al-Qura Calendar had already predicted Ramadan to start on April , . It says the month will finish on May , with the next monthstarting on May  with the three-day festivities of Eid al-Fitr. The Umm al-Qura Calendar is used by the government of Saudi Arabia for civil purposes, with its dates determined at the Institute of Astronomical  Geophysical Research in Riyadh.  Islamic Relief UK has a calendar predicting the same dates. This calculated lunar calendar is also followed by several neighbouring states on the Arabian Peninsula such as Bahrain and Qatar. However, the HM Nautical Almanac Office, a British Government agency that produces astronomical data for organisations including the armed forces, police, religious groups and diary calendar manufacturers, predicted that it would only be possible to see the new moon on Friday in a few locations, including parts of South America, the USA and Caribbean. On Saturday, April , the agency says easy sightings of the crescent moon are likely across the world with the possible exceptions of southern and eastern Australia, New Zealand, and the north-eastern parts of Russia.Muslims in the UK and the rest of Europe, and in Africa, the Middle East and most of Asia will easily be able to see the crescent with the naked eye on Saturday, it said. Astronomers in Morocco have already said that they predict Ramadan will begin on Sunday, April .  They said they would not be able to observe the moon on Friday, so the current monthwould last one more day. Observations of the moon are not the same everywhere, due to the way it orbits the Earth. It can mean Islamic dates y by a day or two in dferent countries. There can also be discrepancies within the same country or even the same city,some Muslim communities fall in line with announcements from one overseas nation and some from another.

It stated both Titanic and her sister ship Olympic were the perfect example of comfort, elegance and security. It was even compared to Noah’s Ark in terms of the importance of the ship’s role in man’s development. The brochure was clearly aimed at high-society types and painted a picture of the sumptuous surroundings the wealthy first class passengers would enjoy.  One of the key selling points was the Titanic’s grand staircase, which featured heavily in the  blockbuster film starring Kate Winslet. It described how the lights from the handsome chandelier above it would ‘reflect upon the glittering jewels of women in brilliant evening frocks.’ The brochure also detailed the lavish first class accommodation and contained nearly  pictures of the other amenities on board such as the dining rooms and Turkish baths. Although hundreds of copies would have been printed and distributed to potential customers in , only a handful are in existence today and it is extremely rare for one to come to public light.  The brochure is now being sold by a private collector who uncovered it in Northern Ireland several years ago. It is expected to sell at auction for £,. Andrew Aldridge, of auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wilts, said: “There are no more than a handful of these in existence. “It is more of a promotional brochure that was aimed at wealthy prospective passengers.  “The Titanic wasn’t due to set sail for another year and so the owners hadn’t formulated the prices at that time, which is why they aren’t in there. “The brochure was just about how this ship was the biggest and best ship on the planet at that time. “Other brochures at the time ran to  or  pages but this one was by far the largest with  pages.

He is suing London Underground Ltd at the High Court blaming a faulty turnstile. Mr Matthews, of Yalding, Kent, claims to have sustained injuries including brain damage and a fractured arm on February , . The driver says his symptoms have left him socially isolated and unable to work.“He sustained a brain injury, causing a iety of neurological symptoms including headaches, dizziness, impaired memory and speech problems,” barrister Jeremy Crowther says. “He suffers from behavioural, cognitive and emotional symptoms, prone to ­lau­g­hing inappropriately and unprompted bouts of rudeness.” Fault logs are said to have shown that the turnstile had been reported as “defective” previously due to it “spinning freely” when inspected. London Underground denies liability for his injury and insists the turnstile was always set up to be “free-flowing” when exiting the depot. Mr Matthews’ case will be heard at a later date.

And now he has revealed how to perfectly prepare your sausages in five easy-to-follow steps.With more than three decades of experience working in a professional kitchen as an award-winning Michelin-starred chef, Jeff knows his stuff, says the Daily Star, so take note.Heaposs even shared some of the most common errors home cooks make - and pricking the sausages is a big no-no. For the perfect sausages, Jeff recommends cooking them as follows: For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. . Remove the sausages from the fridge  minutes before cooking. This helps the sausage to cook evenly and prevents the skin from splitting when it hits the heat. . Pop them into a heavy-based non-stick frying pan and place them on low to medium heat. . Add a teaspoon of duck or goose fat to the pan and swirl it around until the base is fully coated. Then tip away any excess fat. . Place the sausages in the pan, making sure they’re not touching each other and keep on constant heat. Turning them regularly ensures the bangers get a rich golden colour. Jeff recommends  to  minutes for a traditional thick sausage. . Rest the sausages before serving. Once the sausages are cooked, they will be firm to touch, with an internal temperature of °C. The secret now is to let the sausages rest for a few minutes, just like you would a steak allowing the meat to relax, giving you a tender, juicy sausage. Common mistakes Jeff also shared some of the most common mistakes people make when cooking sausages.The first is pricking the skins when cooking the sausages. This causes the juice to run out, meaning youaposll be left with a dry, tasteless sausage. He also urges people never to deep fry their sausages as this can also dry them out. And finally, baking your sausages - although this may seem like the healthiest option - doing so prevents the exterior from crisping up.

He askedthings with IVF donapost work outI would be willing to be a possible surrogate , she said. I was shocked and honestly slightly disgusted by the idea. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. She went on to say how sheaposs had a rocky relationship with her father and they went a number of years without speaking, so her initial reaction was one of surprise - All of this makes the fact that he asked so shocking. When he asked I gave an awkward chuckle and said, aposI donapost even knowI ever want to physically have a child myself andI do, I would probably use surrogacy myselfI could, you know apos He was audibly disappointed when he responded with, aposNo, I donapost knowapos. There was an awkward pause and I said, aposYeah well... sorry but I love youapos. And we hung up. I was so shocked I thought I had entered the twilight zone and started to feel nauseous. She recalled how much it weirded her out that her dad felt comfortable asking this of her. I would like her to put the fear of God into him so he never considers even THINKING of me and surrogacy in the same sentence ever again, she continued.My dad is a selfish person. I know he didnapost consider the ramications of what being pregnant and having a child would have on me at all - evenI would not be involved with raising it. I know part of why he asked is because he was hoping to save the money a surrogacy agency costs. Itaposs grossing me out that he had to have thought about me being pregnant. Iaposd like to talk to my mum about this. She concluded her post by asking whether she should talk to her mother about it despite being told to keep it to herself or try to keep it together knowing she would have to confront her dad about it at some point. Reddit users were quick to share their thoughts on her situation, and many encouraged her to speak to her mum. One person said: Iaposm usually in the camp of donapost spill secrets, but this is a huge ask andyou need to confide in your mum, confide in her. Itaposs something that majorly affects you. If it eases your mind, you wouldnapost even qualy to be a surrogate. No legit fertility place will allow you to be impregnated, so his attempt to get around other fees would fail. Even the places with the loosest restrictions wouldnapost accept a surrogate that has never carried at least one pregnancy to term. Itaposs the most major of requirements.The original poster thanked them and said: That does ease my mind! I didnapost know that at all. Clearly, his time spent thinking about asking me was not spent wisely enough! Another person wrote: Can you imagine telling people you’re carrying your dadaposs baby  to which the woman replied saying: Right!  How would I explain that to literally anybody  A third added: If heaposs prepared to ask you to be his surrogate, he has to ALSO be prepared that people are going to find out about it.

The fed-up we got married in December, and recently invited her husbandaposs parents over to stay with them.Unfortunately, it wasnapost long until the mother-in-law began voicing her less than complimentary opinions on the decor and overall organisation of the newlywedsapos home. At first, she tried simply biting her lip and ignoring the criticism, but things got increasingly frustrating when the mother-in-law took issue with her husband being the one to serve the lunch. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Taking to Reddit, the unnamed woman wrote: She kept insinuating things throughout the whole lunch, saying, aposI can teach you some cooking, it is a bad omen to make your husband cookapos. I obviously do know how to cook. In fact, once I come back from work I am the one preparing dinner for both me and my husband and taking care of the undone chores . She added: When my husband was sweeping, she rushed to him as though he was a kid playing with fire or something and started sweeping for him.Every minor chore he would do during the time she stayed over, she would either glare me down until I took over or she would snidely tell him aposAsk her to do itapos.

The poster is surprised that her husband partaking in housework would be considered such a huge deal, and now wonders whether she should have simply done all the tasks during her in-lawsapos stay. However, her fellow Reddit users were quick to reassure the woman that she absolutely hadnapost done anything wrong. One person wrote: I come from a family that only let women clean and do everything. The men can order you to get water and tea and whatever they want. She brought him up to never do chores, so she made him incompetent  It doesnapost work like that anymore and I am so happy youaposre making him do something. You deserve to take it easy just as much as he does.

Trusting Alisha Moy is unlucky in love and found herself looking for matches on online dating app Tinder, and soon she matched with Jordan Cobbold.But Alisha got cold feet after just a month when the pair failed to gel and she called it off, then, in revenge, ‘needy’ -year-old Jordan used a key to sneak into her flat while she was at work. Heartbroken Alisha ed home to find her footwear filled with beans and tinned spaghetti, as well as damaged walls, furniture, clothes and brand new electrical appliances. What do you think about Alishaaposs experience  Let us know in the comments...Alisha, from Ipswich, Suffolk, said: Things turned weird. We’d be watching a film and he’d just burst into tears for no reason. I’d ask him what the problem was, but he’d just ignore me. Then, when we got together, he started saying stuff like ‘this is the stage of the relationship when everything starts going wrong’.  We’d only been seeing each other a matter of weeks! It was so confusing, I couldn’t understand why he was being so intense and needy. Alisha messaged Jordan to tell him their fling was off. He blocked me and that was it, she says. The next morning I went to work for am and didn’t get home until pm. I knew something was wrong as soon as I walked in the hallway - I usually leave all the interior doors open, but someone had closed them all.  I opened my living room door and just burst into tears at the sight in front of me. He’d pulled my shoes out of the little cloakroom and poured beans and spaghetti in there. There were condiments splattered all over the walls and cooking sauce poured all over my vacuum cleaner. Still sobbing, Alisha walked through to her kitchen where she found brand new appliances had had their cables cut through. In her bedroom, Alisha found her make-up trashed, shower gel poured in her drawers, plus more appliances and phone chargers with severed cables.  The bathroom was strewn with red bubble bath and a shoe had been chucked down the toilet.” Alisha called her mum in floods of tears. I couldn’t even speak, she recalls. Mum had to call the police for me because I couldn’t get my words out. Officers arrived within hours and Alisha moved out to stay with a relative until a forensic team had examined her flat. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. She told police she believed Jordan was responsible and they arrested him within days. Meanwhile, Alisha spent a day and a half cleaning up her trashed flat with the help of a relative. She had to repaint the living room, kitchen and bathroom and needed professionals to clean her carpets, and while she was able to repair the cut cables to some of her appliances, others had to be binned. The damage caused by Jordan’s wrecking spree was estimated at almost £,. It was heartbreaking, she says. It took months before I felt safe again. Alisha deleted Tinder after Jordan’s rampage and has since met someone new. Jordan appeared at Ipswich Crown Court in January after previously pleading guilty to criminal damage and one count of burglary after he took a necklace that he had given Alisha on her birthday. He got a two-year community order, with  rehabilitation activity days and  hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay Alisha £, in compensation and £ in court costs, and was given a five-year restraining order.

The -year-old is now convinced the German paedophile took the three-year-old British girl in May  at Praia da Luz on the Algarve. And Post claimed Brueckner boasted of burgling holiday flats during chilling “night-crawls” across the Portuguese resort. He told how the chief suspect in Madeleine’s disappearance had up to  passports from ­properties he raided. And he admitted he regrets not tipping off police about his crimes, but insisted he is willing to try to help bring him to justice over the missing toddler.German Post, a talented musician and IT expert, became friends with Brueckner, , after the pair met in an Algarve bar in the early-s. He initially believed his fellow ­countryman could not have been behind Madeleine’s kidnap and thought his criminality was limited to burglary. But since discovering Brueckner had been convicted of child sex offences in his teens, Post said it was now “so obvious” he snatched her. He added: “Now I know about his paedophile past, his rapist past. I’m % certain it was him. “I think he found her by chance and just took her on the spur of the moment. “I think once you are a paedophile, there is a switch in your brain that cannot be turned off. If he saw a little girl asleep, alone in her apartment, he would definitely have taken her. “Thinking about what he has done in the past makes me sick, it makes me want to vomit knowing I was hanging with him. If he is convicted of taking Madeleine I hope they lock him up and take away the key.”Post was tracked down by the Mirror to a small town in southern Cambodia where he lives under an assumed name. In his first ever interview he told how he and Brueckner would go to each other’s flats after they became friends. Post said he knew his new pal was on the “fringes” of crime but had no idea of the true scale until a later visit to his ramshackle farmhouse. He said: “I was sat in the living room and noticed piles of passports on the fireplace. There honestly must have been between  and  of them, neatly stacked up in three piles. “He told me he got them on his ‘­night-crawls’ in Praia da Luz, climbing onto balconies and through windows. It shows how many burglaries he must have done. “He said he would go into rooms and take what he wanted. At the time I guessed he was talking about cash, jewellery, ­passports… but now who knows  “He would only do it at night, it was too risky being seen in the daylight.  “He also said he was trafficking a bit of weed to make cash. But there was absolutely no sign he was into children or anything like sexual crimes. “Do I have regrets not telling the police about the passports at the time  I guess I do. “But now I’m willing to go back to court, to face him again, and help convict himthey want me to.” Post only discovered Brueckner had been convicted of child sex offences after reading about them in the press. And we can reveal he has twice been interviewed by detectives investigating the suspect and Madeleine’s case. Post also gave evidence against him at his  trial for raping a pensioner in Praia da Luz in , for which he is serving seven years in Germany. He fell out with Brueckner in  after the crook asked him to go to his house and clear out anything ­incriminating while he was in a Portimao prison for stealing petrol.  Post found some porn films and binned them rather than take them to a friend’s house who had children. He said: “He thought I was stealing from him or something.” The pair met briefly again in  after Post had ed to Germany to work on a Christmas market in Solingen near Dusseldorf. But after moving to Cambodia in , he was stunned when his brother rang three years later to say German detectives wanted to speak to him. Post added: “They said he was a suspect in the Madeleine case. I was absolutely shocked.” He said he had never spoken about Brueckner publicly before over fears he would be linked to the Madeleine case. And he insisted he had nothing to do with any of the suspect’s crimes. German prosecutors named Brueckner as a suspect in June  and claim to have evidence he abducted and killed her. He denies any involvement in the case. Madeleine’s parents Kate, , and Gerry, , from Rothley, Leics, continue to believe she is alive somewhere. Last week it was reported Home Office funding for Scotland Yard’s Operation Grange investigation into the disappearance will end this year. The probe, opened in , has so far cost more than £million.

Sanctioned Alexei Mordashov’s  million floating palace Nord took cover in Vlaostok after he feared it would be seized in the Seychelles.Normally Moscow’s Billionaire Set ply the waters of more exotic locations, and the sight of the ft Nord has stunned locals in Russia ’s Pacic capital.They are rushing to take selfies with the elite vessel, and customs officers who inspected the ship on arrival in port. They were escorted around the ship by one of the crew, wearing shorts. The video shows how well -year-old oligarch Mordashov - worth . billion according to Forbes - has done since he graduated from Northumbria University in England.  We can see the interiors of several decks, Toyota Land Cruiser Prado cars, all-terrain vehicles, jet skis, motor boats, and a bathyscaphe,” said one local media account. On a tour of the ship, a customs officer looks inside the -star facilities and says: “Business class room.” The crew member corrects him saying: First class”. A customs man inspects one of several drinks cabinets, and comments disapprovingly: “No Russian vodka.”  The oligarch’s study was shown, and a shower room and pantry. Mordashov is the main owner of Severstal, Russia’s largest steel and mining company. Due to the video, the smart interior of the ocean-going yacht with its own swimming pool has been exposed for all to see. “This is how the wealthy live even when they’re sanctioned,” said one comment. “Mordashov won’t get any sympathy here.”  Andrey Prokopchuk, a trade unionist, said: Previously, serious guys used to tattoo the word ‘North’ [Nord] on their arms.” It meant they had served time in a jail in Siberia or the Arctic. “Today our serious boys have changed and named their mega-yachts like this.” Others were more sympathetic. I am amazed at the ingenuity of the owner of this beauty,” said Yulia Ivanova.  “To sail this work of art for  days to its native land.” The yacht costs  million to run but it remains out of reach of Western countries while in Russian waters. Another Mordashov yacht worth  million and property worth  million was seized in Italy due to EU sanctions. I have absolutely nothing to do with the emergence of the current geopolitical tension and I do not understand why the EU has imposed sanctions on me,” he told Russian state news agency TASS. Nord sails under a Cayman Islands flag. Mordashov is the richest sanctioned person in Russia where half of its people have not been sanctioned over the war in Ukraine, according to Forbes.The businessman is the man shareholder of steel company Severstal and also owns a stake in TUI Group. Mordashov was until recently the richest man in Russia. This is now Vladimir Potanin, , the biggest shareholder in MMC Norilsk Nickel PJSC, who has not been subjected to international sanctions.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll boosts oban ahead of slockavullin final","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA group of five young Mid Argyll rugby players were in action last weekend as part of Oban Lorne under-s in the semi final of the West Youth Shield.The result of the match on Sunday March  didn#t go their way, as opponents East Kilbride ran out  #  winners, but it was a good contest and close game until Oban players sustained a few injuries and East Kilbride scored a couple of breakaway tries.Oban Lorne and the Mid Argyll contingent # Rhys Coffield, Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley, James Campbell and Sorley Self # have had a great season, winning their West under- development league, so there is plenty for the lads to be proud of.If anyone would like to enjoy some rugby this weekend, Mid Argyll under- boys will be playing on Saturday March  in the final of the West Youth Chairman#s Trophy against Kilmarnock RFC at Slockavullin.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

MWh mega-battery system mounted on an articulated electric lorry.The battery would plug into specially-constructed charging points connected to dedicated wind turbines, with charging taking  hours.Fully-loaded, the mobile unit would travel to designated points around Argyll and Bute, allowing up to  cars to charge at any time, and around  in total before heading back for a top-up.Requiring simply a flatbed trailer, the transportation of the mega-battery is interesting Argyll hauliers, with some larger operators looking into purchasing electric tractor units specically for this job.With wind energy on tap # much of the time, at least # and locally produced, charging costs are expected to be signicantly lower than existing methods.A spokesperson for Argyll and Bute Council said: #The basic idea is that this simplies the charging process and broadens our options.#It will allow the council to better utilise electric vehicles, providing cost savings while saving the planet.#For residents and visitors, it will make planning journeys so much easier and stress-free, rather than wondering how far you will get before your battery runs out.#The rota for Flying Sparks has clearly yet to be finalised # though we expect it to very much utilise the same sites as mobile post offices and banks around the region.#A number of firms operating Argyll wind farms have expressed an interest, and a pilot scheme is expected to be in place by April , .Esisteinwitz Gesellschaft chief executive Olaf Prilo sees huge potential for the scheme. #You have wind to spare,# he said, #so why not use this directly, rather than sending electricity to the grid. Just roll up to the turbine, plug in and charge up the battery.#His firm is currently researching the development of the necessary equipment to enable clean, renewable energy to be utilised in vehicle charging.Mr Prilo concluded: #There is absolutely no reason why the Argyll and Bute region could not become the Saudi Arabia of electricity.#"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert harbour open day hailed a success","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe trustees of Tarbert Harbour Authority say they are #delighted# with the success of a recent community day to discuss proposed improvements to Tarbert.More than  people attended the community day, held at the Templar Arts and Leisure Centre on March , to learn about and discuss early thoughts on plans to improve the range of opportunities, services and facilities available to Tarbert residents and visitors.Towards the end of  Tarbert Harbour Authority secured funding of £, through the UK Government#s Communities Renewal Fund as part of the Levelling Up agenda.This allowed the authority to appoint consultants who, over six months, will investigate and develop several major projects throughout the harbour and Tarbert village.After the design phase the projects will be taken to a further funding stage, the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, andsuccessful work will start on projects to transform and rejuvenate the village, harbour and its environs.The project team includes Leith-based John Renshaw Architects Mott MacDonald, an international civil and marine engineering consultancy and ruralDimensions a Callander-based tourism consultancy.Team members were on hand on March  to discuss concepts in detail and to discuss pros and cons, having prepared a presentation on  potential initiatives including re-organisation of the Fish Quay, creating more public paths and developing the existing boatyard.Everyone who visited was encouraged to fill in an exit questionnaire highlighting what they liked, what concerned them and to highlight alternative opportunities.Duncan Cunningham, chair of the board of trustees of Tarbert Harbour Authority, said: #We are delighted that people have taken the time to come and see initial thoughts and ideas on how the harbour and village could develop.#As with all these consultations, there are strong views on what is and isn#t appropriate.#We were delighted to get a range of other interesting ideas that we will now consider.#The next step is for the team to reflect on the feedback we have received and to build this thinking into plans. We will hold a follow-up session in May and present back updated thoughts.##If anyone would still like to comment on the initial proposals, they can get a form from the Tarbert Harbour office.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

to make their dream a reality.A crowdfunder campaign is already under way, with the band, which now includes Sean Morrison, Stuart Neil and Gavin Lamont, offering ious incentives for people to donate.The money collected will go towards the task of producing the album, which is hoped will be released next year.Carl, who plays electric guitar, said before their departure: “That moment where we are literally holding the album in our hands, it represents eight years of being in this band.“Having something like that to look at, and everything we have learned over these years and everything that has happened – it is a huge part of our lives.“To see the real thing, a tangible thing, a culmination of that work on a disc, would be pretty special.”Carl and Scott, who also plays guitar as well as lead vocals, formed “the rock-solid defence” of a Dunbar Colts team when they were younger and went on to bond over a love of s music.Since then, the pair have moved away from cover versions to writing their own material.As to the origins of the band’s name, Carl and Scott previously lived on the town’s Woodbush Court, with three-foot-wide Logan’s Close the quickest way to High Street.Carl said: “When we were thinking of what to call the band, the idea of making that close one day as famous as Abbey Road was pretty amusing to us, so we went with that.”The band had previously been looking forward to heading out to Germany but revealed they had run into an unexpected problem: the studio exploded.A huge bang destroyed much of the building in the early hours of the morning at the end of May last year.Carl, , said that the setback almost “scuppered” their plans but the studio equipment had now been moved to a new location.He added: “We are going to Hamburg to record the album because before the pandemic we did a wee tour there.“On our travels, we met a guy called Dennis Rux, who was saying he had got a studio with all the analogue vintage gear.

Visiting one is a chance not only to hear from established authors and new writers, but to explore the countryside.You’d be surprised at how many best-selling authors jump at the chance of meeting with readers in the smallest converted stable-block or village hall, preferring this close contact to the impersonal atmosphere of bigger venues. Soyour idea of a holiday is a good book, world class scenery and a literary get-together, then check out the festivals here, each with their own inidual character and all of them in wonderful locations.Colonsay Book Festival April -  MayColonsay is one of the most remote and most beautul islands in the Southern Hebrides, just eight miles long and two miles wide.The island is home to outstanding beaches and a wealth of bird, animal, and plant le and even with a resident population of just , Colonsay also has its own book shop, selling titles with a Scottish and Hebridean flavour.The line-up at this year’s festival includes crime writer, Alex Gray best-selling novelist, Andrew O’Hagan and John D Burns, whose latest book, ‘Wild Winter’ s to his favourite subject of Scotland’s hillsides and mountain bothies.colonsaybookfestivalUllapool Book Festival -  MayUllapool is set amongst some of the most spectacular scenery in Scotland. It’s a hotspot for geologists, who come to explore its ancient rocks. Ullapool is a planned village, built in the th century by Thomas Telford for the herring fleet and while it is still an importing fishing port, thousands of tourists also wash up here every year to marvel at the rugged beauty of the landscape. It’s a dramatic place, and so it seems fitting that Queen of Crime Fiction, Val McDermid, will be taking part in this year’s book festival, alongside poet George Gunn and playwright Hannah Lavery, with music supplied by The Fun Lovin’ Crime Writers, who will be murdering their favourite songs.ullapoolbookfestivalCromarty Crime  Thrillers Weekend- MayThe events of , when the Riot of Resolis was provoked by the imposition of a minister on the local congregation, will be brought vividly to le through dialogue and le-sized puppets as part this event. Cromarty’s book festival celebrates the sinister end of the literary spectrum and while award-winning novelist Elly Grfiths will be talking about her interest in crime and archaeology, Ian Rankin will be telling audiences how he came to complete The Dark Remains, the posthumous work of William McIlvanney. And when they are not quizzing authors, festivalgoers may be lucky enough to spot a dolphin in the Cromarty Firth.cromartyartstrust.orgWee Mac Arran Book Festival- SeptemberFrom The Famous Five to Robert Louis Stevenson’s epic pirate story and Peter Pan’s Neverland, some of our favourite tales from childhood take place on islands, so the idea of setting a children’s book festival on Arran will add an extra thrill for young audiences.The festival will offer everything from picture book pleasures to YA fiction and the island itself has beaches for picnics, bike trails and walking routes as well as the excitement of the ferry ride from Ardrossan to get to the destination.weemacarran.scot St Duthac Book  Arts Festival- SeptemberAfter a successful launch last year, the festival s this year at venues across the Easter Ross Peninsula. St Duthac is the patron saint of Tain and amongst the guests last year was local writer, Helen Sedgwick, whose novels are set in Burrowhead.When not listening to readings or admiring the work of the thriving arts community, visitors can raise a glass at nearby Glenmorangie Distillery, explore expansive Dornoch beach and discover the vast area of mudflats, saltmarsh and wet grassland that make up the RSPB’s Nigg reserve. stduthacbookfestBloody Scotland -  SeptemberFrom the battlements of Stirling Castle the view extends westwards to Ben Lomond and east towards the trio of bridges that guard the northern approach to Edinburgh, while beneath the battlements the River Forth heads for the North Sea in a series of lazy curves. Scotland’s international crime writing festival, which is based in Stirling, celebrates its th anniversary this year and away from the lecture rooms there are military and royal sites to explore and history to be uncovered in the cobbled streets that crowd around the castle. bloodyscotlandWrite Highland Hoolie- NovemberMallaig launched its first book festival last year, when broadcaster and author Sally Magnusson and poet, Jackie Kay, were amongst the writers who followed the ‘Road to the Isles’ as far as this west coast fishing port, which sits close to some of the best beaches in Scotland. Another way to reach the festival is by train, crossing the spectacular Glenfinnan Viaduct. From Mallaig you can catch a ferry to Skye or explore the Knoydart peninsula, which is only accessible by boat or on foot, and has been described as ‘Scotland’s last wilderness.’a-write-highland-hoolie"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-300-jobs-really-worth-misery-heaped-island-communities","story":"How many jobs on the islands have been lost, how many businesses have closed and how many businesses have failed to prosper and create more jobs due to the SNP decision to save  jobs  It was an abomination that the contract was entered into without the full refund guarantee, not even taking into account the failure to have an agreed design before starting production.How many jobs could have been created with the taxpayers’ money that has had to be spent on trying to get these ferries into service  How many more jobs could have been created by private businessesthey had been served better by this SNP Government The cost of this fiasco is more than the cost of building the ferries and adapting the harbours to take these ships. It runs to more than we will ever know.Jane Lax, Aberlour.BIGGER SHAMBLES AT WESTMINSTERBRIAN Chrystalwrites that “the incompetenceof some parts of the Westminster Government is undeniable but so is the case of the ferries” and for good measure and emphasis, “other aspects of delivering public services”.The previous day, John Shanksmade much the same point when he claimed that “faced with examples of SNP incompetence at Holyrood” independence supporters typically point to “something the Conservatives at Westminster did wrong”.However, both miss the critical point of scale. The ferries fiasco – and that is the correct description, for it is a fiasco – has to date a cost overrun of £ million, but that is expected to rise before the ships see service. So, lets put a contingency of another  per cent on, so £m. Not a project to put at the top – or anywhere near – your CV.However, as both Messrs Crystal and Shanks have mentioned Westminster, let’s look at a couple of instances from there.First up is that some % of PPE contracts, awarded between the beginning of the pandemic and November , have been identied as possibly corrupt, at a cost to the taxpayer estimated at £. billion.Second is that £.bn has just been written off by HM Treasury for fraudulent loans made during the height of the Covid epidemic. In addition it is estimated that loans that will have to be written off business cannot repay could amount to anything up to £bn.All in all, just these two shambles have cost the UK taxpayer anything up to £bn. The ferry fiasco has cost .% of that.No, the ferry fiasco is not something to be praised, but then again, the above considerations do appear to confirm that Westminster does do at least one thing better than Holyrood.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.TOXIC CULTURE BLAME LIES WITH SNPTHE First Minister is correct in saying that our political culture is more toxic now. I would also agree about the role of social media, which is akin to an unconstructive digital chasm .However, surely some blame for this must lie at her own partys door. Before  I was largely comfortable in my identity I was Scottish and British. I expect many felt the same, moving along a continuum. In  it was open to attack for the first time. Was I Scottish enough  How Scottish did I need to be  Was I \"quisling\" for wanting to vote No The SNP has used every election, local and national to campaign for another independence referendum where not only your political views are questioned, but your sense of identity as well. The opposition parties dutully and necessarily have to follow suit with this.Nicola Sturgeon has the power to put the clock back to the post- world, yet obviously chooses to exist in this \"polarised and toxic\" Scotland that she bemoans.David Bone, Girvan.FREEBIES HAVE TO BE PAID FORRUTH Marragain gushes about all the \"free\" goodies her wonderful SNP Government provides ­– the usual suspects of baby boxes, prescription charges, university education, personal care and on and on.As I have pointed out before, the obvious flaw in her argument is that all these \"free\" things are actually paid for from our taxes and of course income tax here in Scotland is the highest in the whole of the UK.Ms Marr then provides another open goal by raising the Borders Railway, soon to be run by the Scottish Government, whose record with Prestwick Airport, Ferguson Marine et al speaks for itself. What could possibly go wrong James Martin, Bearsden.SCOTS SHOCKING DEAL ON ENERGYTHIS April, every household in the Irish Republic will have £ automatically credited to their domestic electricity accounts while businesses and domestic consumers in Scotland will be suffering even higher bills than their English counterparts thanks to the UK’s energy policies.The daily standing charge set by the UK Government-influenced body Ofgem is going up by  per cent in parts of Scotland to p or p while in London consumers will pay just p per day. Part of the hike will go to fill the hole left by the collapse of energy firms taxpayers are already on the hook for the £ billion bail-out of Bulb energy.Scotland’s consumers also suffer from the discriminatory National Grid charges set by Ofgem whereby our renewables industries pay the highest connection charges in Europe at £. per megawatt hour, which is more than double that of our nearest competitors in Yorkshire and Humberside which have attracted most of the recent investment.Astonishingly, Norway can feed energy into our National Grid at a cost of £. per megawatt hour. France pays p per megawatt hour while Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg pay nothing to feed into our grid.To make matters worse, the National Grid sold a % stake in Britain’s gas pipeline infrastructure to Australian investment firms for more than £bn. They will be looking to increase profits from UK consumers.As energy is reserved to Westminster, there is little chance of things improving prior to independence.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh.* IN February  Scottish Power CEO Keith Anderson said energy prices would fall “in a few years” due to the expansion of renewables. However, in his article on renewables todayhe doesnt mention cost.My per-unit price for electricity has just risen from p to p overnight, and the daily charge has gone up from p to p. In what year will our bills come down, Mr Anderson Geoff Moore, Alness.WHEN WILL NORTH BE ON TRACK THANK you for today’s essays on Scotland’s future railways . All three contributors made many interesting suggestions, but with little reference to the need to properly connect Inverness and Aberdeen.The billions spent on “creating a genuinely world class railway system across central Scotland” [Iain Docherty] and the introduction of Scotland’s InterCity trains to “offer competitive journey times on most routes” [John McCormick] are really welcome. However, this still leaves the cities of Perth, Inverness and Aberdeen out in the cold for journey times and line capacity. As far back as April , the CEO of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce observed that “single-track sections of the railways linking Inverness, Aberdeen and the Central Belt are unacceptable in the st century.”Talk of a “three-hour London-Glasgow Edinburgh rail journey target time” is surely premature when this same target set for Inverness-Glasgow Edinburgh by the then First Minister in August  for completion by  is nowhere near being achieved. Indeed the Edinburgh-Inverness average journey time looks set to increase by another few minutes to three hours  minutes with the May  timetable.Three hours by rail was Priority  in the  Strategic Transport Projects Reviewto follow the Queensferry Crossing and the Edinburgh-Glasgow Rail Improvement Projects , both of which were completed long ago.

The selection of womenswear was designed in collaboration with over , women over the last two months to ensure no waste was created in the process.The pop-up aimed to allow shoppers to view, try on and buy from the limited edition collection as well as learning about the industry changes shopping with This is Unfolded is driving.There was no checkout because customers have to wait four to six weeks for their garment to be made, however, each purchase also supports a child in education. The company runs an Unfolded impact program to support children in India.Cally Russell, co-founder and CEO of This is Unfolded said the company aims to show there is a dferent way for the industry to operate.“The fashion industry is notoriously bad for the environment with % of new clothes made never being sold,” he explained. The aim behind This is Unfolded is to make sustainable clothing collections at an affordable price point.CEO Cally Russell “We know from our own research that more and more people want to buy sustainably but that often the cost can be prohibitive. With This is Unfolded we are building a completely new retail model, one that delivers sustainable and affordable clothes and avoids waste and overproduction. We then use the savings that this approach allows, to pay garment workers better wages and to create long term impact in manufacturing communities through funding children’s education.”Nothing in the collection costs more than £ and yet the garment workers are paid a living wage.“This is Unfolded removes this waste from the production and sales process to deliver truly sustainable clothing collections. The savings made are then used to improve lives – by paying workers better and creating long term change by supporting children in India in education,” Russell added.In  the company launched three collections and grew to thousands of customers across the UK – supporting over , children in education for  months through their innovative approach.The team behind This is Unfolded has a history of creating impact in the fashion industry, having established clothing initiative Lost Stock during the pandemic.It was set up to support garment workers as fashion retailers cancelled billions of pounds worth of stock orders due to the lockdown forcing the closure of stores. It left factories in countries like Bangladesh with unwanted new clothes and no way to pay their workers.Lost Stock sold this stock to consumers as ‘mystery clothing boxes’ to fund support for over , workers and their families for a month each.The success of the initiative made the team want to create something more permanent.“This is Unfolded offers capsule collections of affordable, sustainably-made clothes,” Russell said. “This new way to produce and sell clothes is powered by data, community and a factory to consumer model. Clothes are only produced once orders are placed, removing overstock and ensuring demand is matched to production.“We have just launched our fourth collection designed in collaboration with our co-creator community of over  customers who have provided feedback on styles, prints, fit and much more throughout the design process. Clothes are then only produced when orders are placed so as to avoid any overproduction.”As well as creating a new production and consumer model, the company also supports children’s education in India, through its charity partner Pratham.“We are currently funding the education of  children in India for the next year and with collection four we hope to add another  children to this,” Russell said.“So we offer clothes that not only look great but that are better for the environment, the workers and society – in order to do this all we ask of our customers is that they wait four to six weeks for delivery.”www.thisisunfolded  "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-modellers-caution-uncertainty-virus-trends-months-ahead","story":"Modelling carried out for the Scottish Government sets out five “possible futures” ranging from a reduction in infections to “very low levels” within the coming months to a scenario in which a new more virulent strain emerges and overtakes Omicron, leading to hospital occupancy “rising well above capacity restrictions”.The Modelling the Epidemic report states: “The timing is uncertain but has currently been lined up with the summer holidays where reduced travel restrictions may make it more likely that a new iant is brought into Scotland.”: Scots self-funding private hospital treatment up  per cent The authors stress that these are “plausible scenarios” but “should not be considered predictions”, adding: “It is dficult to ascertain which of these scenarios may be the more likely and in reality the situation is likely to move from one to the other and not in a linear fashion.”It comes amid uncertainty over whether Scotland’s virus rates are increasing, decreasing, or levelling off.The Office for National Statistics estimates from its surveillance that one in  people in Scotland had Covid in the week ending March , down from one in  the previous week, but said the “trend was uncertain”.Wastewater monitoring in Scotland detected an increase in virus levels of nearly % in the week ending March , compared to the previous seven days.The number of people in hospital with Covid rose to , - equalling the previous record set on Tuesday, and reversing previous signs of a decline.Mass testing for the general population in Scotland will be wound down from April , the same date that facemasks are due to become guidance rather than law.The Modelling the Epidemic report outlines five possible scenarios for the months ahead.One envisions Omicron remaining dominant, with vaccines and natural immunity holding up so that “infections may decrease from current levels over the coming weeks and months to very low levels”. Covid becomes endemic and cases “spring up only as rare outbreaks”.In a second scenario, waning immunity and “the increasing reluctance of people in Scotland to keep being boosted\" erodes population protection.: Why is Covid still wrecking the NHS - and where do we go from here The number of people requiring medical treatment or hospitalisation for Covid “rises particularly in vulnerable older age groups”, the NHS finds it harder to focus on recovery, and society “becomes segmented” as those at highest risk “lead restricted lives or accept signicant risk of serious illness” while “the rest of the population live a more normal le accepting the possibility of infection with mild illness”.A third scenario also describes a society “polarised as some continue to take up vaccines and follow guidance while others are more reluctant”.Covid cases “spring up and are hard to control in those who are not vaccinated or vulnerable” and “the very elderly and immune compromised are at risk from infection from those not vaccinated or boosted”.The scenarios range from Immune World where infections and hospitalisations fall to very low levels through summer, and a scenario where summer holidays result in the spread of a dangerous new iant leading to very high hospital demand The final two scenarios involve iants.In the first, a iant with increased transmission but not increased severity emerges resulting in a scenario “similar to what has happened in Scotland with the emergence of Omicron”.In the final scenario “a new iant appears in Scotland as peoplefrom their summer holidays andto work and school”. This has similar transmissibility and immune escape to Omicron, but replaces it and also causes more severe disease than the previous Delta strain.The report adds: “It could lead to high levels of infections leading to hospital occupancy rising well above capacity restrictions. With sustained high levels of infection we could again see increased staff absences in a number of sectors that were affected by this in the recent Omicron wave.”"},{"url":null,"title":"easyjet-ezy407-flight-bristol-glasgow-declares-squawk-7700-lands-take-off","story":"The Easyjet flight EZY was travelling from Bristol to Glasgow when it signalled the alarm shortly before .pm on Friday after a passenger took ill.It declared a ‘Squawk ’ while flying north towards Scotland around twenty minutes after it took off at .pm. Live Squawk : Track EZYU live now with Plane Finder https:t.co lvxZkOBE #avgeek #EZYU pic KVlCEASksAn emergency squawk is used to identy an aircraft that has a possible issue and enables it to have priority over other air traffic.Footage from flight radar app Plane Finder showed the plane made a rapid emergency descent into Bristol and remains grounded.A spokesperson for EasyJet said: “We can confirm that flight EZY from Bristol to Glasgow today erted back to Bristol due to a passenger on board requiring urgent medical assistance. The passenger was met by medical services on arrival and the flight will continue to Glasgow.“The safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is always our highest priority.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for.

We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year.

But the Houthis did not attend the talks because they were held on neutral territory.Last Saturday, the Houthis also announced their own unilateral initiative that included a three-day suspension of cross-border attacks on Saudi Arabia, as well as fighting inside Yemen.Their announcement came shortly after they claimed attacks on a key Saudi oil facility in the Red Sea city of Jiddah, ahead of a Formula One race in the kingdom.On Friday, in a Twitter post, Mohammed Abdel-Salam, the spokesman and chief negotiator of the Houthis, welcomed the ceasefire.Yemen’s war began in September , when the Houthis swept into the capital, Sanaa, from their north-western stronghold in the Arab world’s poorest country.The Houthis then pushed into exile the government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, elected in  as the sole candidate after the long rule of Ali Abdullah Saleh.A Saudi-led coalition, including the UAE, entered the war in March  to try and restore Mr Hadi’s government to power. But the war, which evolved into a proxy conflict, stretched into long bloody years, pushing much of Yemen’s people to the brink of famine.The United Nations and others had been pushing the coalition and rebels to stop the fighting for Ramadan, as has tenuously occurred in past years.“This is the result of fairly painstaking work” by Mr Grundberg and other diplomats, Mr Haq said. He said the envoy called the truce “a first and long-overdue step” toward ending the fighting that has killed more than , people, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project figures. That figure includes both fighters and civilians.During the two-month truce, the Saudi-led coalition will allow  vessels carrying fuel into the port of Hodeida, and two commercial flights a week from and to the Yemeni capital to Jordan and Egypt.After the truce takes effect, the UN envoy will call for both sides to convene to agree on opening roads around Taiz and other provinces, the document said.Taiz, which remains partially held by the forces fighting on behalf of the internationally recognized government, has been blockaded by the Houthis for years.There are hopes the truce could build momentum for further steps towards peace, though past attempts at ceasefires have repeatedly fallen through. The terms of this latest agreement bear a resemblance to a  peace deal that brought an end to fighting in Hodeida but failed to bring wider peace.The Iran-backed Houthis and Yemen’s internationally recognised government have also said they were working on a deal to release over , prisoners of war, including Mr Hadi’s brother and a former defence minister."},{"url":null,"title":"james-mcfadden-backs-scotland-absolutely-magnificent-england-clash-happens  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

We got slaughtered for celebrating a - draw but it was a great performance and I think it showed the potential of the young team.“Over the course of the qualying campaign, a really good performance and result against Denmark has shown that this team has really grown, and they have responded to the disappointment of not being able to get out of the group stages of the Euros.“It was always a worry, because we hadn’t been to a major tournament for so long, to get to the tournament and have a couple of games at Hampden and not really play as well as we know they can, but the response from the players and management has been outstanding.“The last game of the group against Denmark was such a strong performance. How far we have come, even in the space of six months, is remarkable, which gives us hope that it can be much further improvement come the play-off in June.”McFadden, who scored  goals for his country, added: “Now we are in a really good place, we have a strong squad, good options all over the pitch, and we go into these games in June with great confidence and optimism that we can get the job done. vw,vw,px, px\"Scotland’s James McFadden celebrates scoring against Moldova in  “And then again,all goes well, going into the World Cup in a really good place, with a strong squad, I think we will be in a much better position– and it’s a massive– we manage to qualy.“It will be tough but the big incentive is obviously to get to a World Cup, we haven’t been there since , and to top it all off, you get to play against England again in your group, which would be absolutely magnicent.“It’s a big enough incentive in itself to get to the World Cup but knowing that you’re going into a group again with England is great and I’m sure it will motivate the players going into those play-off games.”"},{"url":null,"title":"casper-ruud-reaches-first-masters-1000-final-victory-miami  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

It is immoral I think, but ultimately there are no laws to say you cannot dismiss your employees without notice.“There are laws to say you should consult before you do that andyou don’t employees can claim a protective award but there are no sanctions as such that can be taken against iniduals.” vw,vw,px, px\"A demonstration against the dismissal of PO workers takes place outside the Port of Liverpool The TUC said it sees the dismissal of the  seafarers as an attempt by PO Ferries to “bypass” employment laws as bosses have “sought to impose the changes rather than negotiate them”.The union organisation said the plan was to replace seafarers on union-negotiated wages with low-paid agency staff thanks to gaping holes in the minimum wage rules as they apply to overseas workers on non-UK flagged vessels.PO may be investigated for failing to noty the Government in time but it is dficult to find previous examples of employers who have been hit with a punitive fine, Ms North and the TUC said.Companies can also face having to pay affected workers maximum protective awards of  days’ pay.It is possible that PO may have simply priced in the potential cost of such an award in its offer to dismissed seafarers, the TUC suggested.Ms North added: “I think it is part of a director’s duties to think about the financial viability of the company and do everything it can to ensure it does not go under but that should not just be from a personal point of view – there should be more consideration of how the decision being taken by the board affects the employees and not just the balance sheet.”"},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-284-march-30-wordle-word-hints-todays-answer  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “It is important that consumers are made aware that their domestic gas bills will stay high for at least the next year because the wholesale price that the companies pay for the gas continues to be much more expensive than the norm.

This will further increase the numbers of people in fuel poverty, as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “As the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme ends today , we implore firmus energy, and the wider energy industry, to commit to financially supporting the continuation of a fuel hardship scheme in the coming financial year. For the longer term, it is clear that energy companies, policy makers, the Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high energy prices will likely be with us for the foreseeable future.” Consumers who are struggling to pay their energy bills or struggling to pay to top-up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support.

It is immoral I think, but ultimately there are no laws to say you cannot dismiss your employees without notice.“There are laws to say you should consult before you do that andyou don’t employees can claim a protective award but there are no sanctions as such that can be taken against iniduals.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cfbe--d-c-eadf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cfbe--d-c-eadf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cfbe--d-c-eadf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cfbe--d-c-eadf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"A demonstration against the dismissal of PandO workers takes place outside the Port of Liverpool PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueA demonstration against the dismissal of PandO workers takes place outside the Port of Liverpool The TUC said it sees the dismissal of the  seafarers as an attempt by PO Ferries to “bypass” employment laws as bosses have “sought to impose the changes rather than negotiate them”.The union organisation said the plan was to replace seafarers on union-negotiated wages with low-paid agency staff thanks to gaping holes in the minimum wage rules as they apply to overseas workers on non-UK flagged vessels.PO may be investigated for failing to noty the Government in time but it is dficult to find previous examples of employers who have been hit with a punitive fine, Ms North and the TUC said.Companies can also face having to pay affected workers maximum protective awards of  days’ pay.It is possible that PO may have simply priced in the potential cost of such an award in its offer to dismissed seafarers, the TUC suggested.Ms North added: “I think it is part of a director’s duties to think about the financial viability of the company and do everything it can to ensure it does not go under but that should not just be from a personal point of view – there should be more consideration of how the decision being taken by the board affects the employees and not just the balance sheet.”Most ReadSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatHaving a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayHow to spot the Northern Lights over Northern Ireland tonightRoy Reynolds: Co Antrim murder victim suffered ‘barbaric injuries’, court told‘My baby would still be aliveI’d got proper care at Lagan Valley Hospital’: Grieving mum speaks outTop Videos programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

The SDLP#s MP for the area, Claire Hanna, who romped home in the last general election with some , votes, around , more than the nearest candidate — expressed her shock at the turn of events. The constituency is also larger than East and West Belfast and is the most erse of all NI#s electoral areas, ing MLAs from five dferent parties: SDLP, DUP, Alliance, Sinn Fein and Greens. There is a term for this move by Sinn Fein we are all too familiar with: gerrymandering.What is most curious about this move is that, back in , proposed changes to electoral boundaries here that would seemingly have favoured the DUP were branded “gerrymandering to placate” Northern Ireland#s largest unionist party by Sinn Fein. This criticism was not voiced by one Sinn Fein representative or party spokesperson at the time, but at least half a dozen, in what was essentially a media blitz in a bid to put a spanner in the proposals.What is even more curious is that press statements on Sinn Fein#s website referring to said gerrymandering have vanished. If you simply google “Sinn Fein on gerrymandering” and click on any of the ious links which previously directed to statements from Conor Murphy, Colm Gildernew, Francie Molloy and others on the Sinn Fein website, you are greeted with the following  error message, reading: “We#re sorry, but the page you requested could not be found on our servers. We may have recently moved, renamed, or deleted certain pages.”It seems, much like the party#s previous stance on Russia, they are simply trying to avoid accusations of double standards and prone to extreme stance-switching when it suits them.Read MoreSinn Fein defend proposals to redraw Belfast’s electoral boundariesAn April Fool’s wish listDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Ah, April Fool#s Day. Given the state of world at the minute — war in Europe, the cost of living crisis on the tail end of a pandemic that hasn#t gone away - I was hoping we would give it a rest this year, lest we cause more unneeded distress. One humorous political wish list, however, was posted on Twitter by human rights organisation Participation and the Practice of Rights , reading: “‘Stick your hostile environment’ — Givan tells UK Home Office. ‘Mackies will be % social’ — Hargey takes action on housing rights. ‘Our policies are the problem, not you’ — Swann promises counsellors in every GP practice.” We can but dream.NI#s most unambiguous partyAn interesting press statement was released by the TUV on Friday, which declared that the party#s designation on the ballot paper for May#s poll will read: ‘TUV — No Sea Border’.Explaining the move, TUV leader Jim Allister said: “Having led where others have followed we wish every voter to see the issue identied without ambiguity on the ballot paper. There will be no doubt as to what a vote for TUV means.”Now, the TUV have been accused of being many things, but ‘ambiguous’ is definitely not one of them. Anyone with even a slight grasp of Northern Ireland politics could probably predict the party’s stance on any given issue before Jim Allister’s party has voiced its opinion. So this just seems like a needless waste of ink. I doubt anyone was going to be mistaken that they were actually voting for a bunch of liberal Europhiles.Related topicsSinn FéinSDLPConor MurphyClaire HannaMore On Sinn FéinDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson claims Sinn Fein ‘solely focused’ on border poll PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapse PremiumSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatSinn Fein slammed for election launch at Belfast’s Europa Hotel which was repeatedly bombed by IRACriticism as Electric Ireland customers facing nearly £ rise in annual billsMost ReadSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatHaving a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayHow to spot the Northern Lights over Northern Ireland tonightRoy Reynolds: Co Antrim murder victim suffered ‘barbaric injuries’, court told‘My baby would still be aliveI’d got proper care at Lagan Valley Hospital’: Grieving mum speaks outTop Videos programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

Now is not the time for ision and uncertainty.That is why this election is so important.Sinn Fein has been contacted for comment.Speaking at an election launch, Ms O’Neill said that Sinn Fein will defend but not renegotiate the Good Friday Agreement.The former Deputy First Minister said those who hanker for the past need to realise that there is no going back, only forward.Sinn Fein#s Stormont leader also described the DUP#s collapse of the Executive as political vandalism, although her own party also brought Stormont down in the same Assembly mandate.She said: When the Assembly, Executive and North South Ministerial Council were restored in January  it was with a shared commitment to deliver the public services, societal reforms and future that our people need and deserve.It was ambitious to form a five-party coalition Executive, but it was achieved, getting us back to genuine power-sharing, and thankfully so, because while everyone knew there would be challenges ahead, no one could have predicted that in only a matter of weeks that our Executive would be dealing with a global pandemic that would have such devastating impacts on every part of society, community and people#s lives and livelihoods.It is to the credit of all ministers from across the five parties that they responded and have worked with a unity of purpose, and unity of leadership for the past two years.This is what the public want to see more of — co-operation and delivery.Ms O#Neill added: Sinn Fein will be defending, not renegotiating the Good Friday Agreement now, or in the time ahead.Ms O#Neill said the May  election was the most important in a generation.Related topicsSinn FéinMichelle O#NeillIRACost of LivingTraditional Unionist VoiceGordon LyonsThe Executive OfficeMore On Sinn FéinDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson claims Sinn Fein ‘solely focused’ on border poll PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapse PremiumSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatCriticism as Electric Ireland customers facing nearly £ rise in annual bills PremiumJust £k spent as multi-million pound Northern Ireland football stadiums scheme lies idleMost ReadSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatHaving a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayHow to spot the Northern Lights over Northern Ireland tonightRoy Reynolds: Co Antrim murder victim suffered ‘barbaric injuries’, court told‘My baby would still be aliveI’d got proper care at Lagan Valley Hospital’: Grieving mum speaks outTop VideosPlayPolice attend the scene of a serious RTC on the Springfield Road in west Belfast programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

Credit: Brian Lawless PAMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe UUP manesto has enough meat to show that the party is starting to think seriously about being a major player in the Executive once more, and enough bare bones to reveal that the process is incomplete.At , words, this document is serious in its scope and suffused with the liberal unionist tone of new leader Doug Beattie.But it is what this manesto does not say which reveals most: hard choices or unpopular proposals are either absent or presented in oblique terms — and that jars with Mr Beattie’s straight-talking style.Health is the first and the iest section — unsurprisingly, given that polling has shown Robin Swann to be Stormont’s most popular minister.The manesto indicates support for radical measures, saying that the pandemic has shown that both patients and medics are willing “to travel longer distancesit means receiving care and support in a more timely manner. It is essential that the opportunities currently before us are not lost”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreNo united Ireland for generations to come, UUP leader insistsAndrew Madden:OpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeThat seems to hint at support for implementing the decades of reports which say Northern Ireland has too many small hospitals, some of which need to be closed or downgraded to centralise expertise in centres of excellence.But the UUP is not explicit about this.There are other hints of centralising services — “a regionally consistent approach to cancer services across Northern Ireland” with “regional pathways and rapid diagnostic clinics”.The party also proposes greater evening and weekend use of theatres, but hints at the cost by saying it will mean “properly incentivising the move towards a genuine seven day a week health service”.Signicantly, the party says it would ban the use of contract agency workers — but only “once the immediate HSC pressures subside” .Health trusts are sharply criticised, with the UUP saying that for too long “sub-optimal trust performances [have been] tolerated”, something which suggests frustration at what Mr Swann has seen within the system.His solution is a new operationally independent HSC chief executive accountable to a board with political, professional and civic society membership, similar to the Policing Board.On the NI Protocol, the UUP says that “unionists cannot accept an internal border within the United Kingdom. There can be no border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain”.That simple commitment seems to prevent the UUP signing up to any revised protocol involving an Irish Sea border.Its tone is dferent to the DUP, talking about wanting to “maintain good relations with the EU”, but the content is similar to that of the ERG — pushing mutual enforcement, with a new north-south body to oversee this. A requirement to label GB goods coming into NI “for UK sale only” would only avoid a new Irish Sea borderit was enforced for all UK products.The party would ban gay conversion therapy, establish a gambling regulator, allocate overdue investment to football stadia, and examine letting private garages do MoT tests.The party opposes a Troubles amnesty and robustly says paramilitaries “need to be put out of business permanently” by focussing on their leaderships and criminal assets. It wants to curb legal aid, due to “the culture of lawfare which has been allowed to develop within our legal system and which has proved extremely lucrative for a number of firms”.The manesto is laden with more spending — new train stops, new busses, new roads, more rates relief for some businesses, spending on city deals,  more police officers, and looking at giving everyone in primary school a free meal.How this would be paid for is unclear. There is no talk of increasing rates. Water charges are ruled out. And giving Stormont more tax powers is also rejected. Changing the status of NI Waterand the Housing Executive to allow them to borrow is about as far as funding proposals go.This is a detailed document, yet many of the proposals are all things to all people – it is pro-business, but also pro-worker pro-grammar schools, but looking to review how academic selection operates, pro-EU, but anti-protocol.None of those things are necessarily contradictory, but in not being clearer about some of the most controversial or unpopular areas, the party is putting off having to take those decisions until after they’ve got the votes.Related topicsUlster Unionist PartyDoug BeattieThe Executive OfficeRobin SwannNI ProtocolMore On Ulster Unionist Party PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapseAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudge PremiumJust £k spent as multi-million pound Northern Ireland football stadiums scheme lies idleCarrickfergus murder probe: Woman’s horror at reservoir body find PremiumSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismMost ReadSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatHaving a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayHow to spot the Northern Lights over Northern Ireland tonightRoy Reynolds: Co Antrim murder victim suffered ‘barbaric injuries’, court told‘My baby would still be aliveI’d got proper care at Lagan Valley Hospital’: Grieving mum speaks outTop VideosPlayPolice attend the scene of a serious RTC on the Springfield Road in west Belfast programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

Credit: Liam McBurneySuzanne BreenTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailSDLP MP Claire Hanna has spoken of her shock at a Sinn Fein proposal to abolish the constituency of South Belfast.In a submission to the Boundary Commission, the party proposes the constituency is axed with its voters largely ided between two other constituencies — despite South Belfast having more voters than either East or West Belfast.Ms Hanna said Sinn Fein’s proposal “does not make any mathematical sense” and that residents would be stunned it was seeking to abolish Northern Ireland’s most politically erse constituency.Sinn Fein has been contacted for comment.South Belfast currently is the only constituency toMLAs from five dferent parties: SDLP, DUP, Alliance, Sinn Fein and Greens.Ms Hanna said: “Each of Belfast’s four constituencies has a distinct identity, community cohesion, and things they are proud of. South Belfast has for decades been known as a erse, integrated part of the city where people of all political views and none live side-by-side.“Many people chose to settle in South Belfast precisely because of that. This constituency is, and always has been, a shared space.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “It is pluralist in its politics and values, and I think residents would be very disconcerted and concerned at a proposal to break it up and to parcel bits off into other constituencies.”Read MoreTalks need to begin over scrapping mandatory coalition, says Arlene FosterThe rules for the  Boundary Commission review mean each constituency must have an electorate of between , and ,.North Belfastand South Belfastfall within the target range. West Belfastand East Belfastdo not.Ms Hanna lodged her objections to Sinn Fein’s proposal at a meeting with the Boundary Commission last month.“West and East Belfast are below the statutory electoral range by , and , voters respectively,” she said.“The high level of house-building in South Belfast, particularly in the Four Winds and Malone, together with the council’s determination to repopulate the city core, means the number of electors in South Belfast is going to rise further within a parliamentary term.“The Boundary Commission was happy for Northern Ireland to keep all its  seats. In previous proposals in , which were dropped, it had wanted to reduce to  seats, so somewhere would have had to take the fall.“Sinn Fein’s proposal is even more surprising when the Boundary Commission isn’t even looking to lose a seat.”Under Sinn Fein’s plan, Belfast would be reduced from four constituencies to three.East Belfast would remain, absorbing parts of South Belfast, and two new constituencies would be created — North West Belfast and South West Belfast.Ormeau, Rosetta, and Ravenhill would be moved into East Belfast. Malone, Stranmillis, and Finaghy would be put into the new South West Belfast constituency.Demographic trends suggest Sinn Fein would secure both the South West and North West Belfast seats at a Westminster election, with the SDLP losing out. The influx of South Belfast voters to the east of the city would help Alliance unseat the DUP there.In its submission to the Boundary Commission, Michelle O’Neill’s party says: “Sinn Fein believe that too much emphasis is placed in trying to keep Belfast as four-seater constituency which comes at the detriment to the rest of the constituencies.”Under the Boundary Commission’s plan, South Belfast remains largely intact, but gains the rural wards of Drumbo, Saintfield, and Moneyreagh to become South Belfast and Mid Down. Strangford would be renamed Strangford and Quoile.Professor Jon Tonge of the University of Liverpool said the commission’s proposed boundary changes were “fairly minimalist”.“Fermanagh and South Tyrone — very marginal — becomes fractionally more nationalist, which will please Sinn Fein. Foyle becomes a bit more nationalist, and East Londonderry a bit more unionist,” he said.Related topicsClaire HannaSinn FéinSDLPAlliance PartyGreen PartyMore On Claire HannaSir Jeffrey Donaldson and Doug Beattie to share stage on youth mental health issues this weekendNorthern Ireland could be set to welcome Ukrainian refugees under new Home Office visa scheme PremiumJon TongeOpinionSDLP and Sinn Fein could swap unity manestos and no one would notice PremiumSDLP’s Colum Eastwood: ‘SF are focused on themselves and on securing jobs for their friends’Ian Paisley ‘took most freebies of all Northern Ireland MPs’… DUP veteran accepted tickets to Open and British Grand PrixMost ReadSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatHaving a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayHow to spot the Northern Lights over Northern Ireland tonightRoy Reynolds: Co Antrim murder victim suffered ‘barbaric injuries’, court told‘My baby would still be aliveI’d got proper care at Lagan Valley Hospital’: Grieving mum speaks outTop Videos programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

Irsquod just broken up with my first girlfriend and I think it was me subconsciously expressing stuff about that.Confirming the sci-fi influence, Tim mdash who recently became a dad for the first time mdash said Girl From Mars mostly revolves around the verse and chorus.ldquoI wrote them as a slow little strummy thing and then when we worked on it as a band we rocked it out quite a lot. My little brother Pat was always my first port of call of seeinga song was good and then Irsquod bring it to [bandmates] Mark [Hamilton] and Rick [McMurray].ldquoI used to love going and knocking on his bedroom door and playing him ideas and I remember that he flipped out about the song and loved it. He had the idea for the quiet verse after the guitar solo and it was great.Tim said as soon as the band started playing it they got a really good reaction from their friends.ldquoI used to play stuff before Irsquod even fully written the lyrics wersquod play stuff at shows and Irsquod mumble my way through it. I donrsquot think I wrote the second verse until we actually recorded it two years later.ldquoI wasnrsquot too worried about lyrics back then, maybe because I listened to Nirvana so much and could never really understand them.

McComiskey saw team-mate Joseph Burns in the mouth of the goal and looped the ball in, but Burnsrsquo effort goes just wide.Castlewellan had their first real chance on the th minute when their corner-kick met the head of Donagh Steele. However, the ball went just over the bar.Ballynagross got their second goal on the th minute after a throw-in from Ryan Tumelty to John Shields allowed the attacker to spray a pass to the right wing to find team-mate Doran. The lively lsquoGross forward found Joseph Burns and the chance was duly converted into a goal.With half-time nearing, it looked like Ballynagross would be going into the interval with a comfortable lead, but an error when clearing the ball from the defence enabled Castlewellanrsquos David Gilmore to close the lead to just a goal as the referee blew his whistle.Castlewellan came out in the second-half with an all out attack approach and it paid off through a corner kick in the st minute.This time Donagh Steele ensured the ball was going into the back of the net and the game was level. It was not to stay this way for long as the Castlewellan goalkeeper clearly took Ballynagrossrsquo Shea McComiskey down inside the box and a penalty was awarded.Connor Marron stepped up to take the penalty and finished well into the top left corner of the net.Castlewellan continued to push forward, but Ballynagross defence of Corey Davis, Connor Marron, Ryan Tumelty and Tom McNeill were holding strong.For the next  minutes it was pretty even, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan took a chance on the edge of the box but Cathail Arnold easily saved. Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick close to the Ballynagross net, but David Gilmorersquos effort was straight at the goalkeeper.Ballynagross had a chance from a corner but it was well cleared by Castlewellan.Forest striker Shane Mooney found himself booked for his comments to the referee in the rd minute.Castlewellan were very much seeking out a goal to level and it came in the th minute after a scrap for the ball in Ballynagrossrsquo box resulted in Shane Mooney scoring with the last kick of the game to send the tie to extra-time.There were a few chances during extra-time for Ballynagross, although neither team could find a break through to escape the need for penalties. Castlewellan swapped out Brian McVeigh in goal for Sean Dornan.Ballynagrossrsquo Connor Marron, who had already scored a penalty during the game, was first to step up and easily converted.Castlewellanrsquos Shane Mooney and Ballynagrossrsquo Declan Dowie followed and both scored.Forestrsquos new lsquokeeper Dornan came out of the net and rushed his penalty, sending the ball over the bar.John Mahoney made no mistake to give his lsquoGross side a further advantage before Ciaran Stratton kept Castlewellan in with a chance.Ballynagrossrsquo John Shields walked up to take his penalty but the lsquokeeper saved to bring it level again.Eoin Travers converted his penalty and now it was sudden death.Tom McNeill confidentially scored his penalty meaning all of the pressure fell on Castlewellanrsquos Ryan Morgan to keep the game going.However, his effort was saved resulting in Ballynagross progressing to the final.Ballynagross: C Arnold, T McNeill, R Tumelty, C Marron, C Davis, J Polley, J Shields, J Burns, L Shields, P Doran, S McComiskeySubs: D Craig, D Dowie, J Mahoney, K Taggart, A Beattie.Castlewellan Forest: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, J OrsquoNeill, N Travers, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, A Dornan, D Gilmore Subs: S Kinley, G Kidd, E Travers, R Morgan, J Murnin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dismal end to league campaign  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo miserable campaign reached its conclusion as they lost out on home soil to Clare on Sunday.The Mourne side entered this fixture already relegated from Division  and were hoping to gain some,any, momentum ahead of their crucial upcoming Ulster campaign.The uphill task will include having to better Monaghan on May  and then the winner of Cavan and Antrim to make the concluding stage to feature in the All-Ireland series and avoid ato the second-tier championship.Down took to the field in Newry against a Clare side who had endured a mixed bag of results within their league fixtures having won their opening three before losing the next trio of matches.For Down, the loss concludes a point-starved run of fixtures having finished with just one draw and six losses.Clare fielded what appeared to be a physically stronger outfit than their counterparts at Paacuteirc Esler and Downrsquos efforts werenrsquot aided by their lack of discipline.Both Gerard Collins and Pat Havern picked up black cards towards the end of each half while team-mate Finn McElroy picked up a red card with  minutes played.By that stage, the Mourne side didnrsquot appear to be getting anything from the game but that will be little solace to Down boss James McCartan, who has endured a nightmare beginning to his second stint at the helm.Aaron Grfin scored the first goal of the match with nine minutes played, courtesy of a smart left-footed finish which bested Kilcoo-native Niall Kane at his near post.To their credit, Down showed some resilience and managed to notch the next four from five points available with Burren man Liam Kerr kicking over a well-taken score amongst these.However, Clare continued to attack the Down goal and found their second major of the match thanks to Cian OrsquoDearsquos effort.His lowly struck shot took the wind out of Downrsquos sails and the Mourne side entered the break six points adrt at -

ndash The Government is poised to unveil an astonishing pound million scheme to replace the Strangford ferry service with a road tunnel under the lough.The scheme has already been approved at ministerial level and it is believed that the pound million originally intended for the Downpatrick bypass road will be used as start-up capital, with phase top-up grants being sought from the European Community and the Ireland Fund as the scheme progresses.Plans for the mile-long road tunnel have been drawn up by senior consultants engaged by the government and it is believed that the entry points will be manned toll booth terminals in Strangford and Portaferry.The move to replace the ferry service with a tunnel received an extra impetus recently when it was revealed that the ferry service was running at a substantial loss and villagers in Strangford vetoed plans for a new jetty for the vessels.Sources within the government say that the tunnel plan, which has been gathering dust for a number of years, has now been reactivated and local roads bosses intend erting the money intended for Downpatrickrsquos ring road to the scheme before the end of the financial year.Publicly, however, officials are remaining tight-lipped about the project. ldquoThe tunnel plan was first put forward several years ago, but as far as I am aware there are no plans to revive it, said a press office spokesperson.Nevertheless, conservation organisations have been consulted about the possible environmental impact of a tunnel, and a study of its possible effects has been carried out by a university team under the guidance of Prof A Lilo.Prof Lilo told the Recorder: ldquoAs far as I can see, there would be little threat to the loughrsquos balanced ecosystem from a tunnel.There may,

going to quiet parts of the town for their parties, a special meeting was told on Tuesday.The police have raided a number of these gatherings in recent months but the teenagers simply move to a dferent location and continue their drinking sprees.While the problem of underage drinking in Downpatrick has not risen in recent years it is nevertheless sufficiently worrying to prompt a group of local community representatives to get together to discuss ways of tackling the issue.Last week youth workers, headmasters, teachers, publicans and councillors met together under the auspices of the RUCrsquos Community Relations Branch and debated the causes and possible remedies of underage drinking.The end result of the discussion was that public awareness needs to be heightened, while teenagers, and their parents, should be appraised of the dangers of alcohol abuse in the young.Superintendent Ronnie Hawthorne, Downpatrick sub-isional commander explained that the problem is a province-wide concern and is not just confined to Downpatrick.He added that underage drinking is also taking place in other parts of Down District.ldquoThere is a problem throughout Northern Ireland and we cannot stop underage drinkers ourselves, we need the help of the whole community, said Superintendent Hawthorne.ldquoThere are a lot associated problems with underage drinking and we will talk

They also cause signicant damage to wildle and the environment.Mourne Heritage Trust staff helped with the response to last weekrsquos wildfires using strimmers to create fire breaks, also helping with a controlled back burn and using its argocat all-terrain vehicle and fogging unit to extinguish one branch of a fire that was threatening some field boundaries.In addition, one of the Trustrsquos teams, along with a firefighter, used this specialist equipment to extinguish the fire at Finlieve near Rostrevor.NI Water has also warned that wildfires can have impact on drinking water supplies.The organisation controls so-called water catchment areas in the Mournes which supply water to all of Northern Ireland. The organisation said while it is working hard to deal with the problem of wildfires, it wants to assure customers that tap water quality is unaffected and is of a very high quality.But NI Water has warned that wildfires within catchments not only pose a terrible risk to all le but can remove the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil exposed to erosion which then makes its way into the reservoirs, from where water is abstracted for treatment to provide drinking water.ldquoThe erosion caused by wildfire increases carbon and other polluting chemicals signicantly in untreated water, with sediment accumulating in streams, lakes and reservoirs, said NI Waterrsquos Rebecca Allen.ldquoThis makes raw water especially dficult and more expensive to treat at our facilities to the stringent standards required by the Drinking Water Regulations. A signicant amount of other work by our water supply colleagues also has to be undertaken at the treatment works to ensure excellent quality drinking water during these times.Rebecca added: ldquoExtra water samples have to be collected and analysed, streams from burned areas need isolated, and other remedial measures must be taken like blocking streams to protect reservoirs.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has praised firefighters, other arms of the emergency services and the Mourne Heritage Trust for their efforts to bring the blaze at the Bloody Bridge under control.He said firefighters in particular were overwhelmed by the support from the community.ldquoI witnessed the devastation of the wildfire first hand which impacted a site that is a protected habitat renowned around the world, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe emergency services, particularly local fire crews, should be commended for the professionalism they displayed when dealing with these incidents. However, malicious fires place a massive strain on very limited resources and as we approach the summer I would urge people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the PSNI.Cllr Clarke said the damage caused by gorse fires has a lasting impact and that areas of outstanding natural beauty can take years to recover, calling for a co-ordinated response from the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, NI Water, health and public safety departments and the Department of Justice.He continued: ldquoWe need to see a collective response with a sharing of resources and there needs to be additional funding provided to build upon the best practice Mourne Heritage Trust has undertaken to reduce the impact of these fires in the High Mournes. Controlled burns and better land-management needs to be re-established.ldquoMeasures should include the establishment of fire breaks to reduce the fuel load and a cross-departmental strategic response to ensure that the scale of these fires should never happen again.Cllr Clarke said it is important that police proactively investigate what are environmental crimes and those responsible need to be assured that these types of crime will not be tolerated in society.South Down MLA Sinead Ennis has also praised firefighters for their efforts in battling huge fires in the Mournes which started at Hen Mountain and Spelga Dam.She added: ldquoTragically, these fires will have caused widespread damage to the environment and our wildle. This is yet another stark reminder that everyone must behave responsibly while visiting the Mournes in order to protect the environment and the safety of the local community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Reality TV star Matthew visits ex primary school  ","story":"FRESH from Dancing With The Stars Ireland, TV star Matthew MacNabb and his new girlfriend took the chance to visit his former primary school last week.Matthew and his professional dance partner, Laura Nolan, visited St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Legamaddy, after making it to the semi-final of the top RTE show.The visit to the school, which the Downpatrickrsquos manrsquos brother and sisters also attended, coincided with the school celebrating news of receiving a sizeable grant.It has been awarded pound, which will go towards creating a pollinator garden in the school grounds.Pupils were delighted to show Matthew and Laura around the school, particularly its new outdoor learning hub which allows to have an outdoor classroom for eco projects.The schoolrsquos Eco teacher, Mrs Bronagh Reid, said the school was delighted to welcome Matthew back.ldquoHe was very friendly to all the pupils, who found him very inspiring, said Mrs Reid. ldquoIt was good that he called with us on a day off and it was down to his mother Margaret, who sits on our board of governors.ldquoWe were all hoping that Matthew would make into the final but very impressed that he cog to the semi-final.The schoolrsquos cash injection is part of the Rural Community Pollinator Grants Scheme, which is financed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand managed by the civic-pride campaign, Live Here Love Here.It is designed to allow community groups and schools across rural Northern Ireland to benefit from funding between pound, to pound, to establish, enhance or develop a local community pollinator garden.A pollinator garden is a shared space with pollinating plants, habitats, wildflowers, flowers, shrubs and trees, and the grants support new initiatives aimed at protecting and providing for pollinators.Mrs Sarah McDowell, principal, said: ldquoWe plan to use the money to create an outdoor learning space which will enhance our school grounds and the local community.ldquoWe will build an outdoor classroom and plant fruit trees to attract more wildle to our school grounds.`We are delighted to receive the support of Live Here Love Here to help us create this space which will benefit the children in our school and will help to improve bioersity in the area.She added: ldquoWe look forward to starting to create this area after Christmas and have it ready for the spring term.The pilot scheme, which made pound. million available for  , aims to cover % of costs to community groups and schools wishing to embark on the community environmental project.Successful grant applicants were required to illustrate their plans to maximise pollinator-friendly land-management techniques to increase the bioersity value of an area by planting for pollinators, and to transform unused spaces into valued community spaces, adding habitats and greening-up formerly grey areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Students involved in All Island lights switch off climate event  ","story":"THE lights went out at Stormont at the weekend thanks to ecologically aware local high school studentsA group of pupils from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and Down High School, who are involved in the All-Island Schools  Climate Action programme, asked for the lights at Stormont to be switched off for one hour on Saturday evening.Local MLAs Harry Harvey and Colin McGrath helped ensure that the request was fast-tracked, with Mr Harveyrsquos we, Sharon, doing a lot of the work behind the scenes.Mr Harvey met with staff and pupils from the two schools in the grounds of Parliament Buildings to observe the dimming of the lights.Stormont joined in solidarity with the  countries from around the world that participated in the th anniversary of the global Earth Hour.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Provision of Covid tests by government are changing.However free testing will persist in NI for some time yet subject, to some changes. Stormont Health Minister Robin Swann says that testing will continue to play a vital role in Northern Ireland’s response to COVID- over the coming months but that a “more targeted approach” will be introduced on a phased basis from April, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness.Under the new policy, PCR testing in NI will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop Covid symptoms.Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting, such as a care home, until the end of June, with a further review then.The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced in Northern Ireland until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June.The full range of changes to take effect from  April in Northern Ireland are as follows-* PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.* Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.* Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.* Routine asymptomatic testing - testing for those with no symptoms - will continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.* Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.* Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.* Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.* Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .* Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.”The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development.“As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.”The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Continue with six weeks holiday in the summer at least! We get the shortest summer break in the world. State should provide free affordable childcare.”Trena Wise said: “Four weeks would be better and spread the rest throughout the year.” This was agreed with by Lisa Gerrard.Trudi Thomas said: “Five weeks and an extra week off at Christmas.”Iulia Condurache said: “These kids need this.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe UN envoy, Hans Grundberg, announced the agreement from Amman, Jordan, after meeting separately with both sides in the country’s brutal civil war in recent days.He said that he hoped the truce would be renewed after two months.The agreement comes after a signicant escalation in recent weeks that saw Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels claim several attacks across the country’s borders, targeting the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. vw,vw,px, px\"Houthi supporters attend a rally marking the seventh anniversary of the Saudi-led coalition’s intervention in Yemen’s war in Sanaa The truce is to start on Saturday, the first day of Ramadan, and will also allow for shipments of fuel to arrive in the Yemen’s key port city of Hodeida and for passenger flights to resume from the airport in the capital, Sanaa.UN spokesperson Farhan Haq said the warring sides agreed to halt all offensive military, air, ground and maritime operations inside Yemen and across its borders, starting at pm on Saturday.The agreement came after the Saudi-led coalition, which has been battling the Houthis in Yemen since , began observing a unilateral ceasefire on Wednesday — an offer that was rejected by the rebels.Saudi Arabia had proposed the unilateral ceasefire as part of talks it hosted aiming to resolve the war in Yemen. But the Houthis did not attend the talks because they were held on neutral territory.Last Saturday, the Houthis also announced their own unilateral initiative that included a three-day suspension of cross-border attacks on Saudi Arabia, as well as fighting inside Yemen.Their announcement came shortly after they claimed attacks on a key Saudi oil facility in the Red Sea city of Jiddah, ahead of a Formula One race in the kingdom.On Friday, in a Twitter post, Mohammed Abdel-Salam, the spokesman and chief negotiator of the Houthis, welcomed the ceasefire..removeYemen’s war began in September , when the Houthis swept into the capital, Sanaa, from their north-western stronghold in the Arab world’s poorest country.The Houthis then pushed into exile the government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, elected in  as the sole candidate after the long rule of Ali Abdullah Saleh.A Saudi-led coalition, including the UAE, entered the war in March  to try and restore Mr Hadi’s government to power. But the war, which evolved into a proxy conflict, stretched into long bloody years, pushing much of Yemen’s people to the brink of famine.The United Nations and others had been pushing the coalition and rebels to stop the fighting for Ramadan, as has tenuously occurred in past years.“This is the result of fairly painstaking work” by Mr Grundberg and other diplomats, Mr Haq said. He said the envoy called the truce “a first and long-overdue step” toward ending the fighting that has killed more than , people, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project figures. That figure includes both fighters and civilians.During the two-month truce, the Saudi-led coalition will allow  vessels carrying fuel into the port of Hodeida, and two commercial flights a week from and to the Yemeni capital to Jordan and Egypt.After the truce takes effect, the UN envoy will call for both sides to convene to agree on opening roads around Taiz and other provinces, the document said.Taiz, which remains partially held by the forces fighting on behalf of the internationally recognized government, has been blockaded by the Houthis for years.There are hopes the truce could build momentum for further steps towards peace, though past attempts at ceasefires have repeatedly fallen through. The terms of this latest agreement bear a resemblance to a  peace deal that brought an end to fighting in Hodeida but failed to bring wider peace.The Iran-backed Houthis and Yemen’s internationally recognised government have also said they were working on a deal to release over , prisoners of war, including Mr Hadi’s brother and a former defence minister..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: UN says rival factions in Yemen agree to two-month truce article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We got slaughtered for celebrating a - draw but it was a great performance and I think it showed the potential of the young team.“Over the course of the qualying campaign, a really good performance and result against Denmark has shown that this team has really grown, and they have responded to the disappointment of not being able to get out of the group stages of the Euros.“It was always a worry, because we hadn’t been to a major tournament for so long, to get to the tournament and have a couple of games at Hampden and not really play as well as we know they can, but the response from the players and management has been outstanding..remove“The last game of the group against Denmark was such a strong performance. How far we have come, even in the space of six months, is remarkable, which gives us hope that it can be much further improvement come the play-off in June.”McFadden, who scored  goals for his country, added: “Now we are in a really good place, we have a strong squad, good options all over the pitch, and we go into these games in June with great confidence and optimism that we can get the job done. vw,vw,px, px\"Scotland’s James McFadden celebrates scoring against Moldova in  “And then again,all goes well, going into the World Cup in a really good place, with a strong squad, I think we will be in a much better position– and it’s a massive– we manage to qualy.“It will be tough but the big incentive is obviously to get to a World Cup, we haven’t been there since , and to top it all off, you get to play against England again in your group, which would be absolutely magnicent.“It’s a big enough incentive in itself to get to the World Cup but knowing that you’re going into a group again with England is great and I’m sure it will motivate the players going into those play-off games.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: James McFadden backs Scotland uabsolutely magnicent u England clash happens article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCriminal and civil investigations have been launched by the Insolvency Service into the circumstances surrounding PO’s decision to make the seafarers redundant on March .A legal duty for PO to hold consultations on the redundancies and whether the firm gave the Secretary of State due notice about its plans are among the areas that could be investigated.The Insolvency Service said that “as these are ongoing investigations, no further comment or information can be provided at this time”. vw,vw,px, px\"Peter Hebblethwaite answers questions in front of the Transport Committee and Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee No one knows what sort of fine or the scale of the sanction the firm could face but what is clear is the company is “banged to rights” on its failure to consult, according to the TUC.PO Ferries chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite told a joint hearing of the Commons’ business and transport committees that his company broke the law by not consulting with trade unions before sacking workers.He has also said that all vessels involved were registered outside the UK and the relevant authorities in each case had been notied.Employment lawyer Anita North, of Simpson Millar, said: “They could be investigated for not notying the Secretary of State about the fact they were going to make the redundancies but there are provisions in the legislation which say that the requirement depends on what the obligations are of the port in the country that the ship is registered.“Since these ships are registered outside of Britain, the obligation therefore falls with the jurisdiction of where they were registered.”On whether directors could be held liable, she said: “It is not clear there has been any wrongdoing or any financial dishonesty.“There is no suggestion of actual director dishonesty to give grounds for a criminal investigation. It is immoral I think, but ultimately there are no laws to say you cannot dismiss your employees without notice..remove“There are laws to say you should consult before you do that andyou don’t employees can claim a protective award but there are no sanctions as such that can be taken against iniduals.” vw,vw,px, px\"A demonstration against the dismissal of PO workers takes place outside the Port of Liverpool The TUC said it sees the dismissal of the  seafarers as an attempt by PO Ferries to “bypass” employment laws as bosses have “sought to impose the changes rather than negotiate them”.The union organisation said the plan was to replace seafarers on union-negotiated wages with low-paid agency staff thanks to gaping holes in the minimum wage rules as they apply to overseas workers on non-UK flagged vessels.PO may be investigated for failing to noty the Government in time but it is dficult to find previous examples of employers who have been hit with a punitive fine, Ms North and the TUC said.Companies can also face having to pay affected workers maximum protective awards of  days’ pay.It is possible that PO may have simply priced in the potential cost of such an award in its offer to dismissed seafarers, the TUC suggested.Ms North added: “I think it is part of a director’s duties to think about the financial viability of the company and do everything it can to ensure it does not go under but that should not just be from a personal point of view – there should be more consideration of how the decision being taken by the board affects the employees and not just the balance sheet.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: What sanctions could PO Ferries face for sacking  workers without notice  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Her hand-painted ‘Welcome to Banbridge’ mural in Newry Street celebrates the Brontë link to the area using typography inspired by the world’s most famous literary family.Artist Friz pays homage to the town’s most famous landmark and Europe’s first ever flyover, Downshire Bridge.

Inspired by the area’s linen history, Rob Hilken’s mural at Linenhall Street depicts damask linen with a Jacquard weaving pattern that was created by local linen mills. The chrysanthemum damask design used was created by William Liddell and incorporates the distinctive pattern found on Jacquard loom punch cards, which were used to create the complex damask designs that made the Banbridge area world-famous for its linen.Belfast-based artist and illustrator FGB’smural at Bridge Street celebrates the town’s association to Irish physicist Professor Ernest Walton who was educated at Banbridge Academy Preparatory School.

Dublin-based Decoy’s mural at Scarva Street celebrates Banbridge as a strategic river crossing point, a communication route between Belfast and Dublin and a focus for agricultural industry, trade and commerce. An ancient king’s road connecting Ulster to the rest of the island once crossed the Bann at a forging place a short distance downstream at Ballykeel.In addition to the new street art, one of Banbridge’s most iconic landmarks - a B-listed monument dedicated to Captain Crozier which memorialises his contribution to polar exploration - has undergone signicant restoration work.Holly Pereira on Newry Street.

With his ear for a good story and eye for detail, Jack, who founded the historical group in , takes readers on a mirthful trip down memory lane.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They gradually gained popularity with the audience and, being held on the Monday night before the annual May Fair Day, reflected the atmosphere of jollication that pervaded the town at this special time of year.An eye-catching image from Ballyclare.“The music was provided by ious groups of instrumentalists – fiddlers, accordionists, tin whistle players – and their sessions were interspersed with songs, recitations and stories by local inidual entertainers drawn from the lore and culture of the Six Mile Water region. Many of these songs and much of the material came from an oral tradition and few were available in written form.”Verses of material from local ‘balladeers’ Ernie Scott, Sandy Robinson, Jock Gilmour and Matt Meharg together with short biographical details of these and many others feature in the pages of the book.Jack continued: “Sadly the concerts came to an end when the security situation dictated that crowds gathering in halls became impossible. The Historical Society planned to celebrate the th anniversary of the founding of the society in  by reviving the Rhymes and Ructions concert in  but the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic put paid to their plans.”In his introduction to Rhyme and Ructions Jack, who is the author of a number of local history studies including ‘Stories of a Letime’, also reveals what inspired this latest publication.Author Jack McKinney with his latest publication.“What I am endeavouring to do here is to compile a collection of the ballads and anecdotes that proved so popular at the concerts. The tone and subjects of the ballads y considerably from the amusing to those of a more contemplative nature. As for their credibility I leave the readers to assess this for themselves.”Jack has pursued his interest in local history and its characters with zeal since retiring in  after a four-decade career as an assistant and principal teacher in east Antrim primary schools. The former Mossley Primary School pupil, taught at Abbots Cross, Ballyclare and Whitehead Primary Schools. And in the manner in which he inspired many pupils, Jack is keen to share his enthusiasm for knowledge with a whole new generation of readers.A founder member of the Ulster-Scots Language Society, Jack added: “The ballads are recorded in the style of language used in the originals – standard English or Ulster- Scots. The stories and other text may contain either or both. I have often followed the style of a mixture of Ulster -Scots and English as in the Scottish ‘Kaleyard’ novels, familiar to readers of Archibald McIlroy’s books, where the conversational dialogue of characters is in Ulster-Scots with the rest of the narrative in standard English.”The ‘Wreck of the Never Budge’, ‘Courting and Possible Consequences’ or ‘The May Fair and lots of Houzeldoo’ provide a hint of Ballyclare May Fairs past and possible inspiration for future balladeers and storytellers.

This increase will see the yearly gas bill of a typical household with a credit meter rise by about pound per year to pound,. Those customerswith a prepayment gas meterwill see costs increase by around pound per year to pound,. Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “It is important that consumers are made aware that their domestic gas bills will stay high for at least the next year because the wholesale price that the companies pay for the gas continues to be much more expensive than the norm. Unfortunately heating oil prices are also very high, so regardless of the fuel we use, many of us will experience extreme pressure on our household budgets. This will further increase the numbers of people in fuel poverty, as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “As the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme ends today , we implore firmus energy, and the wider energy industry, to commit to financially supporting the continuation of a fuel hardship scheme in the coming financial year. For the longer term, it is clear that energy companies, policy makers, the Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high energy prices will likely be with us for the foreseeable future.” Consumers who are struggling to pay their energy bills or struggling to pay to top-up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support.

We told you that the tree used to make ballot paper – Flora Plio – was in short supply. Of course there’s no such thing as a Flora Plio, which is an anagram of April Fool. Our paper production expert, Poppy Cox, was indeed a load of poppycock, and of course we couldn’t do an April Fool about paper without mentioning foolscap. And we had to make our ‘official’ statement at midday because,we hadn’t, we’d be the fools for carrying on!  The forthcoming election is set to be postponed for a fortnight due to insufficient amounts of the correct type of ballot paper, we understand. It is believed that the specic type of tree used to make the paper - Flora Plio – has been in short supply in recent months. Paper production expert, Poppy Cox, explained why this specic type of tree was used for the production of ballot papers. “It has a special waxy quality that prevents the mark you make on your ballot paper being rubbed out,” said Mrs Cox. “That obviously adds an added level of security to the elections and stops people claiming that their ballot has been changed.” Alternatives are now being sought and the two week delay in the vote will hopefully allow for the ballot to be printed on a dferent type of paper. “It is possible that we could see a special kind of foolscap being useda secure alternative can’t be found,” Mrs Cox added. An official statement on the matter is due to be made at midday today .  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebbcfffefbbbb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_abfcecffeaaabfcd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
