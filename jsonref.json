By November 1934, she writes that he is living in Berlin and has told her “he will stay indefinitely. He felt that for the present he really had found his spiritual home.”But the painter’s fleeting interest in Nazi regalia and nationalist ideology were just part of a wider picture in which chance encounters and odd accidents were welcomed by Bacon as a way to expand the imagination, according to Watson’s diary, which has been acquired by Francis Bacon’s estate, and is one of two revealing journals extracted in a new book, Inside Francis Bacon.Watson, who was one of the first people to buy Bacon’s paintings, travelled extensively with her charismatic cousin and listened with attention as he explained his feeling for Göring, for the iconography of crucifixion and for Emily Brontë’s unsettling novel Wuthering Heights. She also observed the growth of those dark and violent themes, such as crucifixion and masochism, that were to inspire Bacon’s work until his death in 1992 at the age of 82.“I had to include Watson’s Nazi references, along with his other interests at the time, because I am trying to be doggedly truthful,” said Martin Harrison, the Bacon expert and biographer who has edited passages of Watson’s diary for the new book, published by Thames and Hudson next month. “Every one of the things that shaped his paintings later was clearly being formulated back then. People have written of his ‘flirtation’ with fascism but it was not really that.” Harrison argues that Watson’s diaries show that the artist was ing into different worlds as a way to stimulate himself.“He loved the German uniforms. He wanted to be raped by these guys. I don’t deny anything about Bacon’s weird sexuality, if you want to call it that, but he was never really a fascist sympathiser. How could he be, as a gay man? It was a passing thing, and he moved away from all that,” said Harrison.Watson was an ambulance driver during the war but Harrison now suspects she also spied for the British government, as well as moving in bohemian circles with her cousin. She repeatedly admires the way Bacon was able to embrace the company of strangers, from any social background, and was as at home in a country house as a Lyons Corner House.“I feel very sympathetic to Diana,” Harrison said. “She seems to have worshipped Bacon then. She was from a well-off racing family and he offered her a way out of all that. She was quite racy, and I am pretty sure she worked for the secret services because she refers cryptically to her work going well at Berkeley Square. Well, she was certainly not working around there as couturier.”Watson also seems to have spotted the theory of random chance that went on to inform Bacon’s artistic philosophy. “She noticed his themes and obsessions emerging, like the idea of the crucifixion and the suffering he identified with. You are seeing it all through her take on Bacon, admittedly, and much of it is very staccato reminiscences, or has been rewritten, but she clearly supported and understood him,” he said.Perhaps the passages in Watson’s diary that illuminate his art the best, Harrison believes, are those showing his growing belief in fate. In a Tate Gallery catalogue for another artist’s show in 1953, Bacon explained his theory, in which “real painting is a mysterious and continuous struggle with chance”.In 1932, Watson writes: “He always had a feeling that miracles did happen. He was so accustomed to being carried along by chance”. A year later she writes:“F always had contacts by accident. On decks of ships, waiting-rooms of aerodromes, restaurants, backstage, Lyons – never going to a house.”These encounters were not all brief romances. One future friend and mentor he met on board a ferry was Eric Allden, who, like Watson, became infatuated with Bacon. His extensive diary entries are also in the book. But Harrison has not been able to solve one mystery. Watson indicates that Bacon stayed in Paris in his youth with an influential painter, who may have been Spanish, who seems to have had the initials PG: “I have been through the Paris directory with no luck. So £100 to the person who can work out who this painter was!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6e358ed2548012ffdf3ea85dda4d3bcbfea5630/0_311_5137_3084/master/5137.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34830f7e587a63db8903f94399e33333","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Black Lives Matter protests in Portland, the impact of Covid-19 around the world and the FA Cup semi-finals at an empty Wembley: the most striking photographs from around the world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31ecf6af4b53e398d1ada7276a96f6ddb2ff30fe/0_2_2485_1491/master/2485.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02ec7f06eeac9085deb4a261c35f9a7a","title":"playful origami using banknotes in pictures","story":"Yosuke Hasegawa has been making “money origami” for the past 14 years.

So why do we still treat parenthood as the default?When I think that it won’t hurt too much, I imagine the children I will not have. Would they be more like me or my partner? Would they have inherited my thatch of hair, our terrible eyesight? Mostly, a child is so abstract to me, living with high rent, student debt, no property and no room, that the absence barely registers. But sometimes I suddenly want a daughter with the same staggering intensity my father felt when he first cradled my tiny body in his big hands. I want to feel that reassuring weight, a reminder of the persistence of life.We are in the middle of a mass extinction, the first caused by a single species. There are 7.8 billion of us, on a planet that scientists estimate can support 1.5 billion humans living as the average US citizen does today. And we know that the biggest contribution any inidual living in affluent nations can make is to not have children. According to one study, having one fewer child prevents 58.6 tonnes of carbon emissions every year compare that with living car-free (2.4 tonnes), avoiding a transatlantic return flight (1.6), or eating a plant-based diet (0.82). Another study said it was almost 20 times more important than any other choice an environmentally minded inidual could make. Such claims have been questioned. After all, does a parent really bear the burden of their child’s emissions? Won’t our inidual emissions fall as technologies and lifestyles change? Isn’t measuring our inidual carbon footprint – a concept popularised by oil and gas multinational BP – giving a free pass to the handful of corporate powers responsible for almost all carbon emissions? The only thing that isn’t up for debate is that we all know that we are living in ways that can’t continue.Scientists have called this “jaw-dropping”, but others see it as an understandable consequence of the deepening, existential malaise so many of us currently feel a growing sense that accountability has been eroded, inequality is rampant, and that the profound structural changes we need to feel better about the future are out of our reach. So while governments focus on pronatalist policies, groups including Population Matters and Optimum Population Trust have reported a sharp uptick in interest in their advice, which is to only have one or two children, or none at all. More extreme groups like the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (motto: “May we live long and die out”) have entered mainstream conversation. New terms have been minted: “birthstrikers” refuse to procreate in the face of the existential threat of climate change. Antinatalists argue that bringing sentient life into the world is inherently cruel, as it is doomed to suffer some make headlines for suing their parents over their own existence. In the darker corners of the internet, ecofascists write screeds about issuing birth licences to those they deem worthy. But the most universally applicable term now is “child-free”: those who have voluntarily decided to not have kids (and so, are not child-“less”).Coronavirus isn’t likely to give us coronababies – but a pandemic isn’t the reason that having children has shifted from an inevitability to a choice, and now, a moral question. A long time ago, “Do we have children?” became “Should we?”In A Children’s Bible, a new novel by Lydia Millet, kids are contemptuous of adults for their lack of action before the collapse of society. “It was so sudden, they said. They’d all been told there was more time. Way more. It was someone else’s fault for sure.” One of the children, Jack, finds a decaying Bible, and in it, a way of making sense of his disintegrating world. When an apocalyptic storm hits the US, the book tells him what to do: build an ark.Few novels have attempted to tell us what to do in the face of climate catastrophe. Amitav Ghosh has called this “a crisis of imagination”. As Richard Powers writes in his 2018 novel The Overstory, “The world is failing precisely because no novel can make the contest for the world seem as compelling as the struggles between a few lost people.”But even when the future seems like no place for a child, there is always room for them in fiction set at the end of the world: they are emotional ammunition, a reminder of bigger stakes to come. In Lauren Beukes’s upcoming Afterland, a global pandemic that kills only men has lead to a “global reprohibition” Cole, a mother on the run with her mysteriously still-living teenage son, thinks: “When there aren’t going to be any more kids, you want to hold on to their childhood for as long as you can. There must be a German word for that. Nostalgenfreude. Kindersucht.”Perhaps it is kindersucht we feel when we read novels like The Children of Men by PD James, Future Home of the Living God by Louise Erdrich, or JG Ballard’s The Drowned World, in which children are conspicuous by their presence or absence. In Ballard’s 1962 novel, set in a submerged London, “the birth of a child had become a comparative rarity, and only one marriage in 10 yielded any offspring … the genealogical tree of mankind was systematically pruning itself.” In Margaret Atwood’s 1977 short story “When It Happens”, a middle-aged woman makes preparations to flee her family home due to an unnamed threat, and her gaze falls on a family photo: “The children when they were babies. She thinks of her girls now and hopes they will not have babies it is no longer the right time for it.” In Jenny Offill’s Weather, the narrator watches her son play and recalls a past conversation with an environmentalist friend: “I asked her once what I could do, how I could get him ready. It would be good if he had some skills, she said. And of course, no children.”Children become resigned to not having the future they should have had in Cormac McCarthy’s The Road, when the father says: “You are not the one who has to worry about everything”, his son counters, “I am the one.” And in Season Butler’s Cygnet, a teenager mopes around an island populated only by pensioners waiting out the end as their homes slowly crumble into the sea: “I think about the kids that people my age are having, or will start having soon. Life is going to be so boring for them. Not just because the world will have gone completely to shit by then and there won’t be much of anything left, but because their parents are going to talk constantly about how the world used to be.”In the real world too, children play a leading role: think of all the kids we’ve seen skipping school to hold signs on the news, or addressing world leaders for us at UN climate summits. It is tragic and effective, and why every book about the environment right now is written by parents. Naomi Klein’s This Changes Everything starts with her realisation that her toddler may never see a moose. Notes from an Apocalypse opens as Mark O’Connell sees a video of a starving polar bear and mourns for his son, who is happily watching a cartoon bear nearby. Jonathan Safran Foer’s We Are the Weather looks forward to the lives his children will inherit. In David Wallace-Wells’s The Uninhabitable Earth, he confesses to the “delusion” and “wilful blindness” involved in his decision to have his first child while writing it. And the title of James Hansen’s Storms of My Grandchildren says it all.All these books are well argued, emotive and interesting, but it is remarkable how many of these authors suggest that having a child is a hopeful gesture, a sign of one’s investment in the future. Wallace-Wells has said having children “is a reason to fight now”. O’Connell writes that his son’s birth is a dilemma because “the last thing the world needed, after all, was more people in it, and the last thing my hitherto nonexistent person needed was to be in the world” by the end, he has a second child, and a “radically increased stake in the future”. Klein writes that, before having her son, she “couldn’t help feeling shut out” by activists talking about their children and grandchildren, and wonders: “Was it even possible to be a real environmentalist if you didn’t have kids?” (Yes.) If you don’t, it is seen as fatalism. “Are we then expected to hasten the end, to succumb at last to the logic of oblivion, by renouncing the biological imperative?” asks O’Connell. (No.)So, we continue to place our hopes in children, even the ones that don’t yet exist, to save us. Lee Edelman calls this “reproductive futurism” in his book No Future it is that child, “the fantasmic beneficiary of every political intervention”, that people feel inspired to fight for, the one people mean when they say to women like me: “But what if your child was the one to solve climate change?”As Sheila Heti writes in Motherhood: “I resent the spectacle of all this breeding, which I see as a turning away from the living – an insufficient love for the rest of us, we billions of orphans already living.” And as Greta Thunberg told us all last year: “You all come to us young people for hope. How dare you.”When asked why I do not have children, I have given various explanations over the years. “It is a complex situation” is vague enough to make most interrogators look ashamed for having asked. If I say, “I am worried about the environment”, parents often tell me in hushed tones that they have wondered whether their children will be able to have children too. (In my meanest moments, I think: “Really? How hard did you think about that?” And then I feel a deep, sour sense of shame, because I have a choice in the matter and rightfully, so do they.) But “I don’t want to” is the only answer that provokes a flinch.Countless studies have found that people consider child-free adults unnatural and cold. Women bear this burden particularly hard Theresa May and Nicola Sturgeon have been forced to share miscarriages and infertility the former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard was once criticised for being “deliberately barren”. Last year, I wrote a news story about Paul Dolan’s book Happy Ever After, which contained some research about child-free people being just as happy as parents. Subsequently, complete strangers called me a “stupid bitch”, a “feminist cancer”. One Instagram account uploaded a picture of me where thousands of men discussed how unfuckable I was more than one messaged to tell me that my mother wished I had never been born. When I read this, I thought of my mother, who had me as a teenager and could give them a brisk, pitiless history of all the people like them who treated her terribly for having had a child. (If you still don’t think this is a gendered debate, I ran into Dolan a day later, and asked him how he was coping. “What abuse?” he asked.)Still, my generation continues desperately to hunt for things to do in the face of the greatest catastrophe some of us (or our children) may live to see. We give up meat and take holidays closer to home, even when we know that if the super-rich cut their emissions to that of the average EU citizen, global emissions would drop by a third. But we can’t make anyone else do anything, so we do what we can, and we justify our choices as being meaningful, bigger than us.Ever since my partner and I concluded that we wanted to be child-free, I have looked to books for positive examples of fulfilling and rewarding lives lived without children. The closest I have found have been eccentric spinsters and ambivalent parents, in a long line from Doris Lessing and DH Lawrence, Barbara Pym and Rachel Cusk. There are countless mothers who find their intellectual pursuits strangled by their children and absent husbands (most recently, Fleishmann Is in Trouble by Taffy Brodesser-Akner and Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan quartet).But recently, as millennials are coming of age as both prospective parents and as authors, characters are questioning the status quo. “Fuck all those childbearers and their ‘fulfilling’ lives, never getting to have adventures like mine,” thinks the 38-year-old narrator of Melissa Broder’s The Pisces, for whom the prospect of children is “like something mildly distasteful: a piece of onion I would prefer not to put on my plate”. “Why bother having a kid when the world’s going to hell anyway?” wonders one character in Ottessa Moshfegh’s A Year of Rest and Relaxation. “Why do you want children?” the narrator of Avni Doshi’s Burnt Sugar asks her boyfriend. “He shrugs. ‘So we can be like everybody else.’” In Amina Cain’s Indelicacy, a woman objects to her husband’s expectation that they will someday have children. “Why is it necessary for everyone to think of it, as if there were no other choice?” she rages at a friend.The climate crisis has presented an opportunity to rebrand being child-free, once the greatest taboo, into the ultimate altruistic act. At the same time, parenthood is framed as the ultimate investment in a better future. But choosing to have children is neither inherently good nor selfish, and the same goes for being child-free. We must challenge the orthodoxy that says choosing to live one way is a criticism of another. Just this week comes a new novel by Emma Gannon, Olive, which centres on a woman in her 30s who has chosen to be child-free Gannon herself has spoken about being made to feel guilty for her choice. What we need instead is a quiet revolution, a complete reappraisal of what we deem to be a meaningful life. I, for one, will continue to turn to books, where I find reassurance in the strangest of places. In one tiny strand of The Overstory, Ray and Dorothy, a couple who have spent thousands on fertility treatments, finally decided to move on. “In place of children, then, books,” Powers writes. “Ray likes to glimpse the grand project of civilisation ascending to its still-obscure destiny. He wants only to read on, late into the night, about the rising quality of life, the steady freeing of humanity by invention, the breakout of know-how that will finally save the race.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/faef80c9ece0ec148b6e588dece27eb024035fd6/0_215_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a636823a14c19726b6554b746ffa7910","title":"adrian tomine loneliness long distance cartoonist","story":"It’s safe to say the US cartoonist is ambivalent about his own success. His latest book charts the everyday humiliations of his trade in hilarious detailAs a novelist of my acquaintance once observed, writers tend mostly to moan about their humiliations – the book signing for which no one turned up the festival at which they could barely be heard over the sound of the audience cheering a more famous author in the bigger tent next door – to each other. Even as they flinch at the memory, they know in their hearts that there are worse things in life than mistaking the snaking line of bodies at an event for your own fans when in fact they’re Neil Gaiman’s, even if your new girlfriend was there to witness the pitifully brief flaring of your excitement. As their non-writer motherssistersfriends will inevitably remind them should they be tempted to complain that they overheard someone slagging off their book in a pizza joint (“pure writers’ workshop bullshit…”), sweetie, at least the guy read it.But this doesn’t mean that these things aren’t, in the right hands, delicious to read about. In his latest book, The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Cartoonist, Adrian Tomine turns himself into the everyman of writerly mortification, cataloguing all of the above indignities and many more besides in such brilliant and toe-curling detail that, post-pandemic, you can imagine publicists quietly placing it in the hotel bedrooms of touring authors, the better that they might find succour among its pages late at night. The readers who like to politely inform him (“I don’t mean this as a critique”) that his work is derivative the writers who blithely refer to his “little” pictures the “fans” who mistake him for his fellow cartoonist Daniel Clowes. Here they all are, though quite how cathartic drawing them has been remains a moot point. “Like all my work, this is an attempt to make my life not feel so useless,” he says, without too much conviction, when he speaks to me via Zoom from his home in New York.Tomine is “slightly enjoying” the disruption caused by coronavirus to the promotion of his book. “Normally, I would be travelling and reliving a lot of the things I’ve documented in it. But not this time. When my tour was cancelled, I had maybe one day of disappointment before I realised how perfect it was that this had happened.” The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Cartoonist speaks, he thinks, to the way the culture surrounding cartoons in particular, and books in general, has changed in recent years, a culture that still bemuses him: “Our parents’ generation read tons of comics, say, in the newspapers, without ever giving a thought to the people who were creating them, and I thought that was what I was getting into. Twenty years ago, this seemed like the one job where I would never have to get up on stage or speak in front of an audience it seemed like the surest path to being a hermit. But while the idea of achieving fame as a cartoonist is still absurd, it’s also tantalisingly in reach now – and somehow, that sets you up for even greater indignities.”Everything in the book happened, he says, even the bit where he has to lock himself in a bathroom for 30 minutes while his date waits outside (I’d better not expand on this here). Nevertheless, he was keen to add to the verisimilitude both by making his drawings much less controlled than in his last book (the bestselling short story collection, Killing and Dying) and by insisting that, once complete, The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Cartoonist would resemble a Moleskine notebook, complete with squared paper and pencil-scribbled author bio. “A comic book can be such a range of things now,” he says. “Some of those I enjoy most have a sketchbook quality, one that takes advantage of the fact that it’s a medium in which one crazy person just puts their brain on paper.” It’s helpful not to be too slick, he thinks. A big part of his process nowadays is a mind game in which he attempts to trick himself into feeling as he did when he was making comics as a boy in Sacramento, work he was sure that no one would ever see: “That creativity got inhibited as the years went by.”Tomine, whose academic parents were born in Japanese-American internment camps during the second world war, began drawing his comic, Optic Nerve, as a teenager by the time he was 21, and an English student at Berkeley, it was being published by Drawn \u0026amp Quarterly (he’s now 46). Nevertheless, it still amazes him that he was able to turn his beloved hobby into a living. However wonderful it is to design New Yorker covers – “I’ve never been more grateful that I could say that I was a cover artist for the New Yorker than when I was starting to get to know my in-laws,” he tells me, with laugh – cartoons will always be his first love and he will always feel protective about them, if not proprietorial, exactly. “The expansion of the comics world has benefited me,” he says. “And I love the idea that I’m not the weird dad at my kids’ school, which I once might have been. But sometimes I have the feeling that recognition and money and movie adaptations don’t always improve the quality of the artform. It’s not about TV shows or finding fame on the internet. The best comics are always going to be made by eccentric outsiders – people who feel that their work is absolutely necessary to them.”• The Loneliness of the Long Distance Cartoonist by Adrian Tomine is published by Faber \u0026amp Faber (£16.99).

The roads are getting busier, pubs are open again, and people are slowly returning to the high street as summer rolls on.It would be normal after a year in power for a prime minister to lay it on thick about their achievements in the last 12 months. But after four months of crisis inflicted by the pandemic, Johnson’s achievements in the past year will always be coloured by Covid-19.Progress on the promises he made on the steps of Downing Street a year ago remain minimal. Levelling up is still no more than a phrase, social care is not fixed, Brexit is not done. Many voters would give the prime minister a pass on these issues during a global health emergency. But as the summer months provide distance from the initial shock, and as the government attempts to shift gear from crisis management to the recovery phase of the outbreak – with the prime minister promising to “build back better” – patience will be tested.This week will mark one of the biggest tests yet in the drive to get the country going again. From Saturday, the government will begin to scale back its furlough scheme – the biggest single economic intervention of the crisis, which has benefited 9.5m jobs so far. Businesses will be asked to stump up some of their own money to keep staff on furlough. Funds are due to be entirely removed by October, in a carrot-and-stick approach to encourage Britain back to work.With town and city centres still quiet – despite gradual increases in the numbers of shoppers – employers will also be asked to return staff to offices from the start of next week if they feel it safe to do so. For once, the message from a government that has so often muddled its communications is clear: Britain is exiting the crisis phase. It is time to get back to normal.But in the headlong rush, the government plan to get the country going again has severe deficiencies. What’s worse, is that the biggest deficiencies are also those at the heart of the prime minister’s pre-Covid agenda. In particular, the challenge to level-up Britain’s lopsided economy.As the government attempts to move on from the crisis phase, a damning report from the Commons public accounts committee last week warned that local authorities are at increasing risk of running out of money. Councils are at the eye of the storm in the recovery phase of the pandemic. Some places have been hit harder than others in the economic crash triggered by lockdown, and will require greater support. The prospect of local lockdown restrictions also means greater funding support is required in these areas. But a funding settlement from Westminster of sufficient scale has not been made.Johnson’s government had promised resources would be made available, but many local authorities are facing income shortfalls and a dramatic rise in demand for their services as the economic damage unfolds.The plan in Westminster is to draw up a comprehensive solution for local areas to help them bounce back, using the chancellor’s spending review to develop a fresh funding settlement. But local authorities can’t wait for the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to run the rule over local authority funding in a process that is due to complete this autumn. Councils need clarity now so they can plan and prioritise future spending.The urgency of the task will be further exposed this week in a raft of reports from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. To be published in its quarterly economic review on Wednesday, Britain’s oldest economics research body warns that extreme levels of regional inequality can drag down the country’s overall economic growth. If the government is serious about levelling up and escaping the deepest recession in history while embedding sustainable growth for the future, tackling this issue head-on is vital.In a raft of papers, the analysis shows that Britain has a hyper-centralised state structure, with too much power concentrated in Westminster. Local authorities, it finds, have among the lowest levels of revenue-raising and spending powers within the OECD, - falling below both Romania and Ukraine.For decades this inequality has been allowed to develop, with the worst of the damage done amid the dismantling of Britain’s manufacturing base in the 1980s, just as a bonfire of financial regulation allowed the City of London to boom – fuelling a gulf between London and the rest of the country, particularly former industrial heartlands. Councils have been left unable to invest in their local areas – fostering regional inequality and crimping national growth.Repairing the damage was rising rapidly up the agenda prior to Covid-19, but since the onset of the crisis, it has taken on a new importance. According to the NIESR research, devolving power and allowing greater alignment between local government spending and taxation could boost the returns to public investment.As the government unwinds the furlough scheme, low-income workers that have been among those protected most by the wage subsidy programme will be at the greatest risk of unemployment.

Some of us will miss the age of the automobileThe past few months showed us something that many thought we’d never see in our lifetimes: empty roads. Miles of asphalt without a single vehicle to spoil the view. Parked cars gathered dust, multi-storeys were deserted and garages shuttered. As lockdown eased, cars started to fill our streets again. But the great hiatus provided a glimpse into an alternative future.Some cities, such as Milan, have already stated that they want to make permanent the changes brought about by the pandemic, and there have been calls across Britain for more space for walking and cycling. The warning lights signalling the end of the car’s total dominance over the way we travel and the way we plan cities are now flashing.For the past 15 years, I have been the Observer’s motoring editor. Like so many other things, the pandemic brought my weekly column to a juddering halt. Though environmental concerns also played a factor in its demise, it’s hard to review cars if you can’t drive anywhere, despite the temptation of those blissfully empty roads. What does looking back over 15 years of reviewing cars tell me about motoring’s next chapter? The automobile has dramatically transformed our lives since its invention. Steam-powered and even hydrogen-driven automobiles can be dated to the 1770s, but 1886 is generally regarded as the “birth year” of the modern motor. That was when Karl Benz patented his first Motorwagen. There are now 1.3bn cars on the world’s roads. In terms of captivating design coupled with brilliant technology, the last half-century has surely been the car’s golden age. If you regard motor manufacturing as an artform, these past decades will be seen as the automobile’s high mark, its Renaissance era, as one game-changing advance was piled on another. But a glance in your rearview mirror will tell you that this period will also be known as the last time cars could be driven with a clear conscience, a time of motoring innocence before driving became so compromised freighted with the knowledge that these beautiful machines were wrecking our planet.Guilt has never made for an amenable passenger, and the pumping soundtrack of a gurgling V8 soon starts to sound like a death rattle.I’ve loved cars for as long as I can remember. My mother has a picture of me as a toddler sitting on my potty, knock-kneed and in red sandals, earnestly parking my fleet of colourful Dinky toy cars. I then grew up and through my job found myself at the wheel of the real-life versions of the same models I’d been playing with. As a journalist, I drove everything from the first Series 1 1948 Land Rover Defender, with its famous registration plate HUE 166, to the last Jaguar E-Type to roll off the production line in Coventry in 1974. I drove around Le Mans in a vintage 1954 racing car with the grandson of William Lyons, the founder of Jaguar. I drove a one-off futuristic VW prototype with consumption figures so low you could go from London to Edinburgh on little more than a sip of fuel.There were Minis and Mondeos, Fiats and Ferraris, MPVs, SUVs, ATVs… I remember thinking it was funny to take an Aston Martin to a McDonald’s drive-thru, only to see there was a Lamborghini in the queue behind me. I took our household rubbish to the council tip in a Rolls-Royce – and was cheered by the workers there.I’ve long been dazzled by the car’s mechanical mastery of the multiple threats of travelling at speed with a tank of highly flammable liquid in the back. I’m amazed you can drive in comfort over frozen tundra or across a scorching desert with your paint job remaining immaculate through a swing of 60C. Why doesn’t it all just flake off? Cars give us limitless freedom. They’re our escape pods, parked on permanent standby. So what’s going to happen to them now? The next generation of motorists will see transformative technology once again reinvent vehicles. But how quickly will it happen? Will we soon be driven by fleets of self-piloted zombie cars? When autonomous cars finally become the norm, a point which is nowhere near as tantalisingly close as some suggest, one of the biggest changes will be the reduction in the number of fatal accidents. It will become almost impossible to die in a crash. It won’t just be lives that are saved, either. Autonomy will create efficiencies in many ways. These vehicles won’t be owned – we will rent them by the hour or day, which means we won’t need so many. and our streets won’t be so clogged with underused cars. Traffic lights, road signs and markings will become unnecessary – the cars know where they are going. Our cities will be quieter and cleaner. Our built environment will be less dominated by the infrastructure of the road.The elderly, infirm and even visually impaired will be able to enjoy driving without depending on taxis or other people. Autonomous cars will be far more energy efficient, too. Some studies estimate that fuel use will fall by at least a quarter.It all sounds pretty good, but this auto-utopia is still a long way from reality. There are so many obstacles to overcome. First up there is cost. Superfast sensors, lasers and cameras don’t come cheap. Then there is safety. On average, a vehicle in the UK is involved in a fatal crash once in every 200 million miles. This gives you a clue as to the phenomenal scale of testing that autonomous systems will have to undergo before we as humans will be prepared to hand over the steering wheel to a computer.What about insurance? If there is a crash, who and what is responsible? The mapping providers? The GPS system? The robo-pilot? Will our premiums drop? What about our no-claims bonus?In theory, any car can be modified to be self-driving. But for some reason, we tend to pair autonomy with electric vehicles. Battery technology, despite being around for more than a century, is still in its infancy. As the uptake of electric cars increases so their power packs will become smarter, more productive and more efficient. The lack of fast chargers and anxiety over range will cease to be an issue. Clearly, we are in dire need of more public charging points, and the uptake of electric vehicles won’t truly get into its stride without the installation of thousands of easy-to-access charge sites across the UK. But a lack of petrol stations didn’t stop Henry Ford rolling out his world-beating Model T. He once famously said: “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”A ban on all new sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2035 will focus our minds. But how ethical and sustainable is the production of an EV? The manufacture of the cars – and particularly the essential minerals for the batteries, often mined in countries with poor environmental records and even worse abuses of their labour force – is anything but green. Swapping an internal combustion engine for an electric motor is only a short-term fix. Are we, in fact, just kicking our problems down the street?Of all the scenarios about what we’ll be driving in the coming years, the one I find most plausible is that many of us will actually choose not to drive at all. In some ways, it’ll be a relief. Commuter constipation, motorway standstills and city gridlock all mean that driving now is often just a frustrating nightmare.Before the lockdown, Birmingham – once, proudly, the UK’s “motorway city” – had already announced plans to entice people out of their cars and on to bikes and buses, and on to their feet. If Birmingham goes ahead, it will join areas of York, Bath, Sheffield, Leeds, Edinburgh and Brighton among others, which have already experimented with car-free days. Bristol has announced plans to ban diesel soon.Further afield, Madrid has banned older cars from its centre, and Paris is following a similar route. The sustainable transport charity Sustrans estimates that of the 6.8 million private vehicle trips that were made daily in Greater London, 4.2 million could be walked or cycled.It’s ironic that the answer to all our car problems might be as simple as more of us turning off our engines, getting out – and simply using our own legs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e184512f2ed6068be7a21611048799d951b2a54/0_291_4961_2977/master/4961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de47001ae7c65bde1142378501e10925","title":"20 must see documentaries to explain the world in 2020","story":"From climate change and Black Lives Matter to Tiger King and Taylor Swift, these are the factual films that best capture and explain what’s going on around us It’s a must-watch because… An ongoing scandal of unchecked power and abuse is explored with emotional urgency.This four-hour inquiry from Netflix, currently lapping its competitors in the non-fiction miniseries department, is surely not the last documentary we’ll see on the late American financier and his horrific history of underage sexual abuse. After all, it’s a story that is still unfolding, with his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell recently taken into custody. But there’s power in being the first, and Lisa Bryant’s project – which entered production, securely under wraps, while Epstein was still alive – valuably amplifies the voices of victims who were unheard for too long.After 25 years as a showrunner and producer, Lisa Bryant’s first documentary series as a director was\u0026nbspJeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,\u0026nbspwhich premiered on Netflix in May. Originally based on James Patterson’s 2016 book of the same name, the four-parter developed the story of Epstein’s life, his court cases, and his death.Why did you decide to make\u0026nbspFilthy Rich?To show how our justice system was broken, expose Epstein’s abuse of wealth and power, and most importantly, to give the survivors a platform to get their voices heard.When did you start working on\u0026nbspit?Long before Epstein was arrested and dead, when he was still powerful, wealthy and intimidating, in November 2018.What problems did you have getting it made?We had to get a private room locked in our production offices for interviews, and encrypted communications to make sure no one hacked in. We had to protect everything we had, then the story started changing overnight.And it’s still changing. How did you react to Ghislaine Maxwell’s arrest?I hope our documentary played some part in putting pressure on the FBI to act quickly. Ghislaine will be the first of many arrests.Do you think\u0026nbspPrince Andrew\u0026nbspwill speak?It’s interesting that the US is saying “We’re asking him for answers”, and he’s saying “I’m offering them up, but no one wants them”. I hope for the women’s sakes he does offer answers. I don’t know if he’ll ever fully come clean, but I think the survivors would still respect him if he spoke to the FBI.What can’t you live without while you’re working?Good co-workers, and two cups of coffee before 10am, or else I get a headache!How would you sell documentary films to someone who says they’re not into factual films?I’d tell them documentaries use lots of techniques from other films, so are more intriguing and entertaining than one would think.What has stayed with you since you finished\u0026nbspFilthy Rich?Survivors saying how being involved has changed their lives for the better. It’s especially gratifying when it’s people that hadn’t spoken before. One woman started a Facebook group for Epstein survivors.What do you think about the current state of the documentary industry?It’s a very good storytelling time. Documentaries now start worldwide conversations.A must-watch because…The Black Lives Matter movement has put James Baldwin on everyone’s reading list: this doc perfectly complements his writing.It’s a couple of years since Haiti-born filmmaker Peck won a Bafta, and earned an Oscar nomination, for this fervid, fiery tribute to James Baldwin – but with the black American author’s work surging in popularity amid the BLM protests, it feels due another celebration. This isn’t a drably standard biographical documentary: instead, it engages imaginatively with Baldwin’s political ideas and convictions, emerging as a rousing work of activism in its own right.A must-watch because… A sports documentary that builds into a rousing celebration of a black icon.Even people who aren’t especially into basketball – which, in Britain, is admittedly rather a lot of the population – got hooked on this “10-part documentary event” surveying the extraordinary sporting legacy of Michael Jordan. And yes, “event” is Netflix’s own wording: there’s little room for modesty in a series that nominally covers the ups and downs of Jordan’s career, but concentrates most exhilaratingly on the ups: it’s hard not to get caught up in the stakes of his final season with the Chicago Bulls.A must-watch because… Its depiction of social tensions and restrictions under quarantine feel weirdly of the moment.One for the “stranger than fiction” file: viewers who followed the news in the early 1990s might recall the hype around Biosphere 2, an elaborate environmental project constructed in Arizona, intended to be a fully self-sufficient ecosystem, all contained under glass. (Biosphere 1, if you’re wondering, is Earth itself.) Eight people volunteered to spend two years in its confines: Matt Wolf’s slick, absorbing documentary charts the fallout of a project that was equal parts worthy eco-hippie research, peculiar cult and Big Brother prototype.Directors: Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering Multiple platformsA must-watch because…No documentary has so powerfully connected the causes of #MeToo and Black Lives Matter.The #MeToo movement has yielded a number of documentaries, but a strikingly intersectional perspective makes this searing account of sexual abuse in the hip-hop industry – as articulated by the women who tell of being sexually abused by Def Jam Records chief Russell Simmons – a landmark. (Simmons has denied all accusations.) Dick and Ziering’s film is candid about the particular difficulties black women have faced in coming forward with their stories. Former executive producer Oprah Winfrey controversially withdrew her backing from the film days before its Sundance premiere, but that hasn’t dimmed its critical and audience acclaim.A must-watch because…As far-right, anti-LGBTQ politics spread across Europe, here’s a terrifying glimpse of them in action.His films How to Survive a Plague and The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson established David France as the foremost docmaker in the field of LGBTQ history. His latest, however, is a gripping present-tense affair, documenting the state-sanctioned purge of gay people in the Chechen Republic. Using groundbreaking face-morphing technology to protect the identities of participating victims, France’s film tracks the efforts of a Russian activist group to extract vulnerable people from the country and shepherd them to safety: it’s an escape thriller with perilously high human stakes.David France is an American investigative reporter, nonfiction author and director of the Oscar-nominated documentary\u0026nbspHow to Survive a Plague. His new film is Welcome to Chechnya.What\u0026nbspcan documentary film-making\u0026nbspdo that journalism can’t?It can reflect not just fact but emotion, in a way that is really unmatched by any other kind of nonfiction storytelling.Do you consider yourself first a journalist, film-maker or activist?Journalist first. I don’t consider myself an activist. For years I have wanted to understand what motivates people to be activists. There’s something that makes them run toward a problem, where the rest of us might run away from it. It is their work that audiences react to. I am merely the person who carries their stories out to a larger universe.What do you think is the greatest documentary ever made?Honeyland. It’s a story about the natural world, the tragedy and chaos of modernity, and the survival of the heart.\u0026nbsp I’ve seen it a dozen times maybe.A must-watch because…“The UK is not innocent” has been a popular rallying cry of recent Black Lives Matter protests: this doc tells us why.As Britain continues to grapple with the national shame of the Windrush scandal – which recently saw thousands of legally settled, Caribbean-born UK residents threatened with deportation – this BBC documentary, written and presented by David Olusoga, delves into the roots of the institutional racism that caused it, exposing the “hostile environment” associated with Theresa May as a political objective preceding her by several generations. It’s suitably enraging stuff, but its emotional pull is enriched by a wealth of thorough, knotty historical detail.Produced by Keith Scholey and Alastair FothergillA must-watch because…Some climate-change docs can be on the dour side, but this offers a bright, accessible conversation starter on the subject.For many of us, it feels as if David Attenborough has narrated our entire life in some capacity. That voice is a reassuring brand in itself, making us listen more attentively to the specifics of his nature documentaries than we might do otherwise, particularly with such reliably ravishing visuals to contend with. That’s of particular value in his high-gloss Netflix series made last year, given its particular focus on climate change as propagated by humans and experienced by all organisms.A must-watch because…A ferocious study of racial oppression in American prisons made waves in 2016, and is still vital in Trump’s America.Another Bafta winner that just missed Oscar gold, Ava DuVernay’s first documentary feature after a trio of career-boosting narrative films is ostensibly about racial injustice in the prison system, but emerges as an expansive, furious view of the collective psychology that keeps archaic racial hierarchies in place across America. The title refers to the 13th amendment, which tweaked the abolition of slavery to permit involuntary servitude for convicted criminals: for many in America, DuVernay suggests, prison is slavery. Her argument is radical and persuasive.A must-watch because…Transgender rights are a sticking point even for many self-described liberals: this tender, straight-talking doc has the power to change perceptions.“The Dad Who Gave Birth” is the subtitle often tacked onto Jeanie Finlay’s study of transgender pregnancy, striking a blunt, tabloid-y note that doesn’t square with the film’s own delicate, humane approach. But yes, that’s the story in a nutshell, as the film documents trans man and  journalist Freddy McConnell’s struggle to conceive and deliver his own child. Finlay covers the social, emotional and medical complications of this process in candid but unsensationalised detail.Directors: Rebecca Chaikin and Eric Goode NetflixA must-watch because…A wild ride any way you slice it, this is documentary-making for the post-truth era, inviting us to decide how we consume and believe its information.Yes, this compulsive Netflix miniseries – a viral obsession in the early days of lockdown – is unabashed trash, to the extent that it’s being adapted into a narrative film starring Nicolas Cage. Viewers got hooked on the lurid tale of eccentric gay zookeeper and convicted felon Joe Exotic and his escalating feud with conservationist Carole Baskin critics expressed increasing scepticism over the film’s pile-up of tall stories and allegations, presented in equal, credulous fashion for the internet to pore over.A must-watch because…A rare female perspective on the Syrian civil war, the worst humanitarian crisis of our age.The Syrian conflict has inspired a steady stream of documentaries on its fighters and casualties – most of them can hardly fail to be moving, but it takes a unique point of view to cut through the numbing noise. The most-nominated documentary in Bafta history, this has that: taking the form of a video diary by co-director Al-Kateab as she weathers the conflict in Aleppo over six years, first as a student and eventually as a young mother, it’s an extraordinary ground-level chronicle.Directors: Tamara Kotevska and Ljubomir Stefanov Multiple platformsA must-watch because…A poetic allegory for the war between traditional and modern agriculture that doesn’t hit you over the head.Rightly showered with awards on the festival circuit last year, finally culminating in an Oscar nomination, this is environmental docmaking of a subtle, artful order, marrying ecological concerns with rich, close-up human character study. It follows Hatidze Muratova, an ageing, independent beekeeper living in the remote Macedonian mountains, as she finds her ecosystem threatened by a neighbouring Turkish family with brasher honey-gathering ambitions: warm, funny and exquisitely photographed, it invites us to consider what we give the land we take from.A must-watch because…Taylor Swift is among the most ubiquitous celebrities of this era: here’s an insight into what that means, for her and for us.If you’re not a devotee of all-American pop goddess Taylor Swift, you might wonder what’s to be gained from a documentary covering her life and labours over the course of recording her last two albums. But Lana Wilson’s Sundance-premiered documentary isn’t mere fan service: it’s a fascinating glimpse into the construction and deconstruction of celebrity in the Instagram era, covering Swift’s transition from carefully managed blank slate to politically outspoken liberal. Oh, and the music is pretty good too.A must-watch because…Unusual as a story of male victimhood in the #MeToo reckoning, it prompts uncomfortable questions about trauma, and who gets to control it.As storytelling, this harrowing British documentary is best viewed with as little advance knowledge as possible. Yet a trigger warning is in order for what emerges, through its tricky structure, as a tale of horrifying childhood abuse, shrouded in conflicting layers of memory and misinformation. At the centre of it are now middle-aged twin brothers Alex and Marcus Lewis, the former afflicted with amnesia following a teenage motorbike accident, the latter having taken charge of his brother’s memories in surprising ways.A must-watch because…You won’t see a more pointed inquiry into religious freedom at the moment – or a funnier one.The question mark in Penny Lane’s puckish, perceptive, sometimes riotous documentary about the Satanic Temple and its followers in the US may seem like a trollish affectation, but there’s a reason for it: by the time it’s finished, what these self-styled satanists stand for isn’t as clear-cut as you might think. Lane seeks the lighter, more humane side of a dark movement, but also a politically canny one: devil worship here emerges principally as a weapon in a culture war against the Christian right.Directors: Karim Amer and Jehane Noujaim NetflixA must-watch because…While we’re still living with the consequences of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, this is the clearest primer on how it all went down.We’re still awaiting a definitive documentary on the whole national catastrophe of the Brexit referendum, but this engrossing Netflix effort offers essential insight into the adjacent matter of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Centred on whistleblower Brittany Kaiser, academic David Carroll and Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, the film overlaps their observations and experiences to unpack the far-reaching influence of the data research company, from Brexit to the last US presidential election and beyond.A must-watch because…It gives human dimension to the cold statistics around the refugee crisis.We’ve seen a lot of documentaries in recent years about the European refugee crisis, but few as personally invested as Afghan film-maker Hassan Fazili’s riveting first-hand account of his own family’s gruelling escape from Afghanistan. As they trek overland from one European country to the next in search of asylum, facing violence and exploitation along the way, Fazili shoots their epic journey on a series of smartphone cameras: in addition to its emotional power, the film demonstrates the medium’s rapidly expanding technical possibilities.A must-watch because… A hard-hitting cautionary tale of the far-right takeover in Brazil – with international resonance.A global wave of sympathy didn’t exactly greet the recent news that far-right Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro had tested positive for coronavirus Petra Costa’s chilling, beautifully constructed account of his rise to power won’t warm your heart any. In one respect, it’s a dense, impassioned explanation of a political swing that’s been difficult to follow merely from headlines, but there’s universal resonance here too: the fractious public mood evoked here will be recognisable to residents of Trump’s America or Boris Johnson’s Britain.Petra Costa is a Brazilian director whose films blur personal narratives and documentary. Her Oscar-nominated\u0026nbspThe Edge\u0026nbspof Democracy\u0026nbsptraces the\u0026nbspcollapse\u0026nbspof the political system in her home country, and reflects on her family on either side of the political ide. Costa is currently working on\u0026nbspDystopia, about the Covid-19 outbreak in Brazil.Was the film a story for\u0026nbspBrazil, or for an international audience?Reading British people’s accounts of their psychological state after Brexit – a few months after the protest I filmed – was when I finally understood what I was feeling. People of my generation feel groundless. The same happened after the election of Donald Trump. My film is about the relationship of an inidual to his or her democracy, and the trauma of losing that.The film ends with Jair\u0026nbspBolsonaro’s\u0026nbspinauguration\u0026nbspas president on 1 January 2019. How is it looking back at that now?He’s fulfilling his promises. In 1999, he\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbsponce he got power he would deliver a coup, dissolve congress, and do what the military coup didn’t and kill 30,000. That is happening with Covid-19, except that 80,000 are dead. The countries hit most hard by the virus have leaders that have a lack of consideration for human life. That’s what fascism is. That’s why I’m making\u0026nbspDystopia.How are you making it?We’ve had people sending us footage from across Brazil, shot on their phones.What was the best reaction to your film?Young people saying they hadn’t spoken to their best friend for years, but after watching it, they could connect again. Plus people from Turkey, Ukraine, the UK, the US, Venezuela, who said, my God, this is our story too.A must-watch because… If you’re despairing about the state of the United States, this portrait of a new political generation is a jolt of hopeful energy.As we head into a US presidential election putting white male septuagenarians against each other, Rachel Lears’s sparky, motivating documentary is a helpful reminder that there is a younger, more erse future for American politics. Lears tracks the primary campaigns of four female progressive Democrats, but the clear star of the show is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the irresistible young New Yorker who pulled off the biggest upset victory in the 2018 midterms. Her force of personality is well-captured here: one day we’ll watch this as a reminder of where she started.Which recent documentaries most illuminate and explain the world today?

Starting with the return of Paul Pogba from Juventus to Manchester United in August 2016, Neymar, Ousmane Dembélé, Philippe Coutinho, Kylian Mbappé, Cristiano Ronaldo, Eden Hazard and João Félix have all joined the €100m club during a period that may one day come to be seen as the transfer market’s golden era or the moment football finally lost its marbles, depending on your viewpoint.Yet 12 months after a summer when clubs in Europe’s big five leagues set another record by spending almost €5.5bn on players, the global economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic means even some of the sport’s biggest names are feeling the pinch.Bayern’s signing of Leroy Sané from Manchester City for an initial €45m at the start of July means the German champions are one of the few clubs to have entered the market before it officially opens on Monday. The hiatus caused by Covid-19 means Premier League teams will have 10 weeks, until 5 October, to trade players with overseas clubs, followed by another two weeks that have been set aside for domestic transfers only.But despite clubs having extra time on their hands, Matias Lipman – an agent from Argentina who acted as the intermediary in Miguel Almirón’s move to Newcastle in 2019 and has worked on several other deals – believes there will be even more pressure on recruitment teams to deliver results in the current climate. “Some huge decisions need to be made,” he says. “A sporting director who makes a wrong call on a player could be devastating for a small or medium-sized club that really needs those funds to be able to continue competing. I would say it’s their biggest challenge ever.“So far, it’s been really difficult for the market to get moving. Some clubs still don’t know how much their budgets will be affected by the pandemic. Like in any other industry, the smaller clubs need the bigger clubs to start spending money. Until that happens, it will be hard for everything to take off.”“Those clubs are looking for deals to recover the money they spent, but that is going to be really difficult. The market is simply not the same as it was in 2017,” says Lipman. “Even if you have an option to buy a player for a certain value, some clubs are going to offer less because they know things have changed. A lot of release clauses don’t make any sense any more. It’s definitely a buyer’s market – whoever has the money will set the tone for the rest of the clubs.”In April, Christian Seifert, the Bundesliga chief executive, predicted the transfer market would collapse in an interview with the New York Times, adding that “some leagues will understand that money is not coming automatically every month from heaven”. But with most of Europe’s major domestic leagues now almost completed, there are already a few positive signs of activity.Chelsea’s pursuit of Kai Havertz from Bayer Leverkusen after committing the best part of £90m in transfer fees on Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech shows that some clubs are willing to take a risk, although it remains to be seen whether in-demand players such as Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho can command the same fees as they could in the past.“It could be an opportunity for some clubs to steal a march on their rivals but not all owners are going to be that gung ho about it,” says Omar Chaudhuri, the head of football intelligence at 21st Club, a consultancy that works with many leading sides in Europe. “Down the leagues will be more scrambling than anything else – if you’re a Championship or League One club and have a player that is worth a little bit of money then you’re going to want to try and sell him now because your financial need is probably greater at the moment.”Research from 21st Club has estimated that for every euro a top-ision European club outside the big five leagues earns from one of the three traditional income streams, they receive €0.41 in transfer income. In Croatia, which was found by a study from CIES Football Observatory to be the biggest exporter of players in the world based on population in 2017, that rises to €3 for every €1 in traditional income, meaning falling prices this summer are bound to hit clubs who rely on selling players to survive.“In England, Brentford is the most obvious example of a club who have done that very well and more and more are trying to go to that model,” says Chaudhuri. “The biggest issue is that it’s hard to predict – if you have a bad year then that can set the whole club back five years. But there is a confidence that things will slowly recover and I can see there being more €100m transfers in the next two or three years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d36a164338c75c1638b111414ec0d5ed4151c410/0_3_2369_1421/master/2369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10352fd5f626cde8bfbd778d17b6ae09","title":"arsenal v watford premier league live","story":"Arsenal won’t be playing a back four today, Mikel Arteta confirms. That’s as much as he’ll admit to at the moment, though.Eddie Howe says training has been “very intense”. “The early part of the game will be really important for us to build some momentum. We know what we have to do, so I anticipate the players will be giving everything. We looked at past seasons, just the unpredictability of the final day. We just have to do our job today and hope for that unpredictability in the other games.I’ve got to say that Hayden Mullins, Watford’s caretaker bench-warmer, doesn’t look like the most inspiring of speakers. Maybe he’s just got a very straight media face. “The main feeling is they want to get the game going,” he says of his charges. “I’m sure they want the whistle to start the game and we want to go out and try and perform. They know the whole club’s behind them, the fans and everyone. They know the job they’ve got to do today, it’s just about staying focused and trying to get the result we need.”The support and assistance offered by Watford to staff at neighbouring Watford General as well as other West Herts hospitals during lockdown was impressive, and even if events on the pitch this season haven’t exactly been encouraging the club’s continued community focus does reflect well on their ownership, and on their chairman, Scott Duxbury. Hopefully they will continue to look like safe hands in another year or two.The line-ups in today’s two other relegation-related games:“Today is more than three points,” says Abdoulaye Doucoure, “it’s the game of our lives.” Carpe the bloody diem, lads.I’m just not sure that form can be turned on like a tap, from dry to gushing, and even if it can why there should be any rational expectation that a team that has so miserably failed to do so for months can suddenly manage it today. But still, where there’s life there’s hope.So Arsenal, with Aston Villa and Watford to play within the space of five days, make six changes for the Villa game, lose it miserably, then Mikel Arteta insists that because “we have to respect that there are a few teams in the relegation battle and we are responsible for that as well” and goes back as close as possible to the full-strength side that started last weekend’s FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City for the game against Watford. He’s got his own issues to worry about, and there’s no reason why he should give two hoots about Watford or anyone else, but if he was motivated at all by genuine respect for the teams in the relegation battle he should have started this game with the same players that lined up at Villa Park, surely?In 2015 Bournemouth, Watford and Norwich were promoted together to the Premier League. Today they will go down together – unless, that is, we have ourselves some last-day fun.I’ll be keeping an eye on all of them, but concentrating on the Emirates where the situation facing Watford is clear: lose and they’re gone, unless Aston Villa themselves lose by a margin at least two goals greater get more points than Aston Villa and they stay up win by two or more goals than an also-victorious Villa and they are also saved. As for the other relegation-haunted teams, Bournemouth need to win and for both of Villa and Watford to lose Villa need to match or better Watford’s result, and for Bournemouth not to win if they lose.Norwich have been in the bottom three since the first weekend of October Bournemouth have been there since February Watford have been out since 1 March, until Villa’s win over Arsenal on Wednesday plunged them neck-deep back into trouble. There somehow seems to be something preordained about Villa’s survival. There was their home game against Watford in January, when they were a goal down with just over 20 minutes to play, Tyrone Mings, already on a booking, got away with a clear handball, and then got the winning goal with the last kick of the game (I say kick, it was mostly off his arse). There was their first game after the restart, when Sheffield United scored a perfectly good goal that wasn’t awarded because the goalline technology broke and the VAR was asleep. There was their first win after the restart, when Crystal Palace had a perfectly good opening goal disallowed because the VAR was a bit confused about human anatomy and Villa ended up snaffling victory. There’s no suggestion of conspiracy here, but ye gods have certainly been smiling upon them.Nobody’s been smiling on Watford, not for a long time now. They have not played a single game since the restart when they have not, at some stage, been losing. Five of the eight games have also ended with them losing. There have been a couple of wins, neither very impressive. At the end of the last one, against Newcastle a couple of weeks back, they were six points clear of Villa and Bournemouth with four to play and a small goal difference cushion to boot, enough – or so I thought – for safety. The following day Villa beat Palace, Bournemouth smashed a self-destructing Leicester, and a safe perch became a slippery slope.Today the trapdoor opens. It will soon be time to decide who falls through.As for Arsenal, it is 15 years since they last finished outside the league’s top six. They will end this season between eighth and 10th. Next week’s FA Cup final will, you’d have thought, be a greater priority at the moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/915cf6dc61fee79697e483bea2ffc4b3f0a94ecd/0_155_3336_2002/master/3336.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c9e0528d63ba59341b52ef66045ebdd","title":"leicester v manchester united premier league live","story":"“Afternoon, Rob,” says Digvijay Yadav. “Do you remember during the last Cricket WC (I am sure you’ll remember it for the rest of your life) when England briefly floundered and looked like they might crash out of the competition prompting you to label them as ‘Bilateral Bullies’? That’s me with this United team if they lose. Boys. Just. Get. The. Job. Done.”Remember it? I barely slept for five nights between the defeat to Australia and the win over India. It’s an interesting comparison, though I don’t really see it myself. I suppose one consolation for United, if they do lose today, is that they can still qualify through the Europa League. I have a feeling Leicester will win 2-1 (Vardy 2).Leicester make three changes from the team that lost heavily at Spurs a week ago: Marc Albrighton, Hamza Choudhury and Kelechi Iheanacho replace Ryan Bennett, Ayoze Perez and Harvey Barnes. It looks like James Justin will play as the right-sided centre-back, with Marc Albrighton at wing-back.Luke Shaw hasn’t made it, so Brandon Williams stays at left-back for United. They make one change: Aaron Wan-Bissaka replaces Timothy Fosu-Mensah at right-back.Hello. After barely 18 months in charge, Brendan Rodgers and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have taken Leicester and Manchester United to a Champions League final. Sure, if you really want to nitpick, it’s a final to decide who plays in the Champions League rather than who wins it. But it’s still progress for both clubs.There is a small chance they will both qualify, but that’s only if they draw and Wolves win at Stamford Bridge. The likelihood is that this will be a straight shootout. United have the draw but they also have the pressure, having reeled Leicester in since they were 14 points behind at the start of February. Leicester arguably have nothing to lose, because most people think they’ve already lost the Champions League place that seemed a sure thing in the winter.The opposite is true of United. Wednesday’s Pogtastic draw against West Ham put them into the top four for the first time since September. Even allowing for some weary recent performances, their form since signing Bruno Fernandes has been so impressive that it will be quite an anti-climax if they did it all just to finish fifth.United should be at full strength, with Luke Shaw expected to return from injury, but Leicester are without four regulars: Ben Chilwell, Ricardo Pereira and James Maddison are injured and Caglar Soyuncu is suspended. All the mood music suggests Leicester will miss out on the Champions League, but association football can be a contrary bugger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c79e7271739f81ac95dbceb4ce743de875febab2/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e066539534c562929b4a93722df26833","title":"happy to work from home for ever six ways to win over your boss","story":"We’re still delivering on the work front but without the pressures of the daily commute, little wonder so many of us want to hang on to our newly flexible livesBosses used to assume that flexible working meant their employees were watching daytime TV and sending the odd “reply all” email to look busy. Then, coronavirus arrived and working from home became vital to keeping many businesses afloat.So, how can you convince your employer to make flexible working the new normal? Here’s the evidence you need …Working from home worksA global pandemic is nobody’s idea of a perfect backdrop for a major change in working practices, but in spite of the obstacles, millions of office workers have transformed into home workers and our jobs are still getting done. Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey has even told his 5,000 employees they can choose to work at home forever. “We want employees to be able to work where they feel most creative and productive,” explained a spokesperson. Bhutta isn’t surprised. “OK, we didn’t choose this situation,” she says. “But flexibility is clearly available in many more jobs than had been advertised on that basis. We need employers to ask themselves, has there really been a significant drop in productivity? I think they’ll find employees have been doing their best in very challenging circumstances.”People are working smarterA huge amount of time during the office working day is wasted on interruptions and unnecessary meetings. “We all know the stress of presenteeism, of having to sit in a meeting room for an hour while someone drones on – it drains activity,” says Tracey Follows, founder of the strategy consultancy Futuremade. “Working from home allows you to take control of how and when you use your energy,” she says. This in turn can lead to increased efficiency.It makes employees happy You want to jump on a video call from the park? Download documents at the beach? Thanks to Vodafone’s unlimited data, you can. Helping employees to achieve a better work-life balance is an obvious way to support them and encourage their loyalty. “Flexible working means the employer gets an engaged, happy employee who is able to concentrate on their job while they’re working because they can also plan for the school pick-up or to visit elderly relatives,” says Bhutta. “When people have autonomy they are loyal and committed, which leads to benefits in terms of productivity.”The traditional office is outdatedOne look at the deserted skyscrapers in our cities shows that it’s time to retire any romantic attachment to Mad Men-style central offices. Especially now that screen partitions between desks, regular deep cleaning and one-way traffic systems will need to be implemented to help prevent future waves of coronavirus. Offices could well transform into occasional spaces where people meet for training days or to collaborate on projects. Even the CEO of Barclays Bank, Jes Staley, has acknowledged that “the notion of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past”. While, sadly, this might signal the end of the office biscuit tin, it could save employers hundreds of millions pounds in annual office costs.Businesses can access more talentSaying goodbye to the traditional office means an opportunity to welcome in new staff, talent and ideas from all over the world. “Flexibility opens up the workforce to many more people,” says Follows. “It gives opportunities for talented people who live far from big cities, who are from different socioeconomic backgrounds or have disabilities. It’s an opportunity to be grasped.”Employers get to be human tooDuring this crisis, thanks to all the video meetings, we’ve got to know our colleagues and bosses as actual people who have overloaded bookshelves, home schooled kids and cute puppies in their lives. Employers have become relatable, not just an intimidating presence at board meetings. “Seeing people’s kids and dogs popping up on video calls has meant that people’s responsibilities have become visible in the world of work, in a way that they weren’t before,” says Bhutta. “It’s been a real opportunity to see people beyond their role at work. And that’s something we don’t want to turn the clock back on.”From uninterrupted video meetings to deciding when and where you work best, getting the most from your mobile data has never been more important.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

And it’s a trend that’s set to continueIt doesn’t take a statistician to work out that we’ve all been online a lot in the last few months. From home schooling and streaming to ensuring your household has all the essentials (which may or may not have been purchased from Deliveroo), the number of gigabytes we’ve used and the time we’ve spent online has ticked ever upwards.But exactly how much more are we online now? What’s using up most of our data? And what will happen as lockdown ends? Turns out it does take statisticians to work all that out – which is why we’ve looked at their reports to compile this list of five facts about you, the internet and your data usage. You’re welcome.1. In lockdown, we’ve each been online for four hours and two minutes a dayYou always knew you had it in you to be a record breaker, didn’t you? You were right. According to Ofcom’s new Online Nation 2020 report, an annual survey looking at how the UK’s internet usage is changing, the four hours and two minutes we’ve averaged online during lockdown is a new high. And it’s an increase of 37 minutes a day per online adult compared with January 2020.Even without lockdown, we’ve been using the internet more than ever before. In the past year before we were locked down, we were online for 17 minutes a day more than the previous year. The biggest users? 18 to 24 year olds, who logged on for an hour more each day than adults overall.“That’s one of the more interesting stats that we found,” says Jory MacKay, RescueTime’s marketing manager. “This means that essentially each time you look at your phone you’ve got a 5050 chance of setting off a chain reaction of phone check ins.”5. Why unlimited data deals are great for familiesYou know that feeling when your work Zoom call’s audio goes so robotic and stuttery it’s like a Daft Punk remix? And on investigation, it turns out that the rest of your household is variously streaming video, online gaming and generally draining so much of your bandwidth that they might as well have attached a tap and be dispensing pints of it in the street?“As households are doing their learning, communicating, streaming – everything – online, that puts more pressure on the home internet,” says Gilani. “One answer is to have your own separate connection – whether through your phone or a dedicated mobile broadband connection – which means you can do what you need to do without interrupting what the rest of the family does. You can then get on with client calls while another family member is playing Fortnite.” In a pandemic, these are good problems to have.Staying connected has never been more vital – and it often seems that everyone in the family wants to be online at the same time.

Thousands of university students have been forced to return to their childhood bedrooms after their first taste of freedom was well and truly curtailed. Younger teens have had school unceremoniously cancelled, and others have not been able to leave the house at all due to health concerns. But the good news is, with lockdown easing, things are finally changing.Here three young people, with very different experiences of lockdown, describe what life feels like now they are recovering some of their much-yearned-for freedom …‘Our phones are what connect us’Anya, 19, BristolI always thought the phrase ‘absence makes the heart grow fonder’ was a bit of a cliche but my boyfriend and I are absolute proof that it’s true. Luke and I have been a couple longer in lockdown than out of it. We met in January and went from sleeping at each other’s houses five nights a week to not physically touching each other since 16 March.I have cystic fibrosis so I have had to shield at home with my mum we even disinfect food packets when they come into the house. But despite our physical distance, Luke, who’s 23, and I are closer than ever. These extraordinary times have meant we can really focus on getting to know each other at a deeper level. He makes me feel good and takes me away from the mundanity of every day. We’ve had the time and space to really talk about what’s important to us and best of all we make each other laugh.In early lockdown we’d FaceTime from the moment we woke up to when we went to sleep. I’d walk around the house with him in my hand Mum got totally used to him being here with us and has got to know him too. We’d even have date nights watching the same film on Netflix from our bedrooms.More recently we’ve made our first tentative steps into the outside world together, albeit still being physically apart. We have to take things slowly as I’m still shielding but I have driven over and had a barbecue with his family in his garden, even if I do take my own chair and plate and cutlery to be safe.We are taking it a day at a time but for now, I’m so relieved he is always by my side thanks to our phones.‘My friendships mean more to me than ever’ Carrie, 14, MacclesfieldFriendship has become even more important since March. I speak to my best friend Yaz most days and if I didn’t have her I don’t know what I’d do. We just get each other.I get on really well with my family but you talk to friends in a different way. I’ve used my phone more since lockdown than ever before. But when you’ve suddenly had all your freedom taken away it’s hardly surprising. I spend hours chatting on social media or FaceTime. Some days I look back and see I’ve been on my phone for eight hours.Before lockdown hit I loved my own space. I’m a keen mountain biker so I’d be out in the woods with friends or hanging out at mates’ houses, or a coffee shop.Now lockdown has eased, I’m out and about more so I use a lot of data. I go mountain biking and while there are more people on the trails we always do our best to socially distance. I like to meet friends in the park or go to a place nearby to wild swim. I always have my phone to reassure my mum I’m safe.But I miss socialising without having to think so carefully about it. I never thought I’d say it, but I can’t wait to go back to school.An unexpected bonus of this year is I’m getting on really well with my brother Dan, who’s 18. We used to bicker but now we really talk to each other. The other day he even invited me to join his friends around the firepit in the garden.‘I’m finally getting some freedom back’George, 21, Bishop SuttonThe second year of university is known as the party year, you’re in the swing of student life, there are no exams and just plenty of socialising and nights out. So I never imagined I’d be driving back to my family home at 1am on a March morning, as lockdown hit, and then spending the majority of the year back in my childhood bedroom. It has been hard to take, as up until March, I hadn’t spent more than three weeks consecutively at home since finishing my A-levels. On the plus side, I have enjoyed being close with my family again.I’m studying modern languages at the University of Oxford and suddenly my academic world has been taken completely online with seminars and tutorials. It has definitely been a challenge getting used to a new normal but I’m trying to remain positive.One benefit has been changing the way I work. When I was at uni it was like we were always working, doing snippets here and there. But now I’ve learned to work more intensely and so I get the work done faster. It means I have more free time.While I’m not seeing much of my uni friends I’m finally able to get out and catch up with local friends. We’ve met up for fish and chips near a local lake and have enjoyed river swims and socially distanced drinks at the harbourside. When the weather is good, life almost feels normal again as we sit in parks and chill together.But we can’t be spontaneous any more, we actually have to plan to meet up. In the old days we would just float around town and see who was around. I’m certainly more reliant on my phone and it’s useful having unlimited data. I’m used to crashing at a friend’s house if I’m visiting but now I have to think about getting home instead.It’s my year abroad next year and I’m lucky as I have got a job and am heading to Berlin. For those who are staying here, university is going to feel very different.When you can’t see the people you care about as much as you’d like, staying connected is more important than ever.

But as soon as you lift your face and taste the fresh tang of salt on the air, you will mark how this sky is as different, fickle and changeable as all you have left behind. Then, if you listen, you will hear the laughing gulls. And beyond that, heading off in a low V-shape, the haunting call of the geese.I have lived in the Hebrides for more than 16 years – the first years with my husband, and for the past decade with my dog, Maude, alone. I had been dreaming of staring out at a raw, open horizon for years – ever since I found an old map of Scotland and pinned it up in the hallway in my London flat. It was positioned across the full length of a narrow wall where I always saw it as I was passing, at an angle where your eyes fell into that empty space between giant masses of land. It is always during that notion of transit, of passing from one space to another, that your heart opens and all of your dreaming begins. I would press my nose to that thick paper, inhaling its musty scent, as my finger traced the ragged coastline of the fractured islets and islands. In those moments, as my eyes closed, the traffic, shouts from the street, neighbours slamming doors, would evaporate into the hurl of fresh spindrift, the thick, curling crests of the breakers drenching the salt-stung air, the gulls tearing the skies apart with an aching, screaming call.I had loved my early years in London. I lived in Notting Hill, in a flat with an iron gate leading out on to communal garden. It was a sanctuary in the heart of the city, with a buzzing, cosmopolitan local community on tap. I was there years before the film came out, when you bought your vegetables in a brown paper bag with cash, knew all the street vendors, got your cigarettes from the cashier at the toy shop on the corner of Kensington Park Road. It was a time of hope and dreaming of your beautiful life, and Britpop singing the world real again.But in London, neighbourhoods are transient and can shift as quickly as the low skies gusting overhead. Suddenly, there was a disconcerting invisibility to the formerly gregarious community and a disheartening, unsettling and desolate feeling that permeated the streets. People started walking more quickly, heads bowed, barely meeting your eyes. Humanity is a vulnerable, vigilant thing. Our building was spray-painted with graffiti, windows were broken, the police were called. One day, arriving home, I screamed as I walked into the back garden. The plants were torn apart, some that were flowering had been uprooted. I fought tears as I looked into the pond. Cans of paint had been poured over the wall, the containers left floating in the water. Hidden in the reeds were the faded, bloated corpses of our beautiful, bright little fish. Something died in me that day.A neighbour was mugged, then another knocked to the ground. I stopped walking around the neighbourhood. Those weeks were a tense, nail-biting time when everything became dark and feral. Worn down by months of this, I started waking in the night, feeling breathless, my heart thudding. Stress is invisible subtle and insidious, it builds up over time. Anxiety is like a smouldering fire. All it takes is a scream, a moment of fear, to whip those flickering embers into burning flames.It was the fall of silence that struck me. It had a porous feel to it, as if the sky had been spilled into it until there was room for little else. No raised voices, no bricks through the window. No rattling of sticks on a metal grille, or buses thundering past. Inside, there was a stillness like cool, clear water. And I knew that it was this quiet that I had been seeking for so long. It did not matter that the cottage we had moved our lives into had no water, electricity, outside drains or paint on its walls. It did not matter that there was no heating or insulation. Nor that it was as freezing cold inside as it was outside, with just a single stone grate in one end wall. It did not matter that it was unloved and had not been lived in for five years.I will never forget the day I travelled to start my life on the island. Arriving alone, as a stranger, was one of those unnerving twists of fate that only holds a deeper resonance in later years. I like to think it was my first test of facing my fears and putting my trust in the unknown. Looking back, I had no idea that those early years would only be the start of a fiercer, wilder, intensely difficult period that would tax my courage, resilience and endurance to breaking point and beyond. Growth is not always easy, and sometimes a new seed has to be encouraged, even forced, to grow.The island is barely 12 miles long, its narrow girth tightening to half a mile, with close to 140 residents, another 10 or so renting temporarily. I had not planned to be here alone. We arrived as a couple and at first we were happy. When my husband left, the challenges began. I was grief-stricken and struggling to cope. My father had only recently died and my mother had been diagnosed with a terminal illness. I was still shattered by devastating loss after years of infertility, up to my neck in crippling debt and unable to work, struggling to function. My confidence was drained I had broken both of my hands in two separate accidents, and simple tasks became overwhelmingly difficult. I felt helpless. Then my best friend – a woman I had met on the island – was killed in a car crash.Grief is like soil. It is heavy and clings to your skin when you come up for air. Sometimes even after you have brushed it off it is suddenly there again, miring you in something dead and weighted and dark.For a few years, solitude became all my life. When I lived in London, solitude was synonymous with relaxation. It meant a pause or vital decompression, a moment of balancing, a slow drawing of breath – an experience to be savoured. It was never so internal as to be a state or frame of mind. I looked forward to it – time set aside to allow something restricted inside to free itself. On the island, my experience of isolation was frightening because it so quickly normalised – a clear, cold wind of solitude that I used to love now wrapped around me, a constant presence. I began to notice I was often shivering, how the days felt cold. Isolation is a process of self-harming. You do not wish to go there, but over time it feels a safe place to be. It is addictive.I have always been sociable and, in London, was used to being surrounded by company. I knew something was wrong when I felt unable to connect with others on the island. I kept trying to reach out, but it was as if some inner inhibition was blocking me, so each encounter hurt, like a bruising collision. Authentic connection is made more difficult when you are living alone, at a distance from close friends and family. I found myself searching others’ eyes like a moth seeking a light – but my eyes were always too wanting or hopeful. Over time, those collisions felt increasingly sharp, abrasive.When I was most isolated, I was also coping with an acute yet chronic respiratory illness and my immune system collapsed. Each intake of breath felt like inhaling tiny shards of glass. One winter night, I forced myself out of the house. I stood alone, wrapped in blankets, shivering in the darkness. It was such a comfort to look up and feel that great breathing night sky around me, eyes wide, gazing into a dark glittering universe of stars. It helped me to take a breath, force myself to stretch out, to release that suffocating inhibition. That night, I lifted my arms and asked for help. I was aware of feeling some mysterious reciprocity of kindness. Something inexpressible in the immense darkness answered me.Now I embrace solitude. For the past four years, at dawn, I have run across the hills to the sea. It was the sea that helped me break that cold silence inside. Each day I throw lost hours into the water. It renews my strength, fires resilience inside and gives me a sense of gratitude for my warm breath and beating heart. I never used to like cold water, yet here I have grown to love its shocking, icy embrace. Every day, whatever the weather, I rise early and head for the shore. I have not missed a day, regardless of storms and punishing Hebridean conditions. I have swum in snow, in freezing rain with thick ice particles obscuring visibility, in crisp sunshine and in dense mist, and once with the wind chill dipping to -16C and the solid, crackling edges of the sea freezing.Standing on the shoreline as the waves come barrelling towards you helps you to step into all you normally draw back from. Cold water swimming takes you beyond resistance. It invites you to ask, “What else do you fear?” It forces you to tackle all in your life that has a stronger undertow. In the water there is no place for fear. I used to tell myself, “Soon I will stop.” Eventually, I realised I didn’t want to. It gets me up to set firm boundaries. It teaches stamina, courage, inner resilience and buoyancy. Sometimes you think you have nothing left to give, and then it asks for more, so you give more of yourself than you ever imagined was possible. If I can stand bare-skinned in the freezing cold, hurl myself into the waves and keep swimming, then I am winning.Solitude helps you to redraw your own parameters, but its navigation takes skill and practice. Immersed in nature, you learn to look to the tides, winds, weather, currents, and raw elements more closely. That knowledge becomes instinctive. When I am alone, I am more focused and attuned to the particular nuances and subtleties in the natural world around me. Life is simplified. You feel your own humanity, physicality and interconnectedness acutely.These days, life runs calmly. I have dear friends and close community, yet I still value and actively make space for my own solitude. I still do not have family, kin, children, so I have learned to fill that space with different, other lives. Now I understand how isolation and often the most shattering experiences in life are so important. The profound depth of our suffering holds all kinds of hidden truths. Nature is regenerative. Everything has to break down in order to renew.Each morning, as I wake to the dawn sky and the sun rising over the mountains, the sound of the wind and weather is a familiar, loved presence. I always sleep with my window open. If I listen, I hear the buzzards and a great silence of mountains beyond. It is quiet when I go downstairs. There is always a quality of stillness that is only felt in an old house. In winter the power still goes off and so the early mornings start with candlelight. I rarely eat alone. Wild birds often fly in the open windows. They sit perched on a gnarled hazel twig that swings tied to a branch I use as a curtain rail. We sit and watch each other as I talk to Maude, pressed close against my legs.When you immerse yourself deeply into nature, exposing yourself to discomfort and risk, you recalibrate more sensitively to unseen patterns and rhythms. You feel your own pulse and breath instilled with a peace and calmness. The rugged landscape becomes hewn differently, takes on more intimate contours. Immersed daily in the sea, swimming in all weathers, it is interesting how other aspects of your life start adjusting to this routine. Tasks are organised differently, more closely aligned to the bigger cycles of sun, moon and tides and seasonal shifts. Some call this biodynamic living, and it makes sense. It connects the unique solitude of every animate or inanimate sentience, and connects it to an expansive, interconnected universe.That realisation came to me one early dawn. It was freezing, the depths of winter. I stripped off and ed into the waves. Out in the channel, the wind had dropped and snow, long promised, started to fall. Then something happened that changed my life. A wilder voice called my name with love and changed me forever. Afterwards, all it takes is a breath to reconnect to the pulse and beat of the universe. Once that feeling is experienced, it is impossible ever to feel alone.

Here we answer the important questions employers and employees faceWorking from home looks set to be a part of many people’s lives for some time to come. At the beginning of lockdown in March, employees would have been forgiven for thinking that their office moving to their spare room or kitchen table would be a temporary affair. The reality is that many will remain there until next year.RBS announced that almost 50,000 workers will not go back into the office until 2021, even as the government urged employers to encourage their staff to return. While many people may have been able to deal with a few months at home, the prospect of many more to come throws up a series of questions for them and their bosses.HMRC says that some of the cost of working from home may be eligible for tax relief, such as business phone calls or the gas and electricity for your work area. However, expenses that are used for both private and business use cannot be claimed for. Fill out a P87 form if they are less than £2,500 for the year. You will need records and receipts when filling it out.If more, you will need to complete a self-assessment tax return. However, it can be difficult to apportion costs so you can, instead, claim tax relief on £6 a week. Or your employer is allowed to pay you £6 a week tax-free.At the start of lockdown computer retailers reported a glut of orders as companies stocked up on laptops needed by staff to work from home. However, not all employers will agree to cover the cost, and many workers can find they have to foot the bill themselves for setting up a home office, or they have to use their own equipment. Conciliation service Acas says both sides should agree beforehand on how they should work and what equipment will be used.Employers should carry out risk assessments - if not, they could be found at fault in a future claim for something like repetitive strain injury. The chance of problems arising grow with the amount of time workers are at home, says Caroline Doran Millett, an employment lawyer at Royds Withy King. She expects there to be a series of claims in the coming years as a result of using incorrect work equipment.“If someone gets injured because the employer has not done a risk assessment, it falls back to the employer and we are looking at potential personal injury,” she says. “Now it is not a short-term thing, there needs to be a lot more thought put into it and this does involve expenses, which is why a lot of employers are trying to punt it down the road.”In or out of the office, employers have the same obligations. John Palmer of Acas says there should be good communication between the two sides, especially if there is increased stress.“If an employee is pregnant… the rules broadly apply like they would in any workplace, for example carrying out a risk assessment,” he says. “One possible upside to this is that for some pregnant women, working from home could bring benefits, such as not having to commute and having instant access to everything in their house.”With children at home the working day is much less coherent for many parents and can lead to unintended interruptions, as witnessed on TV news shows recently. Covering childcare has been a significant stress, and the prospect of children returning to schools will be a relief for many. Legally, you can take time off to look after any dependants, but it is typically unpaid, and really intended to cover short-term emergencies.“If an employee can’t make childcare arrangements that work in harmony with their job, they are likely to be able to take what is called ‘time off for dependants’, which is generally unpaid leave,” says Palmer. “It might also be their situation could qualify for furlough leave, too. What employers need to be careful of, is that they do not end up discriminating against some groups when they could have been a little more flexible.”The insurance industry has said employees now working from home will continue to be insured under their home policies but this may change. “If you are an office-based worker and are working from home as a result of the pandemic, your home insurance cover will not be affected. You do not need to contact your insurer to update your documents or extend your cover,” says the Association of British Insurers (ABI).This is to be reviewed on 1 September. It explains: “If you are able to return to work, but are choosing to work from home more often, then you may need to inform your insurer. Check your policy documents or insurer’s website, and if you are still unsure, check with your insurer.”While many workers will be spending the rest of the year in their back room, others will be going back to the office. But many will not want to return to the “dead time” of commuting, or face the risk of contracting coronavirus while there. The Law Society, the professional body for solicitors, has said that before coronavirus, employees would have had to return but now they are entitled to ask questions about what safeguards are in place. Under the government’s plans to get employees back to work, businesses have a duty to have a risk assessment.“If you’re unsure whether the workplace is safe, ask your employer to explain the measures they’re implementing to bring the risks down to an acceptable level,” the Law Society recommends."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a0976d0f6eaccdb65b74bc984353d69cc890443/0_209_6720_4034/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d57e1b40ee6c6ef9c4fbba93fd0c2160","title":"the shocking truth of racism in british schools","story":"When a teenage activist sent a callout on social media for examples of racism within schools, he was deluged with responses.

Fred Titmus, England and Middlesex legend, is racially abusing Lonsdale Skinner of Surrey. “He was calling me black bastard and that kind of stuff,” Skinner recalls. He was a capped Surrey player at the time, a Guyana-born wicketkeeper-batsman who moved to England as a child and was part of the vanguard for a generation of black county cricketers.Titmus was in the middle of a brief spell as Surrey’s head coach. He would later become an England selector and is one of several illustrious names to come up more than once when black players discuss the everyday racism of the times. On this occasion one player stood up to support Skinner from the ranks, an unknown youngster from Uppingham School. Enter the 16-year-old Jonathan Agnew, now the BBC’s cricket correspondent.“Agnew jumped up and said: ‘You shouldn’t be doing this, it’s not on.’ He was playing for Surrey twos, down on trial. Titmus was carrying on in front of everybody and Agnew said: ‘No, no, this is not acceptable.’ He was the only one who stood up.”While Skinner remembers Agnew’s support with real warmth (“He was genuinely quick in those days, I used to tell him: Don’t pitch it up to these public schoolboys, put it across their ears”) he was already well-hardened to this kind of environment.Another early memory is going for his medical as a 17-year-old, with another new joiner, Bob Willis, also in the room. The club doctor asked Skinner: “Have you ever had syphilis?” Skinner had no idea what syphilis was. The teenage Willis wasn’t asked the same question. While the incident remained a private joke between the two men, for Skinner it was also a note of warning.“On my second day they tried to give me a name, black something or other. I told them no, that’s not working. I said, I live down the Northern Line and we don’t play there. You know my name, so call me by my name. Don’t give me none of these caricatures or we are going to have trouble.”During seven seasons he played 178 games for Surrey as wicketkeeper-batsman and occasional opener (“the early sacrifice on wet wickets when the bowling was fast, I didn’t mind.”) “There were plenty of good guys, too,” he adds.Mike Selvey, once of these pages, is mentioned as an ally for black players at the time, as is Mike Brearley, whose appearance at Middlesex coincided with a notoriously hostile dressing room, a legacy of the Titmus years, “becoming civilised”.“Most of the racism came from outside the dressing room. It was from the committee room, the decision-makers. They had something to protect. If you had one bad year, you’re gone. They didn’t want you there.”Skinner saw the effects of this on his friend Wes Stewart, a pioneer in English cricket as a black fast bowler with Middlesex. Stewart had come to England as a Windrush child in 1955, and would later face a brutal seven-year battle to avoid an unjust deportation, fruits of the government’s hostile environment policies.“I’ve seen a broken man in Wes Stewart. Two years, he took 130 wickets at 23, and did not get a third year. He was never the same. I don’t think he lived after he was 26, when Middlesex got rid of him. I think that killed him.“He didn’t have a plan, he was thinking about the next year. He didn’t recover. In those days there was no comeback.”It is this sense of exclusion from the structures of power that Skinner is addressing now in his role as chairman of the African Caribbean Cricket Association. Formed in 2013, the ACCA works to engage young black people in recreational and professional cricket and was involved in Surrey’s recent ACE programme, of which Skinner speaks with some optimism.But then, the bar is pretty low right now. The last black English-born player to make a Test debut for the country was Michael Carberry a decade ago. There are no high‑profile black administrators. The line is often repeated that young black English people just don’t like cricket – a source of genuine exasperation at the ACCA and an easy fall-back for those overseeing this dying back.It is this attitude the ACCA still sees in the ECB’s recent attempts to present a more inclusive front. Even the remarks from its chief executive, Tom Harrison, laced with good sense and good intentions, contained a strange interlude where he asked whether the connection between black English people and English cricket has ever existed, comments that drew bemusement and dismay from some of those who have worked to build that connection.As Skinner points out, the first black cricketers in England pre-dated the Windrush generation. The point is not a lack of interest or a lack of a deeper connection, but structures that exclude or fail to feed that interest.Skinner’s own story is an example of how tough the first steps can be. As a Surrey schoolboy he was racially abused by a senior pro for the crime of wearing his “jazz hat”, a brown cap with the club’s yellow stripes. “He was shouting: ‘You fucking black so and so, what are you doing with that?’ I just laughed, I could cope with him. But they had to know that you weren’t an easy boy. And at that age I felt invincible.”Skinner became a Surrey colt in 1967, a year after the rule was abolished that junior cricketers had to go to a fee-paying school. He has uncompromising views on the way the counties organise junior cricket now.“The county academies are a system dreamed up by the middle class for middle-class children. First thing, they start at 10 years old. And if you’re poor you don’t start cricket at 10. You can’t compete at that age.“Then as you go along mum and dad don’t have the time to take you every Sunday and Saturday and wait to bring you back. When you get to age 14 they start at four-thirty in the afternoon, and mum and dad have to be at work, so then you don’t get into the academy proper. It is what we would call an undocumented exclusion.”Skinner’s county career ended with the appearance of Titmus and Alf Gover at the Oval. Mindful of his future he retired aged 26 (Mickey Stewart pleaded with him to stay) and did a social sciences degree followed by an MBA.The ACCA is a means of applying this expertise. Although, when it comes to top-down programmes there is some despairing laughter from Skinner and the vice-chairman, Derek Gift-Simms, at their journey through the levels of cricket’s ersity industry. This ranges from the charity executive who told Skinner Caribbean people “didn’t exist” as a group within cricket (“I said: I’m sorry, are you talking to me?”) to the cricket official who thought BAME stood for British, African and Middle Eastern (“that made me feel great confidence in her”). To the occasional requests to “bring some Caribbean children along” when West Indies play in England (“where are we going to get Caribbean children from? We’re English.”)What Skinner would really like is an independent investigation into how cricket can widen the talent pool and re-engage with this whole sector of society. In the meantime the ACCA has written to the ECB asking a series of pertinent questions about how many black people are employed in its organisation, how many county committee members are black, how many black people are involved where its funds are dispersed.Recently, they made the discovery there are 20 black level-three qualified coaches in the entire country. The ECB has already made some changes in response to this, notably dropping the panel interview for prospective elite coaches.Another issue that comes up elsewhere too, and seems to capture something wider, is the sanitising of crowds. The decision in the mid-1990s to ban horns, drums and musical sections (although not for the Barmy Army) changed the atmosphere fundamentally, something many black spectators feel was not an unintended consequence.Skinner says: “Many people didn’t want to go any more. Now they want them to go back again. But it’s not a light you can just switch on and off. There is a desire to go. But people were hurt. They need to be made to feel welcome.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30b145c2836c5625059d60873be8859337597ef6/0_100_4416_2650/master/4416.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=66a55436e548e782748b2289511634aa","title":"can virtual reality really get you fit","story":"Our writer dons a headset and turns boxer, air guitarist and saber wielder in a bid to shake off his lockdown lassitudeLike many people, by May I was having a difficult time in lockdown: struggling with homeschooling stressing about work tired out by Zoom calls comfort eating drinking too much and feeling nervous about venturing out for short walks, let alone exercise.And then I strapped a computer to my face and gave thin air a damn good pummelling and everything improved a little. Virtual reality’s role in helping me to clamber out of the lockdown blues has changed the way I think about the technology and its potential to play a meaningful role in day-to-day life.I’ve written a fair bit about virtual reality (VR) as a medium in the past, testing headsets and apps and interviewing their creators with curiosity and an open mind. Yet my professional interest never ignited the desire to spend my own time using technology that – by necessity in its current iteration – isolates you from the people around you. (Cue the obligatory joke: that’s what smartphones are for, right?)The shift started in May, with an impulse purchase of an Oculus Quest headset and a fitness app called BoxVR. It’s essentially Guitar Hero meets boxercise: you jab, hook and uppercut glowing orbs and duck or dodge barriers, all of which fly at you in sync with a soundtrack ranging from rock, pop and dance to drum’n’bass.I’m not a boxer. Less “float like a butterfly, sting like a bee” and more “pant like a water buffalo, flap like a tired kitten” in truth. But over six weeks, BoxVR became a daily habit and, as good exercise should, provided the spark to go walking, eat healthily and leave the giant crate of cider untouched most nights (also a lockdown impulse purchase).Other people clearly see something in BoxVR too: in July, the London tech startup behind it, FitXR, announced a funding round of £6m from a group of venture capital investors plus the government’s Innovate UK agency.The company’s co-founders, Sam Cole and Sameer Baroova, met at business school before founding FitXR in 2016, drawing on Cole’s background in finance and Baroova’s career as a games developer.“We don’t see ourselves as a gaming studio, but as a fitness company,” says Cole, adding that FitXR was set up in the belief that “the next computing platform after the smartphone was going to be some kind of mixed reality headset” and that “fitness everywhere would be completely transformed”.Video companies love this kind of talk, but in recent years, the outlook for VR technology has looked distinctly mixed. In 2016, a research firm, IHS Markit, predicted that by 2020 there would be 81m VR headsets in use globally.And now? In May this year, research firm Omdia, which acquired IHS Markit’s tech ision in 2019, estimated that the current base is about 26m units. Sales have been disappointing, certainly compared with the bullish expectations when the Oculus Rift headset kicked off the modern VR hardware generation. Facebook bought its maker for $2bn in 2014 two years after a kickstarter funding campaign and the headset went on commercial sale in 2016.Sluggish sales tipped VR sharply into what the famous “Hype Cycle” theory from Gartner, a firm of analysts, describes as the “trough of disillusionment”, although 2019 and 2020 have seen it progress to the next stage of that cycle: the “slope of enlightenment” – with fitness one of the app genres doing the lifting.Facebook’s Oculus Quest, released in May 2019, was hailed as a big step forward. It was a standalone headset – you didn’t have to connect it to a computer or console – and it was priced at a relatively affordable £400 to £500. In its first year, Quest owners bought £80m worth of games and apps from its official store.“The Oculus Quest really reflected an inflection point in the industry, where suddenly the technology was far more accessible and intuitive than it had ever been before,” says Cole. “I could send a headset back to my mum in New Zealand and she could take it out of the box and operate it.”The Quest, together with Sony’s PlayStation VR and digital game store Steam (which supplies games for other VR headsets) have created an increasingly healthy market for developers and startups to target. Games remain the dominant category, but fitness has emerged as another key genre.Punchy alternatives to BoxVR include Creed: Rise to Glory and The Thrill of the Fight, which offer animated opponents to fight. In the US, veteran VR producer Within Unlimited has launched a workout app called Supernatural, using a gym-style subscription ($19 a month or $179 a year).There’s also a burgeoning category of games with fitness as a secondary feature, many of which go down the “Guitar Hero but with punching and hand-wiggling” music-rhythm route.Synth Riders, Audioshield, Audio Trip and Beat Saber (see below) are just four examples of VR games that will see you work up a sweat. The latter sold a million copies in its first nine months, its developer was acquired by Facebook in November 2019, and it has since passed the 2m sales milestone, while licensing music from big artists such as Green Day, Imagine Dragons and Timbaland.There is also an emerging community around VR fitness, from YouTubers posting their BoxVR and Beat Saber workouts, to a website called the Virtual Reality Institute of Health and Exercise.It rates VR apps and games based on their calorie burn per minute, comparing them to real exercises such as tennis, rowing and cycling.According to its ratings, BoxVR burns a tennis-like six to eight calories a minute for the average user, although its top rating goes to a version of Audioshield that is equivalent to a bike ride, burning 10 to 13 calories a minute.Calorie burn seems to be the prime metric for VR fitness in 2020, which I’m a little wary of, having jumped on the step-counting, food-logging, exercise-tracking app bandwagon in past attempts to get fit, which all saw me slip off it within a few months.For me, the appeal of VR fitness is that it’s fun, yes, but also that I can lose myself in a workout in a way I struggle to in other contexts. The physical isolation of wearing a headset, it turns out, suits me well.“That’s really the power of it,” says Cole. “You can enter that flow-like state. Some people get that when they’re running: they can really get lost in a run with a great Spotify playlist on and forget that they’ve been out there for half an hour pounding the pavement. For other people, that’s an impossible task.”His words are mirrored by those of another VR fitness co-founder, Bojana Knezevic of Holodia, which makes technology for VR workouts on rowing machines, exercise bikes and elliptical machines at home or in the gym.“The combination of the full immersion, helping people forget they are working out, and the gamification and competition, motivating them to push harder, is why VR fitness appeals more and more to the general population,” she says.Knezevic identifies the evolution of VR hardware as a key reason for the growth of fitness apps and games, but thinks further developments will come from creativity – looking beyond traditional real-world workouts.“VR fitness innovation is driven, on one side, by VR hardware developments. You have headsets that are super comfortable, don’t make you sweat and have no fogging issues, as was the case in the past. And they are affordable,” she says.“On the other hand, the freedom that VR content development gives means you don’t have to limit yourself to traditional sports: you can make your body move and work out in any way you want. This is where creativity, fantasy combined with sports science, comes in and drives further innovation.”The next wave of VR fitness invention may well be social, too. Holodia and Supernatural have companion apps that compare your scores with friends, while BoxVR has global rankings for each of its workouts and a multiplayer mode. My proudest lockdown moment so far has been breaking into the top 50 of its “Unspoken” metal-soundtracked class.Cole says FitXR has big plans on this front. “You will use the product and feel closer to exercising in a group setting,” he says. “BoxVR and other applications are really just scratching the surface. I think social and multiplayer applications are going to be a really important part of how VR scales up.”As for actual gyms, they may play a role too, as they open again after lockdown. Knezevic says that in Asia and the Middle East there is already “a new boutique concept of VR gyms” with headsets in their studios plus programmes of virtual workouts, classes and coaching for members at home.“They are adjusting their business models, monetising VR fitness and making sure they are relevant in the future,” she says. Cole, meanwhile, notes that gyms will always have more equipment on site than the average exerciser could afford to have at home.However, he envisages a future where people might take a mixed-reality headset – one that lets them see their surrounding environment – to the gym and use it to show them how to use particular weights or machines.As I write this, the gym that I belong to is about to reopen and, despite my new VR boxing habit, I can’t wait to get back there, a mark of how well it has created a real-world community among its members.VR isn’t a gym-killer just yet, but it can be an alternative for some people and a complement for others. For this buffalo-panting (but rapidly less kitten-flappy) amateur pugilist, this increase in choice feels like a healthy thing.Boxercise in the virtual world to a soundtrack from emerging artists, taking in rock, pop and dance, but also metal and drum’n’bass.The music game Facebook “liked so much it bought the company”. You swish a pair of virtual sticks to break boxes in time to music.Already a popular console game, Dance Central works just as well as a VR title, with 32 tracks to learn the steps to and work up a sweat.There are more than 200 tai chi workouts to try in this game, which is a good way to prepare for doing tai chi in the real world without falling on your face.If BoxVR’s glowing orbs aren’t your thing, try this game’s fleshier boxers. The fights may be virtual, but the sweat you work up is very real.This music game is all about the arm waving, as you try to follow lines (or “rails”) of coloured spheres. Joyful, even if you look ridiculous to onlookers.Another “hit glowing objects flying at your face” VR music game, but with a killer soundtrack: Lady Gaga, Deadmau5 and Skrillex are all included.US-only for now, but one of the most serious attempts yet to marry music and fitness, with new workouts daily and a mass of stats charting your progress.The TV show Hole in the Wall saw Lycra-clad contestants contorting to fit through people-shaped holes in an onrushing wall. This is that, but in VR. Lycra optional.Still in “early access” on digital games store Steam to get feedback from players, PowerBeatsVR has lots of promise with its punching, dodging and squatting.

What next?The Sheraton Waikiki stands just a sea-smooth pebble throw from one of Hawaii’s most famous beaches. Working the front desk, Jordyn Wallace loved meeting new people from different states and faraway countries in one of the world’s most beautiful holiday destinations.Like many Hawaiians, Wallace has been working in tourism since she graduated high school five years ago, and started her front-desk job in December. Then the pandemic came and Wallace lost her job, as Hawaii was forced to make a literally life-changing decision: close down to stop Covid-19 and weather an economic maelstrom unseen in decades.On 21 March Hawaii’s governor David Ige announced all visitors to the islands must quarantine for 14 days. The flip-flopped travelers disappeared. Stores and restaurants began to close under state shutdown orders. Wallace had her hours dramatically cut, only working a few shifts in April and May before being laid off.“I have never seen Waikiki so empty. It felt surreal because no matter what time of day it is, you always see visitors in Waikiki,” Wallace said. “We have more than 1,000 rooms. It’s a huge hotel, and to not see a single soul on property was crazy.”Nearly every state in the US implemented some type of shutdown order to prevent the spread of Covid-19, closing bars, restaurants and gyms and starting a new way of socially distanced life. The shutdowns brought on Depression-level unemployment numbers, the effects of which have lingered even as states reopen their economies.For Hawaii, being an isolated chain of islands in the middle of the Pacific has proved to be a blessing and a curse. That Hawaii is only accessible by plane or cruise ship has provided the state with a geographic advantage in preventing the spread of the virus. But encouraging people to stay away has severely damaged the state’s economy, which relies heavily on the tourist dollar.“Every day, there is something on the news that announces businesses are shutting down. These are not new business. They are family businesses, they are institutions, and these are businesses that have survived economic challenges in the past,” said Sherry Menor-McNamara, president and chief executive of the Hawaii Chamber of Commerce.While other states in the US, such as Florida and Texas, saw huge spikes in Covid-19 cases as state governments worked to reopen economies, Hawaii instead rolled out a policy that deliberately stopped tourism to ensure the health of its residents.People who break quarantine are subject to arrest and a fine of up to $5,000. Hawaii has been strict in enforcing the rules, arresting nearly 200 people, visitors and residents, since March.Quarantine has helped stop any large outbreaks of the virus. As of 22 July, Hawaii has reported just over 1,400 cases and 25 deaths. In comparison, New Hampshire, which has a slightly smaller population than Hawaii, has had over 6,000 confirmed cases and nearly 400 deaths.Hawaii’s online system for filing unemployment claims was so overwhelmed that many had to wait at least a month to receive any payment.Wallace applied for unemployment in March, once her hours were cut to almost nothing. Right before the pandemic hit, she had just taken out a loan to consolidate some credit card and medical debts. Without payments, Wallace would not be able to make her payments on time, triggering high interest rates.Her payments finally came in May, after weeks of trying to get answers from the unemployment office. “It was just an absolute nightmare trying to get a hold of their office,” she said.But the effects on the leisure and hospitality industry will linger. Last year, 10.5 million visitors spent $17bn when traveling to the islands, with $2bn of that money going directly to the state government.About $7bn has been pumped into Hawaii’s economy over the past four months from the federal government’s emergency stimulus programs. But that is not enough to make up for the huge shortfall.State budgets across the country have been devastated by the pandemic. Hawaii will likely prove to be no exception. Earlier this month, Governor Ige said pay cuts for state and local workers, including teachers, are inevitable. The state government will be left short of $1.2bn, according to a report from the University of Hawaii’s Economic Research Organization (UHERO). This deficit is “far worse than those encountered during the Great Recession”, the report said.Carl Bonham, a professor of economics at the University of Hawaii and executive director of UHERO, said the disproportionate effect the pandemic has had on tourism compared to other industries means the state will be slow to recover from the economic effects.“Much of the rest of the country will recover faster than Hawaii. Even once there is better treatment or better control of the virus, there will still be lingering effects on air travel,” Bonham said. “Hawaii will be a different place over the next year or so as we have an increase of bankruptcies and failures of businesses. There will be fewer activities for visitors to come to.”Bonham said more federal aid is the only way Hawaii’s economy can recover. Even with more aid, it will likely be short of money for the next five years, he said.With Congress at a standstill over giving additional aid to states and local governments, Hawaii’s leaders have been scrambling for solutions that would allow tourists to carefully come back.Currently, all bets are hedged on a plan that would allow visitors to bypass the 14-day quarantine if they test negative for the virus 72 hours before their flight to Hawaii, and show proof of the negative test. The state is in talks with CVS Pharmacy over a potential partnership to make tests available to incoming travelers.The plan was originally slated to start 1 August, but the governor pushed the date back to 1 September, citing the surge of infections in other states. While the delay is upsetting to many business owners, eight out of 10 residents in a poll said they believed Hawaii is not ready to open to tourists just yet. And polls show travelers themselves are most willing to take car trips to their vacation destination – rather than a long-haul flight to Hawaii – as it comes with less risk of spreading the virus.“The best economic policy at this point is really a health policy. It’s controlling the virus,” Bonham said. Tourists “are not going to sit on an airplane for five hours with a whole bunch of people who aren’t wearing masks”.“If you don’t deal with those issues, it doesn’t matter if the economy is open. That part of the economy won’t really recover.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7797ba4ab4ce5e8d625333b291531ecfff5c86a6/200_276_3982_2390/master/3982.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a32a02bea709b5641d8b81b9c116db8","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about going back to work","story":"We’d like to hear from people who have been shielding about their thoughts on returning to workFrom 1 August, those who have been shielding in England will be able to leave their homes to exercise, buy food and visit places of worship for the first time since March.They will also be able to return to work, rather than continue to work from home, as long as their place of employment is ‘Covid-secure’.If you have been shielding during the lockdown and are returning to work from August, we’d like to hear from you.How do you feel about retuning to your workplace after shielding for four months?

Then, in early June, a neighbour started harassing them.“It began quite lightly, with him being provocative whenever we met in the street,” the 38-year-old said. “Then he came to our home and forced his way in, calling us ‘dirty faggots’. My boyfriend managed to get rid of him but he returned with a baton and threw himself against the door, repeating the same insults and threatening to set us alight when we were asleep.”The man, who had recently moved into the same building, has incessantly taunted the couple over the past month, threatening to also torch their car. Marco has been recording evidence on his mobile phone, but his pleas to the police for help have so far been ignored.“We’re living in fear,” Marco said, citing the example of a gay friend who was almost killed by his antagonist following repeated harassment. “Twice the police came, and twice they did nothing.”The couple are hoping they will soon be protected by a long-awaited law that would punish discrimination and hate crimes towards LGBT people. Politicians will begin debating the draft legislation, already being virulently contested by far-right parties and religious groups, in parliament on Monday.“We need this law,” Marco said. “This guy came to us simply because he hates gays. This isn’t anything new, it happens to gay people all the time, but many do not report it through fear.”Attempts by various governments over the past three decades to enshrine gay rights in law have either been stifled or sabotaged. If approved, the new law would be an extension of an existing law that punishes racist violence, hatred and discrimination. In addition, it would criminalise misogyny.After a spate of recent attacks against gay people, proponents argue that the legislation is urgently needed. In late June, a 25-year-old man was brutally attacked by a gang of seven people as he walked hand-in-hand with his boyfriend in the city of Pescara. Less than two weeks later, a gay couple were assaulted by a group of six after they kissed each other at a train station in Cinque Terre, Liguria. At a recent demonstration in Rome in support of the law, two teenage girls, who were holding hands, were spat at and insulted by a man attending a nearby counter-protest organised by the League and its political partner, Brothers of Italy.“But many do not report the discrimination as their families do not know about their sexuality,” he added.Alessandro Zan, a gay politician with the Democratic party, part of the ruling coalition, and architect of the draft legislation, was threatened with death by an online opponent unless he withdrew the bill.Detractors, including Salvini and his Brothers of Italy counterpart, Giorgia Meloni, claim the law would suppress freedom of expression. At the protest in Rome, Salvini said: “I’m here to defend the right of a child to have a mother and a father … tomorrow I don’t want to be tried for defending family rights.” Meloni described Zan’s law as “a crime against opinion”.“The idea that the law would restrict free speech is such fake news,” said Zan. “The law works to fight discrimination, not limit the freedom of thought. They are using LGBT people as an enemy to fly an ideological flag and ignite hatred, rather than discuss the merits of the law.”The far-right parties are in sync with the Italian bishops’ conference, which said the bill would mark “the death of liberty”. A priest in Puglia recently held a vigil among parishioners to pray for the law’s failure. Another in Sicily who opposed the law said during a sermon: “If you express an opinion against homosexuals, or don’t agree with two men adopting a child, you could end up in jail.”“Those who attack it with such aggression are in the minority,” said Luisa Rizzitelli, an LGBT activist. “Italy is behind in respect of accepting ersity … but if we ask people if they want to make hatred against LGBT people a crime, I truly believe they would say yes.”Zan said: “While it is true that there is still strong homophobia, stemming from a patriarchal culture, the country has also made progress. If you look at the pride events across the country, they are full of young people and this gives hope that, in the future, citizens will be much more open.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e262f2f2578ca3eb574dbea02bf0e4d36c7d5f32/0_110_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a04c20114c609af2fbc898bad5e50d65","title":"moscows fruit stalls become frontline of a border skirmish 2000 miles away","story":"New violence between Armenia and Azerbaijan has provoked anger and boycotts throughout the two countries’ diasporasWhen Saribek Gevorkyan heard reports that Food City, a vast food distribution centre owned by entrepreneurs from Azerbaijan, had suddenly blocked Armenian farmers and turned away 50 truckloads of fresh apricots, he took action. He offered space for free in his own shopping centre to the farmers, helping to host a fruit rescue mission that its organisers have dubbed “Operation Apricot”.“We told our friends that in the Russian Federation nobody can close their doors to us Armenians,” boomed Gevorkyan, the owner of the Shelkovy Put (“Silk Way”) shopping centre. “The Russian Federation is open for everyone to come here, make money, and sell goods.”This month’s military clashes between Azerbaijan and Armenia, which left 17 people dead including a prominent Azeri general, were the worst in four years. Their aftershocks have rippled around the world, sparking violent skirmishes among diaspora communities in the US and Europe and a small-scale economic war in Moscow.The violence appears to be getting worse. In Moscow, Russian media reported that at least 25 people were arrested in a mass brawl late on Thursday night. Video footage appeared to show a group of men targeting the drivers of cars with Armenian licence plates. One Armenian man was reportedly stabbed during the attacks.Video also showed men with sticks storming an Azerbaijani restaurant in Moscow and an Azerbaijani fruit seller was also reportedly attacked. Members of both diaspora communities, as well as the Armenian embassy, have called for restraint.There have been a few hopeful moments. To save the freshly harvested apricots from spoiling, organisers in Moscow’s Armenian diaspora sent out an online alert on behalf of several shopping centres that had given free space to the farmers to sell their stock.The online messages attracted thousands of people, launching an impromptu celebration of the apricot, an Armenian staple. At one shopping centre, people danced a traditional kochari as buyers lugged away crates of fresh fruit.“It turned into quite a beautiful city festival,” said David Tonoyan, who helped organise the campaign. He said that many of the apricots went to charities, hospices and old people’s homes. “It had the effect to bring us closer together in the diaspora.”Asked by the Observer whether Food City had turfed out Armenian sellers, God Nisanov, the chairman of its parent company, Kievskaya Ploshchad, wrote that “following Russian law is an unconditional priority”, and that the company has “continuously demonstrated its care about the interests of consumers, partners and tenants regardless of their nationality or religious beliefs”.While the “apricot war” has ended, there are new reports of Azeri-run businesses barring Armenian products. On Thursday, the Armenian ambassador to Moscow told the news site RBC that Armenian canned foods, mineral water and cognac had all disappeared from a major Moscow supermarket chain owned by an Azeri businessman.The two countries have fought often, particularly in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, but it’s rare to see the conflict spill over into commerce in Moscow, where both countries have large diaspora communities.“Even in 2016 during the four-day war with Azerbaijan … there wasn’t this mood in Moscow. This economic war: there’s not been anything like it before,” said Tonoyan, the director of the Armenian Museum of Moscow and Culture of Nations.Experts have warned of a high risk of renewed fighting along the border between the two countries. Richard Giragosian, the founding director of the Regional Studies Centre thinktank in Yerevan, said it could be a “hot summer”.“To rely on political will and the situation on the battlefield for regional stability is dangerous,” he said. “There are no external security guarantees … this is a rare ceasefire that’s upheld only by parties to the conflict without any external actor.”In a new report, the International Crisis Group warns that the clashes “should serve as a warning and call to action”.Tonoyan said that he wanted to do more to protect Armenian farmers and other traders in Russia by helping to organise dedicated selling points.“We asked all Muscovites to come and help out the Armenian farmers, try some tasty apricots, take part in this flashmob and photograph themselves,” he said. “But we all understand this isn’t a permanent solution. So we’re thinking about what’s next.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3df4f9144671e10d4f980b360ee6390a504784fd/0_205_6144_3686/master/6144.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=473c434653d4c9ced33a6b006061fa71","title":"coronavirus live news global cases near 16m covid 19 ad blitz in victoria australia","story":"WHO says 1m cases reported per week for last five weeks Florida’s infections overtake New York’s North Korea holds emergency meeting after suspected Covid-19 case reportedSteve Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary has said Republican coronavirus relief legislation will be made public on Monday and that he believes the party can move quickly with Democrats to hammer out their differences.The most pressing issues are enhanced unemployment benefits that run out next week and liability protections from coronavirus-related lawsuits, Mnuchin said.“We can move very quickly with the Democrats on these issues. We’ve moved quickly before, and I see no reason why we can’t move quickly again,” Mnuchin said on Fox News’ Sunday programme.India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has warned citizens to be “extra vigilant” towards the persisting threat of Covid-19. Infections have risen rapidly across the world’s second most populous country, with more than 48,000 cases recorded in the last 24 hours. So far, India’s total coronavirus caseload is 1.4 million, while more than 30,000 people have died after contracting the disease.On Sunday, the government said 36,145 patients had recovered and been discharged from hospitals in the last 24 hours, marking a record number of single-day recoveries. However, at the same time a record number of tests in a single day – more than 440,000 – were conducted. During his monthly radio broadcast to the nation, Modi told citizens it was important to practice social distancing and wear face coverings to curb the spread of the virus. He said: The danger of corona is far from being over. At many places, it is spreading fast. We need to be extra vigilant.”In recent weeks, coronavirus infections have spread further into India’s countryside and smaller towns.The country’s official death toll includes people who were formally diagnosed with coronavirus, not suspected cases who were never tested.A lack of widespread testing, particularly in the early stages of the outbreak, means the official count could underestimate the virus’ toll, like in many other countries.By counting regional statistics of all suspected and confirmed fatalities from the virus, El Pais reached a total of 44,868 deaths. If accurate, that would make Spain’s outbreak the second deadliest in Europe after the UK.Spain’s health ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The El País figure is roughly in line with figures from the National Epidemiology Centre and National Statistics Centre (INE), which register excess mortality by comparing deaths across the country with historical averages.In June, the INE reported 43,945 more deaths in the first 21 weeks of 2020 than in the same period of 2019, though it could not say how many could be attributed to the pandemic.The Spanish government is focused on convincing Britain to exclude the Balearic and Canary islands from a 14-day quarantine it abruptly imposed on all travellers returning from Spain, Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said on Sunday.“Spain is safe, it is safe for Spaniards, it is safe for tourists,” Gonzalez Laya told reporters.She added that her government would take measures regarding other countries if needed, based on epidemilogic data, but that there would be no tit-for-tat retaliation taking place. Spain’s foreign ministry has insisted the coronavirus epidemic is under control, after the British government imposed a 14-day quarantine on all travellers returning from the country in response to a surge in new cases there.Hospitals are coping well with the increase in infections and more than half of new cases are asymptomatic, the ministry said, adding that outbreaks in Catalonia and Aragon should soon be brought under control.Vietnam has reported two more locally-transmitted cases of Covid-19, bringing the number of infections in the country to 420.The country has not reported any coronavirus-related deaths since the beginning of the pandemic.The new cases, reported on Sunday, were in the central province of Quang Ngai and in Danang city, the government said in the city.Social distancing measures were reimposed in Danang on Sunday following the detection of two other locally-transmitted coronavirus cases in the city.The social distancing measures would come into force until further notice, the government said on its website.Danang will stop receiving inbound tourists for 14 days and all religious, sports and cultural events will be suspended.In Latin America, a tsunami of fake news – including quack cures and conspiracies – on social media networks is harming efforts to fight Covid-19. Although the virus has claimed more than 160,000 lives in the region, a new battle against online disinformation designed to bamboozle and deceive has emerged.The misinformation streaming through millions of Latin American mobile phones and computers ranges from the bizarre to the ridiculous.In recent weeks, there have been claims that Brazilian coffins were being filled with rocks to inflate the country’s Covid-19 death toll that drones were being used to deliberately contaminate indigenous communities in Mexico that the CIA was helping spread the coronavirus in Argentina that seafood in northern Peru was not safe to eat because the corpses of Covid-19 victims were being dumped in the Pacific Ocean and even that the World Health Organization chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, had been spotted boogying and boozing at a bar on the São Paulo coast.You can read the full, fact-based report from my colleagues in Latin America here: The British government’s decision to pull Spain from the list of safe countries and require returning holidaymakers to self-isolate for a fortnight will come as a heavy blow to Spain’s lucrative and vital tourist sector.But the UK decision – combined with the French government’s advice against travelling to Catalonia, and Norway’s reimposition of a 10-day quarantine requirement for people arriving from Spain – is likely to torpedo Spain’s faltering tourist recovery.Belgium has also banned non-essential travel to the north-eastern areas of Huesca and Lleida, and recommended against travel to a number of other Spanish areas.You can read the full report here:Hurricane Hanna battered the south Texas coast into the early hours of Sunday, leaving a large area already badly hit by the coronavirus crisis bracing for torrential downpours and potential flash floods.The category 1 hurricane came ashore on Padre Island on Saturday afternoon, and later made a second landfall in Eastern Kennedy County, Texas.Weakening as it headed west over land, Hanna was a tropical storm by Sunday morning, with its centre about 40 miles (65 km) from Mcallen, Texas and about 65 miles (105 km) from Monterrey, Mexico, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.The hurricane’s top sustained winds were around 60 miles per hour. Although the NHC cancelled the storm surge warning it had issued for the Texas coast, it said said Hanna could dump upward of 18 inches of rain in the area through Monday.Texas Governor Greg Abbott said during a Saturday briefing that the storm was especially challenging as it was sweeping through an area of the state that has been the worst hit by the coronavirus.He issued a disaster declaration for 32 counties in Texas that were in the storm’s path.The Texas area struck by Hanna has struggled to contain outbreaks of COVID-19 in recent weeks. Cases along the state’s coast have soared into the tens of thousands.More than 400 people in Corpus Christi were hospitalised with the illness on Friday, according to city data.TUI, Europe’s biggest holiday company, has said it will cancel all holidays to mainland Spain up to and including Sunday 9 August following Britain’s decision to impose a quarantine on those returning from the country.In a statement published on Sunday, it said: TUI UK have taken the decision to cancel all holidays to mainland Spain up to and including Sunday 9th August 2020.”“We know how much our customers look forward to their holiday abroad and some will be able to accommodate the new quarantine restrictions. Therefore all those that wish to travel to the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands will be able to travel as planned from Monday 27th July.”Indonesia reported 1,492 new coronavirus infections on Sunday, bringing the country’s total caseload to 98,778, data from the Health Ministry website showed. The number of coronavirus-related deaths in Indonesia rose by 67, bringing the total to 4,781.British tourists flying home on Sunday from holidays in Spain reacted angrily to the UK government’s abrupt decision to impose a two-week coronavirus quarantine on everyone travelling from there.The move to take Spain off a safe-travel list was announced late on Saturday and took effect from midnight (2300 GMT on Saturday), leaving travellers with no time to dodge it or plan ahead.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government was slammed for its handling of the measure, taken as Spain sees a surge in COVID-19 cases.“I can understand why the government have made this decision ... but of course the way in which this decision has been made in the last 24 hours is frankly shambolic,” said the Labour Party’s health policy chief, Jonathan Ashworth, speaking to Sky News.At Madrid’s Barajas airport Emily Harrison, from Essex, was taking a flight to London and faced the prospect of having to self-isolate for two weeks.“We had a wedding to go to and we had plans to visit friends and family who we haven’t seen in a very long time and now we are going to have to cancel all those plans, so it’s really quiet upsetting,” she told Reuters.Spain has seen cases rise in the last few weeks, prompting most regions to impose rules for masks to be worn everywhere and, in several areas including Barcelona, calls for people to stay at home.“We’re quite frustrated by it to be honest, because it actually feels safer in Spain,” said British tourist Carolyne Lansell, who was flying to Ibiza from Madrid for a 10-day holiday before going home.A Spanish Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said on Saturday evening that Spain “respects decisions of the United Kingdom” and was in touch with the authorities there.New South Wales’ Ministry of Health has put out an alert to the public following new confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia. On Sunday, the country recorded 10 new deaths from the virus, its highest ever daily tally. They occurred in the state of Victoria, which also recorded 459 new Covid-19 cases.New South Wales reported 14 new cases, bringing its total cases to 3,279. In the public warning, NSW Health directed anyone who attended the Thai Rock Restaurant at Potts Point for two hours or more between Wednesday 15 July and Saturday 25 July to be immediately tested for coronavirus and to self-isolate for 14 days since they were last there, regardless of symptoms. It added: This new advice follows investigation into a case announced last week who had reported attending Thai Rock Potts Point on Friday, 17 July.“A staff member at the restaurant has now tested positive, and the venue has been closed for cleaning. Investigations into the source of the infection and contact tracing are under way.“The Thai Rock Potts Point has the same owners as Thai Rock Wetherill Park, which has now been linked to 67 cases of COVID, but investigations to date have not identified links between cases at the two sites.”Additionally, people who attended AN Restaurant in Bankstown on 23 July, and Tan Viet Noodle House in Cabramatta on 22 July, were asked to monitor for symptoms after a couple tested positive for the virus after visiting the venues.Russia reported 5,765 new coronavirus cases and 77 more related deaths on Sunday, a steep decline from the 146 deaths reported a day earlier.The nationwide tally of infections has risen to 812,485, the country’s coronavirus crisis response centre said. The Covid-19 death toll now stands at 13,269 and 600,250 people have recovered.Following the UK’s decision to impose a 14-day quarantine on travellers from Spain, newspaper El País has noted that the number of coronavirus cases and deaths in Britain are “much higher” than in Spain.“Downing Street has not vowed to cover the expense of all those unable to return to work when they return to the UK, and has limited itself to asking companies to be sympathetic to their employees in the new situation.”The UK government’s decision means those coming back from Spain will have to self­-isolate for two weeks upon their return. The move, a blow to the government’s travel corridor scheme, followed a dramatic increase in the virus in Spain where nearly 1,000 infections have been reported in the past two days.In a twist, Grant Shapps, the UK’s transport secretary who has been instrumental in drawing up the air corridor plans, was understood to be already holidaying in Spain, or to be in the process of travelling there.Since the beginning of the pandemic, the UK has reported 300,270 cases of Covid-19 and 45,823 deaths, while Spain has reported 272,421 cases and 28,432 deaths according to John Hopkins University.On Friday, Spanish deputy emergency health director, Maria Jose Sierra, said the increase in cases in the country “could be a second wave”.Vietnam has reintroduced social distancing measures in the city of Danang after a second locally-transmitted Covid-19 case was detected there, more than three months after any infections were reported in the country.Vietnam is back on high alert after the government confirmed its first community infection since April on Saturday, and another case on Sunday, both in tourist hotspot Danang. Authorities are yet to announce details on how the infections were contracted and if they are believed to be linked. In a statement on its website the government said social distancing measures would come into force in the city until further notice. Danang will stop receiving inbound tourists for 14 days, while all religious, sports and cultural events have been suspended.Wearing masks in public places in the city is now compulsory and gatherings of more than 30 people at public places were banned, the government said.The total of cases in the country so far is 418, with no deaths. The impressively low figures are believed to be because of its strict quarantine measures and widespread testing programme. More than 550 elderly care residents and staff have been infected with coronavirus in the Australian state of Victoria, as authorities dismiss calls for all those who test positive to be transferred to hospital.Victoria recorded its deadliest day of the pandemic on Sunday, with seven of its 10 deaths linked to outbreaks at aged care facilities. The deaths take the state’s toll from the virus to 71 and the national figure to 155.There are currently 560 active COVID-19 cases linked to residents and staff of at least 40 homes across the state, including 82 cases at Estia Health in Ardeer and 78 at St Basil’s Homes for the Aged in Fawkner. The crisis prompted the federal and state governments to set up a response centre to coordinate efforts to curb the virus spread on Saturday. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Nick Coatsworth said all agencies needed to work together to bring things under control as quickly as possible. “This is a challenge that we all need to work together to meet quickly for the safety of those who are vulnerable and dependent on care within aged care facilities in Victoria,” he told reporters in Canberra on Sunday.Dr Coatsworth dismissed calls by community groups and aged care providers to transfer all COVID-19-positive residents to hospital. He said decisions needed to be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the resident’s medical needs and clinical advice. “Every single outbreak is different in regards to COVID-19. It affects different facilities in different sorts of ways when we’re talking about aged care,” he said. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has declared an emergency and a lockdown in a border town after a person suspected of having Covid-19 illegally crossed the border from South Korea.State media confirmed it would be the first case to be officially acknowledged by North Korean authorities. An emergency politburo meeting was convened in response to what Kim called a “critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country”, the North’s KCNA state news reported.A person who defected to South Korea three years ago returned across the fortified border that ides the two Koreas to the town of Kaesong this month with coronavirus symptoms, the disease caused by the virus, according to KCNA.“An emergency event happened in Kaesong City where a runaway who went to the south three years ago, a person who is suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus returned on July 19 after illegally crossing the demarcation line,” KCNA said.KCNA did not say if the person had been tested, but said an “uncertain result was made from several medical check-ups of the secretion of that person’s upper respiratory organ and blood”, prompting officials to quarantine the person and investigate anyone he may have been in contact with.I’m Amy Walker, taking over the global coronavirus blog for the next few hours.That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, on a particularly troubling day.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillAn increasing number of Dubliners are dumping their domestic rubbish in public bins while a three-fold increase in waste has been detected in parks during the coronavirus pandemic, according to Dublin City Council. Staff noticed at least two to three times more rubbish than normal being dumped in parks during the Covid-19 lockdown, the council said.In addition, more people have started stuffing bags of domestic rubbish into public bins since movement restrictions were introduced earlier this year.“There has been an increase in the practice of people stuffing bags of domestic refuse into the openings of our litterbins,” the council said.It added that this gives the impression that the bins have been left to overflow over a long period of time.“In fact, these bins might only be quarter full. To offset this problem, Waste Management Services will continue to prioritise the emptying of our bins as frequently as possible. Our Parks Division are experiencing the same problem.”The council added: “The extended period of fine weather and Covid restrictions have resulted in large numbers visiting parks in the area over recent weeks. “Staff are spending a large portion of their working day collecting waste. We estimate conservatively that we are collecting two to three times the normal volume of waste we would be normally expect to in our parks.“How we manage the collection and disposal of waste in the park is reviewed regularly, and additional Big Belly Bins will be installed over the coming weeks.”The issue was raised at a June meeting of the council’s South East Area Committee by councillor Anne Feeney who asked for more frequent emptying of bins on streets and parks “as they are regularly overflowing, particularly at weekends”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Spain restriction highlights the benefits of \u0026lsquostaycationing\u0026rsquo, says SDLP Assembly memberT\u0026aacutenaiste also asserts that the monitoring of international travel needs to \u0026lsquotighten up\u0026rsquoRisk of spot flooding in multiple counties including Laois, Cork, Tipperary and CarlowPremises in Belfast targeted in two separate robberies on Saturday, according to PSNIMinister says he can \u0026lsquounderstand the anger\u0026rsquo of some at salary hikes for Ministers of StateBritish transport secretary Grant Shapps flew to Spain on Monday for holidayAnnual August National novena at Knock is postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemicGarda\u0026iacute find \u0026euro7,000 in cash, mobile phones and drug paraphernalia during operationDriver of van (50s) pronounced dead at scene following collision on Saturday afternoonLockdown sees \u0026lsquothree-fold increase\u0026rsquo in the amount of waste left in public parksSuspect in his 40s arrested after barricading himself into a nearby house in ClonsillaOut-of-control lorry overturns on Ferrycarrig Bridge, hitting unoccupied parked carFinancial aid package worth almost \u0026euro300m for sector will cover any losses, says MinisterNumber of coronavirus patients who have died in the Republic now stands at 1,764Council move comes to encourage people back into city for shopping and entertainmentFirm behind popular TV show criticises \u0026lsquolack of correct support\u0026rsquo for creative industriesSome people may be \u0026lsquoletting their guards down\u0026rsquo, says a covid-19 contact tracer in GalwayTalks ongoing between two departments about which should drive national strategyStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4313844.1595764593!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"donohoe says salary top ups need to be seen in context of stimulus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said he could understand the anger at the pay rise for Ministers of State.

Theme parks, beauty salons, bars and clubs were also ordered to shut.On Sunday, a 61-year-old man was confirmed to be infected, a day after a 57-year-old tested positive for the coronavirus. Both are in a critical condition and require life support.A team of doctors who successfully cured a British pilot of Covid-19 flew to Da Nang to direct the treatment of the two patients.Health workers, however, have not been able to establish a connection between the two men, nor trace the source of infection. It was reported that they had not travelled out of the city, where there have been no cases since April, for the last month.Tested negativeSeveral hundred people who had been in contact with the men have initially tested negative for the virus. The city has also started testing on a larger scale.Vietnam has not allowed international commercial fights to resume, but has been operating repatriation fights for stranded Vietnamese overseas and international experts. All arrivals must go through quarantine at designated facilities.The new infections take Vietnam’s cases to 418 with no deaths.China reported 46 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, the highest daily tally in more than a month, as it took steps to stem recent outbreaks that have infected more than 160 people at opposite ends of the country.Authorities confirmed 22 cases in Urumqi, a city in the Xinjiang region in the country’s far west, the official Xinhua News Agency said. That took the total in the local outbreak to 137 since the first case was detected 10 days ago.Another 13 cases were confirmed in Liaoning province in the north-east, taking the total there to 25, almost all in the city of Dalian.The National Health Commission also reported 11 imported cases in the latest 24-hour period, in people who had arrived from overseas.China has recorded 83,830 cases and 4,634 deaths since the pandemic began. The Health Commission said that 288 patients remain in treatment, including 18 in a critical condition.In Australia, Victoria state recorded 10 deaths overnight — its highest daily toll amid a continuing surge in cases.State premier Daniel Andrews said the deaths included seven men and three women.

Photograph:   Robert PerryPA WireBritain’s refusal to compromise on fisheries and level playing field guarantees of fair competition have made a trade agreement unlikely, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said on Thursday. Speaking at the end of a round of talks in London, Mr Barnier said that although there was some progress in certain areas there was none on the key issue of a level playing field on state aid.“By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely,” he said.Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost blamed the EU, asserting that its proposals did not respect the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a meeting with the presidents of the EU institutions last month.“Considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas, that is, the so-called level playing field and on fisheries.\u0026nbspWe have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period,” he said.Mr Frost said the EU had listened to Britain’s concerns about the role of the European Court of Justice in any future agreement and Britain has dropped its demand for a complex suite of separate agreements like those the EU has with Switzerland. However, the issue of state aid remains a stumbling block, and Mr Barnier complained on Thursday that Britain had not yet published details of the state aid regime it plans to introduce from January next year.“We have no visibility on the UK’s intention on its future domestic subsidy control regime. We respect the UK political debate but the time for answers is quickly running out,” he said.A senior British official close to the talks dismissed Mr Barnier’s demand for details of the state aid regime, and said Britain would not commit to any regime as part of its treaty with the EU.“We’re a bit puzzled by this, to be honest, because we don’t quite see why. What is significant about the subsidy regime compared to lots of other areas of domestic policy? “They aren’t asking us to pre-publish in these areas or to kind of pre-commit to future agreements forever in the treaty. And we don’t really see why this is the case either in this area. All we need is a mechanism to resolve disputes between you if there are felt to be unfair subsidies,” the official said.“We’re not going to pre-commit to a particular kind of regime in the treaty with the EU. That’s just not how we’re going to do things.” Second referendumDuring a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Mr Johnson was met by protesters calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence. During a visit to Orkney and the north of Scotland, the prime minister said the response to the coronavirus had shown the strength of the union.However, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon , who has won praise for her handling of the pandemic, said Mr Johnson should not be exploiting it to make a political point.“I don’t think any of us should be championing or celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political case we want to make.

Officially, he was removed for failing to deal with issues in the newsroom. But the editor’s supporters said the sacking was “clear interference” and an attempt to pressure the news site to toe a pro-government line.Fears over the future of Index were ignited in March when Miklos Vaszily, businessman that backs prime minister Viktor Orbán, bought a 50 per-cent stake in the firm that controls Index’s advertising and revenue. Although Mr Vaszily denies wanting to exert any editorial influence, his critics claim that he helped transform Origo, another Hungarian website, into a pro-government organisation.Once news of the mass resignation from Index broke, protesters took to the streets in Budapest on Friday evening.Addressing the demonstrators Andras Fekete-Gyor, leader of Momentum, an opposition party, said the “journalists of Index had demonstrated the value of having a moral backbone in this country.”But the protests may have little effect. Mr Orban and his party have a strong position in the Hungarian parliament, and in the past have proved impervious to the frequent accusations that they are undermining Hungarian democracy. The Hungarian government has also always denied that it poses a threat to the country’s free media.Marianna Bíró, a journalist at Index told The Sunday : Today, the political power in Hungary denies the function of journalists. The media only has one weapon left in this massacre: decency.”Balázs Pándi, another employee who walked out, said: This isn\u0027t the first time a cold shower has been deployed. The question is how long this will be tolerated.”Index has become regarded as a bastion of independent journalism in a Hungarian media landscape increasingly dominated by print and broadcast media with close ties to Fidesz, the governing party led by Viktor Orban, the prime minister.The hollowing out of independent media inside Hungary comes amid a push to spread Mr Orban\u0027s message abroad, uncovered today by The Sunday .An investigation found a slew of English-language websites promoting the message and illiberal philosophy of Mr Orban, raising fears that Hungary is following in the “disinformation” footsteps of authoritarian governments.Alleged propaganda websites, with connections to the Hungarian government, masquerade as legitimate news sources, purporting to bring Hungarian and regional news to an international audience.Remix News, one of the websites in question, is, for example, often linked to from the About Hungary Facebook page, which is run by the Hungarian state.Based in Budapest it is, according to its own information, an organisation that offers “news and commentary from Central Europe”. But to its critics it is one of a number of websites with opaque backgrounds allegedly spreading propaganda supporting the government of Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, beyond Hungary’s borders while posing as legitimate news sources.Their presence has prompted allegations that Hungary is following in the footsteps of autocratic regimes such as Russia, Iran and China by using bogus news websites to disseminate pro-government stories.“Hungary has become a regional disinformation power, and certainly Hungary is expanding its own misinformation machinery,” said Szabolcs Panyi, a journalist working for Direkt36, a non-profit investigative journalism centre in Budapest. “I’m not aware of a similar country doing this apart from the likes of Russia and China.”A quick click away from Remix is V4NA. A UK-registered company founded in 2018 by Hungary’s then ambassador to London it turns out stories each day, many of which share a similar theme to those found on Remix. Articles attacking migration, the EU and George Soros, the Hungarian-born financier whom the Orban government regards as an enemy of state, proliferate.The stories reflect issues that lie close to the heart of the Hungarian government. Since coming into power in 2010 Mr Orban’s Fidesz party has become a resolute opponent of migration, a fierce critic of Brussels and Mr Soros, and a proponent of what the prime minister has termed “illiberal democracy”.This has led to frequent clashes with Brussels and prompted widespread allegations that the Hungarian government is intent on eroding democratic norms and civil society in order to shape the country to its ideological designs—something it strenuously denies.“Orban plays to an international field, and he needs international allies in his fight against the EU,” said Agnes Urban, a media analyst at the Hungarian media watchdog Mertek Media Monitor. “This pro-government narrative about Hungary helps communicate his anti-democratic views.Barna Borbas, a Hungarian journalist who has written extensively about V4NA for the conservative newspaper Valasz Online, believes V4NA’s “goal is to make the messages and strategic goals of the Hungarian government more visible in Europe”.This is perhaps not surprising given that Arpad Harbony, one of Mr Orban’s key advisors and man sometimes called the “Hungarian Dominic Cummings”, has a share in V4NA, while V4NA’s parent company is part of the Central European Press and Media Foundation, a media-holding containing a number of pro-government newspapers and radio stations in Hungary. V4NA failed to respond to an interview request from The .Remix is owned by FWD Affairs, a “strategic communications and media agency” in Budapest, founded in 2010 by Patrick Egan, an American political consultant. Although appearing to keep a low profile in Hungary he has spoken at a number of events linked to Fidesz, which are, according to one expert on Hungarian affairs who preferred not to be named, the “darkest chambers of governmental propaganda”.In the past FWD Affairs has also carried out work for the prime minister’s office, winning, for example, a contract in 2015 “to support international communications activities”.Along with publishing Remix it also handles the English-language editing of a Hungarian-state backed website called Transylvania Now. Although designed primarily to promote Romania’s Transylvania region, which was once part of Hungary and still home to a large Hungarian population, the website has political content, often critical of the Romanian authorities while supporting the Hungarian government.Like V4NA, FWD is also a company that appears to shun publicity. Its website consists of one page, and offers no contact information other than a box in which to write a message. It also made no response to attempts by The  to contact it.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"stuart wheeler measured palpable difference made world","story":"People were often caught off-guard by Stuart Wheeler’s modesty. On paper, he seemed like a character from a James Bond film. He began life as a professional gambler, winning money in Mayfair clubs from, among others, Lord Lucan, Omar Sharif and, indeed, Ian Fleming. He saw the potential in spread betting, establishing the IG Index, and selling it for £90 million in 2003 – prematurely, as it turned out, for the price went on to rise a further 1500 per cent. He made what still stands, 20 years on, as the single largest political donation in British history, giving £5 million to the Conservatives when, under William Hague, they were at their lowest ebb.It could come as quite a surprise to meet the gentle, diffident, stooping figure in the flesh. Stuart, who died this week at the age of 85, was an astonishingly self-effacing man. He gave generously to a number of causes and never wanted anything in return except detailed information on how his money was being used. Asked on live television whether he expected a peerage for his £5 million, he amiably replied that, no thank you, he would decline any such offer if it were made.He pursued his enthusiasms quietly and politely, but with astonishing tenacity. He backed a number of pro-market think-tanks, often sitting in the audience at their events as an ordinary subscriber. He had a particular hatred of torture, and donated huge sums to help eradicate the practice. He was an early Eurosceptic, funding the campaign to keep the pound. When David Cameron dropped his promise of a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, he switched to UKIP, serving as that party’s treasurer. When the referendum itself came, though, he threw his resources behind Vote Leave rather than the UKIP-backed rival campaign.Stuart took immense pleasure in entertaining at Chilham Castle, an exquisite Kentish Jacobean mansion where, among other things, he would host annual outdoor performances by the Royal Shakespeare Company. Some of his happiest times as a young man had been spent as a guest at a country house and, when he sold his business, he decided to recreate that atmosphere himself.Chilham became a kind of Blandings Castle, a place of innocent, almost idyllic, pleasure. Eclectic people would congregate there while Stuart, who was latterly very deaf, would potter about grinning, taking palpable delight in his guests’ pleasure. There would be games, usually Racing Demon (“the only card game where women seem to have a natural advantage”). And there would be a wide range of political opinions for, until his dying day, Stuart never lost the belief that he could learn from people with whom he disagreed.In an age when “party donor” has become almost an insult, Stuart’s story reminds us that there is a fundamental decency and patriotism in choosing to spend your money on good causes rather than on yourself. He measured himself by the palpable difference he made to the world. And, by that metric, he was extraordinarily successful. A gambler to the end, he made a calculated bet on Brexit, and lived just long enough to see it come off. That, for Stuart, was reward enough.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/21/15/5.-kiss-you-video-still.jpg","title":"celebrate 10 years of one direction with spotifys new platform experiences","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Calling all 1D stans!

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track.

Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism.

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

Today we are taking one more step on the road towards giving women a voice and eradicating these harmful practices,” the future prime minister pledged.The unit has been funded through the Department for Education’s children’s social care innovation programme.Since 2015, it has supported more than 1,000 survivors or potential victims of FGM and secured 41 applications for protection orders, which can force the surrender of passports or other travel documents.Around 18,000 social workers, teachers, police and legal professionals have been trained by the centre. In October 2017, its remit was expanded to include breast flattening and child abuse linked to faith or belief.The closure threat is revealed after evidence of an explosion in cases of forced marriage and honour-based abuse during the lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Karma Nirvana, a group training the police, NHS and social services, reported a 200 per cent surge in helpline calls in March and April.A government spokesperson said funding for the centre was “time-limited while we worked on more permanent solution to tackle this terrible practice”.“We have also introduced tough safeguarding laws to compel certain professionals to report if they have encountered cases of FGM in under 18s, provided funding for charities to support victims of FGM and, through our new relationships, health and sex education curriculum, we are teaching pupils about the emotional and physical damage of FGM in an age-appropriate way, as well as teaching that it is a crime,” the spokesperson said.Department for Education\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.7 great summer days out for the familyThe team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers.

He video FaceTimed me and he was in Wyoming with a bunch of friends. He seemed fine on the call. But it sounds like things are, you know, not fine.

There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now make another cm cut that runs parallel to the bottom to make a rectangle that can be thrown away.Step four: Now, to make the ties that secure the mask you need two long strips of fabric. Then unfold the main piece of fabric and place over the mouth and nose to secure. This then needs to be tied around the head and around the neck.The government has ordered that people entering shops must now wear face masks - and those flouting the law in England could face a £ fine.The new mandatory measure came into force from Friday, July  as a way to stop people spreading the virus post-lockdown, with most businesses now reopen to the public - provided they are Covid-secure.Shopkeepers have been told to report lawbreaking customers to cops - but officers have warned it will be impossible to police.The new Covid- rule comes after ministers were criticised for contradicting each other on the need for masks.Boris Johnson said wearing a mask while shopping is a vital insurance policy to stop a second wave of coronavirus.The Government is asking people to wear a simple face covering, and not to buy up PPE standard medical masks as they are still needed for the NHS.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes. For further details of our complaints policy and to make a complaint please click here."},{"url":null,"title":"how make face mask mandatory rules","story":"As of Friday, July , it is now compulsory to cover your mouth and nose while shopping in stores, as well as other locations such as stations and on public transport.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesBrits now have to wear face masks when entering shops - or face being fined.Face coverings are also mandatory on trains, buses, ferries, and aircraft to prevent a second peak of coronavirus in the UK.And while there are many good sources to bulk buy masks for a reasonable price, you can never beat a cost-cutting DIY expedition. Health officials have strongly urged the public not to buy up surgical masks, which are vital for frontline health workers to protect themselves while treating patients.Instead, Brits have been advised to try making their own at home version.Homemade masks wont offer the same protection as medical-grade masks, but experts say they still work to some level.One of the simplest ways to make one at home is to use paper you already have at home - just take two layers of kitchen roll and one tissue cut in half.You then cover each end with masking tape, punch two holes in and thread elastic or a hair tie through to fit around your ears.If you want to stfen it so that it is more secure you can add some wire into the ends before taping them up.Another method involves using a T-shirt without the need for any sewing or stitching.A YouTube tutorial by Runa Ray explains that for the t-shirt method, you need to cut out a in by in rectangle from the material.Then fold it in half and measure in on either side before making an equal number of cuts along the edges with scissors.Then turn the fabric inside out and knot each of the tails, but leave the four outer edges.Cut two more strips of material and tie them to the ends - these are the straps that will go around your ears.Some people have also used a vacuum cleaner bag to create a face mask, which is a bit more complicated - and only worksyou have a spare, clean bag to hand.The Government has also released \" href\"https:www.gov.uk government publications how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"instructions on how to make a face mask from a T-shirt.You dont have to make your own homemade face mask to keep yourself safe. A face covering can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.It should cover your mouth and nose while allowing you to breathe comfortably. Before putting your face mask on, wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and repeat after taking it off. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose. Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched.You should wash a face covering regularly - it can go in with other laundry, using your normal detergent.The Government says that face coverings should not be used by children under the age of three or those who may find it dficult to manage them correctly.For example, primary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions.Children should also only wear a face mask under the supervision of an adult.People with disabilites, breathing dficulties and children are exempt from wearing face masks in stores and on public transport. These people have been asked to download an exemption card from the TfL website so that they can show staff when asked about wearing a face covering.Experts are still pretty ided on their effectiveness outside of a medical setting.Wearing a mask can act as a physical barrier to prevent infecting othersyou are sick by blocking the droplets that come out when you cough or sneeze.The Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies that is advising the government said the evidence that masks slow the spread is marginal but positive.But some experts argue that people can accidentally infect themselves when taking a mask off or they can lead to complacency with other measures such as hand-washing.As soon as you touch the mask having put it on it becomes redundant, some say.New evidence from Hong Kong about face masks has been shared confidentially with the World Health Organisation.The data hasnt been made public yet but it reportedly suggests that the protective gear was effective in slowing the spread in Asian countries.Professor Susan Michie, of University College London, said there is not good evidence to suggest wearing masks will cut transmissions.She said: They do not protect against the virus getting into the eyes - only close fitting goggles do this.People may not fit the masks properly or take them on and off. Touching face masks and not taking them off in the correct way may mean people contaminate their hands and spread the virus.People may have a  sense of reassurance and thus pay less attention to other behaviours key to reducing transmission such as social distancing and hand-washing.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, reviewed  studies which looked at the efficacy of face masks in preventing respiratory illness.He said the research was poor, adding that it was as easy to make an argument for opposing the widespread use of masks as it would be to make an argument promoting their use.Most experts are in agreement that for masks to work as they are intended, they must be used correctly.Dr Jenna Macciochi, a lecturer in immunology at the University of Sussex, told the Mail: To be effective, a mask has to be fitted correctly, worn correctly and disposed of correctly — which is not something the general public has been trained in.She added that not wearing one correctly is potentially more hazardous than not using one at all, as you may infect yourself with the particles the mask is protecting you against when you take it off.The WHO says surgical masks can only help when used with other preventative measures such as frequent hand-washing.Face masks were made mandatory for people to wear on public transport from June  and people are now required to wear masks in shops, which came into force from July .On July , Matt Hancock confirmed it would be mandatory for people in England to wear face masks in shops.Anyone spotted flouting the new rules could be hit with a £ fine. Shopkeepers have been asked to implement the new rules in their stores.Passengers on public transport have already been told to wear masks when travelling, with commuters refused travelthey arent wearing oneTransport Secretary Grant Shapps has urged people to only wear face coverings - such as a scarf, piece of cloth or mask - and not surgical masks which should be reserved for health staff.Commuters should expect to see signs at stations and transport hubs outlining the new rules.Speaking on May , the UK Governments chief scientic adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said wearing face masks had a marginal but positive impact on the spread of infection.Where masks may have a role is where distancing isnt possible, where there might be undue crowding, he added.But Sir Patrick says wearing a mask should not replace social distancing and hand washing - which are both vital.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You must vote Leave in that referendum.”I said to him: “Excuse me, sorry for asking, but are you a Russian ”He looked aghast and said: “Nyet! Why would you think that ”And I said: “Because you speak funny, you have borscht on your tie and you’re glowing, in a radioactive manner, slightly.”He went off around the pub saying the same thing to everyone . Later, I saw him with a bottle of vodka in one hand doing that dance where you crouch down and kick your legs out and shout “ha!” every so often. I wandered up. “Are you SURE you’re not a Russian ”There’s vodka dribbling down his chin and he smells of piroshki dumplings and isotopes. “Nyet! I am Englyishman. My name is Jyohn Smeeth.Definitely not Russian, definitely not KGB, my frent.”“Oh, OK,” I said, “No worries, good night.”“Dosvedanya, toich,” he replied.OK, that didn’t quite happen. But the remainers have got it into their heads that something like it did. We all voted Leave because the Russians interfered in our referendum. Meddled with our democratic process. Which is why we should stop leaving and have another vote.The allegation is that the Russkies tried to persuade us to vote leave by spreading  news around.What  news was that  That the European Union is an authoritarian bureaucracy run by pygmies from Luxembourg  That the EU wanted ever-closer political control over our country That we spent enormous sums of money keeping gibbering oafs like Jean Claude Juncker in office, while subsidising the useless states of Europe I don’t knowspecial agents Ivan and Dmitri were putting that stuff around, but I was well aware of the fact long beforethey were.Is there anything anyone can point to which suggests that the Russkies had an effect  There’s an allegation that they tried to ensure that the Scots voted for independence from the UK. And we should all vote for Jeremy Corbyn in the  election. Not hugely successful meddling operations, then, were they The thing about the alleged Brexit meddling is that it plays into the same narrative the remainers have been peddling for four years. We were all thick, us leavers. We voted Leave because we were DUPED. First by Boris and Nigel Farage. And now by the devilish Russians. Too dense to understand we were being conned, we voted Leave.Looking at the EU today, I’ve never been happier that we voted to get the hell out, incidentally.I have no doubt the Russians meddle in our affairs. I very much hope our own cyber spies are doing the same thing to them. I know the CIA is up to all sorts of tricks.Russia is not a very pleasant country right now and we should complain when it crosses the line — which it does, every month or so. But the idea that it had a decisive effect in our Brexit referendum is an insult to all those of us who thought long and hard and then voted Leave.The remainers can’t get over that we did so. They cannot bear to be defied. Tough. It wasn’t the Russians wot won it. It was us, the ordinary people of this fine country.And we’re still very glad we did.COVID has been good for some people. A lot of better- off people have been able to save loads of money, for example. And they don’t come much better off than the boss of Amazon, Jeff Bezos.Jeff has seen his income rise by a very agreeable £billion. That’s kind of enough money to buy France. So how about this, Jeffrey How about you get your company to pay the right amount of income tax in countries where you make so much money, such as the UK Last year Amazon did £billion worth of business in the UK – and paid £million in tax. That’s a tax rate, then, of two per cent.Not right, is it GOB on a very strange stick Janet Street Porter has been screeching about men. Again.She was having a go at Prince Andrew. Well, fair enough. The bloke is neither use nor ornament. And may soon be up to his neck in legal problems.I agree with the first part of what the toothy old harridan had to say. “Prince Andrew has no skills, no mates and no redeeming features.”Yup, largely agree, pet. But then she went on: “And so many modern middle-agedblokes are like that. That’s why women have drinks parties with their mates on Zoom, binge watch Netflix . . . and only laugh when they’re talking to gay men or their girlfriends.”She ended up by saying that men were becoming “redundant”.Can you imagine the outrageI had a go at a spectacularly useless woman – Janet Street Porter, for example.And then said most women were like her and that women in general are becoming redundant Ooh, there’d be howls of outrage.A LECTURER who said Jewish people had high intelligence has been sacked.Stephen Lamonby also said that Germans were good at engineering. For this – expelled. No job any more.Here’s the thing. Jewish people make up . per cent of the world’s population. And  per cent of Nobel Prize winners, like Bob Dylan, pictured.Countless studies have been done which show that Ashkenazi Jews have what one researcher, called, “the primo gene”. A high intellect. And Germans – well, they have been good at engineering, haven’t they Engineering Daily ranked countries in order of their prow-ess in the field. Germany came top. The magazine said: “Germany has long stood the test of time to emerge as a champion in the engineering field, reputed for its technical universities, internships and perhaps a culture and an economy that rewards engineering skills with both prestige and career growth.”Telling the truth, then, can now cost you your job. This moronic terror of the truth now infests most of our institutions. It has to stop.DAVID and Mary Sheldon took their newborn baby boy to the register office.And then got very upset. The registrar complained about their choice of name for the kid. Said it might cause him problems getting a job, later on.The Sheldons were very angry, but eventually got their way. The name they chose for their son  Lucer. Yep, that’s right, the Prince of Darkness.

Then smothered in creamy bechamel sauce. And then with loads of Red Leicester on top of that.You eat it with chips and it’s , calories.

Do it NOW.Quarantine for everyone arriving from Spain. Don’t make the same mistake you made in March. Back then there were NO restrictions on people from Covid hotspots – .million people arrived here up until lockdown.And that’s why we have one of the worst virus death rates in the world. Be quicker off the mark, Boris. Keep us safe.THE BBC will not rest until all the statues of Winston Churchill are torn down and his memory besmirched.Earlier this week the corporation broadcast a semi-literate tirade of abuse about Churchill’s “racism” and supposed brutality towards Indians.It was by a woman called Yogita Limaye. There was no discussion about the matter. Churchill was a racist, and that’s that. Also he caused the deaths of three million people in Bengal through a famine in .As it happens, the famine was caused by a tropical cyclone. These pieces were not “news” and so should not have been on The Ten O’Clock News. Andthey were to appear anywhere they should have been balanced. They were not balanced.Another case of the BBC virtue- signalling its wokeness.

But no one’s paying the slightest bit of attention.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesHand sanitiser  That’s what homeless people drink, isn’t it People roar up to me all the time, flinging their arms round my shoulders and asking for a selfie. And they look genuinely perplexed when I ask them politely to back up a bit.At the TV studios where I’m working, there’s a one-way system that’s not being used, electronic ­temper- ature checks that are covered in cobwebs and endless signs telling people to keep apart. Which no one can read because of the huddle they’re in.At breakfast in the hotel where I’m staying, no one’s wearing a mask and in the city’s restaurants it’s business as usual.The only slight change is that because so many are working from home, the girls have plenty of spare time to take off even more clothes than usual before going out.Face masks  Ha. You must be ­joking. They’re not wearing anything at all.The problem is that social distancing simply doesn’t work in the North, where people are naturally friendly. Asking a Manc to scuttle about with his head down and his eyes locked in the straight-ahead position is like asking a fish to tap-dance.They’re also a pretty sensible bunch. Did you know thatsomeone had the virus in March, and was killed last week by falling out of a tree, they are still chalked up as a “Covid death”  Well they do up here. They know that this pandemic is a wave that’s passed.In London and the South East, meanwhile, it’s a very dferent story. There are Covid Nazis at every turn, telling people to keep apart and everyone is happy to oblige.Face masks are everywhere and no one is punctual for their Zoom calls because they’ve just spent two hours washing their hands.There’s a simple reason for this. In London, no one has ever wanted to talk to their neighbour and now they have an excuse.The reaction to Covid is almost tailor-made for the capital. Because all the guidelines are basically giving people permission to do what they’ve always done.“What  No one is allowed to sit next to me on the Tube  Excellent.”On balance, I’ve got to say, I ­prefer it in Manchester.LAST autumn was the wettest for  years. The spring was the hottest and driest ever. And July is on course to be the coldest for  years.It seems that every single day a new weather record is broken, which suggests the climate is changing.Which makes me wonder. Why did no one see this coming Andthey did, why were they so quiet about it Yes, and now he’s the Democratic candidate in this year’s presidential elections.HAVING done Covid- vaccine tests on , ­volunteers, a team of ­British boffins in Oxford has announced that the initial results are “encouraging”.That’s pathetic. “Encouraging” is completely the wrong word. It’s what teachers write on a fat kid’s school report after he’s managed to come second to last in the  metres sack race.The fact is that Oxford is in a fight to develop this vaccine with an American biotech company, and you can be certain Hank won’t ever describe his progress as “encouraging”.He’s already said it’s “robust” and soon he’ll be saying his medicine “kicks ass” and that it’s “hammer time”. Evenit’s causing people’s penises to fall off.The British have always been good at understatement. I once saw survivors being interviewed after a tornado had ripped the heart out of a small town in Oklahoma in the US.The Americans were hysterical, sobbing and saying: “The wind speed was, like, , miles an hour and I saw God himself reach down and take our house.”Whereas a British man, visiting on business, said when the cameras were poked in his face that it had been “a trle breezy”.That was charming, but whoever develops a vaccine will bring billions into the country, so we don’t want charm. We want our scientists to develop an American gung-ho, up-and-at-’em attitude.They can start by dropping this “encouraging” nonsense and describing their results as “awesome”.This seemed odd, because fitting windows to a submarine is as daft as fitting a coffee machine to a duck.I therefore did some checking and it turns out they’re there so that when the sub is on the surface, the crew don’t have to go outside to see where they are going. Which means they won’t get cold.Diddums. And we thought these guys were tough.I’VE often wonderedit’s ­possible to put something into Google search engine and get no results at all.I’ve tried quite often with phrases like “Piers Morgan fans” or “Alicia Vikander ugly tree”.But I’ve never managed it.Well, this week I needed to attach a snow plough to the front of my tractor – don’t ask – and had no idea how it could be done.So I googled “Front linkage Lamborghini .R”.And there it was. “Your search did not match any ­documents”.WE learned this week that there’s been a  per cent surge in the sales of cassette tapes.Couple of points on that. First of all, why  The sound quality on a cassette is so bad that for many years I thought that the Bee Gees had done a song called Bald Headed Woman, that the Police had sung about Sue Lawley and that Desmond Dekker had been saying: “My ears are alight.”Point number two is: what happened to the massive collection of cassettes we all used to have in the Seventies They can’t all have ended up wrapped round single shoes on the motorway’s central reservation.That’ll give me something to do tonight, I guess.

It’s a call to action, a national effort that we need.“I’ve thought for a long time that keeping people healthy is the best way to keep them out of hospital. Covid has doubled down on that.“After your age and sex, the third biggest impact on whether you will dieyou catch Covid is obesity.“It’s the third-biggest impact on how hard it hits you.“So I’ve long believed the NHS isn’t just about fixing people when they’re ill.

I’m just so glad that I did, because it helped.”As part of the drive, the TV industry faces restrictions on showing junk food ads before pm and there are plans to constrain such promotions online.Supermarket buy-one-get-one-free deals also face new rules and calorie counts on restaurant and takeaway- chain menus will come into force.Mr Hancock, who is often tempted by his daughter’s lemon meringue pie, is adamant the whole country has to show discipline on losing weight just like it obeyed lockdown measures.He says: “There is a huge role for parents to look out for the health of their children. We want to support parents to do that.“You wouldn’t give your child a cigarette. Parents have a responsibility that they eat healthily too.”“Teachers have a big role to play as well in this national effort.

Firstly, Keir Starmer askedJohnson had a message for people whose relatives had suffered from coronavirus – and he replied that Starmer had “more briefs than Calvin Klein”. It’s not only hilarious, but I’m sure it comforted grieving relatives. Then he responded to Starmer’s questions about the delayed report on Russian interference with our elections, by saying Starmer had “more flip-flops than Bournemouth beach”. Another glorious joke and one that certainly puts all our minds at ease about Vladimir Putin. So here are some others he can try, about himself. If he’s asked how much protective equipment his government provided for medical staff during the pandemic, he can say “We gave them less protection than a chemist’s at the Vatican”. If he’s asked what happened to the track and tracing he promised would “lead the world”, he can say “It’s had more failed dates than the history of Tinder”. He can tell us “Dominic Cummings has more implausible stories than Hollyoaks” and “his eyesight needs more checks than a chess tournament”. He can say “I consumed more coke than Sheffield steelworks” and I have “more kids I’ve forgotten about than an amnesiac goat herder”. Everyone seems to agree he’s a great speaker, witty and able to communicate clearly in a language we all understand. For example, there was the inspiring speech he gave to the West Yorkshire Police that began: “Everyone’s learning the caution, you know the caution, you know what you have to say, you do not have to say anything. “Is that right  Anything you butyou fail to mention something, which you later, hang on, is that right ” What is so reassuring about a speech like that is we’re all thinking it, but he’s the only one capable of putting it into words. It’s also a measure of his kindness that when he speaks he also give us a free puzzle, in which we have to try to put the words into an order that makes an actual sentence. Sometimes he explains ideas with even more clarity by throwing in a chunk of Latin, and some think “that means he MUST be clever”. We should extend this to everyone. If someone working class says “I tell you what, right, here, listen, you know that wotnot, well ipso facto modus operandi I tell you that for nuffink”, we should all say “what a splendid educated fellow he must be”.

And the Health Secretary added that without them, the health service would die.Boris Johnson singled out the two nurses who tended him – when his own le hung in the balance as he was racked by Covid- – for their dedication, skill and overwhelmingkindness.The PM also rightly recognised that they were typical of the hundreds of thousands of others putting their own lives at risk to save others. Yet in the public sector pay round last week, Mr Hancock and Mr Johnson left nurses out. They have every right to feel hurt, undervalued – and bloody furious.  So much so that, as the Sunday Mirror reveals today, , of them are now considering quitting.  That would be both a tragedy and a disaster. It is true that nurses, along with other NHS workers, agreed a three-year pay deal which does not run out until next March. In normal times, they would have stuck to their side of the bargain and not expected a rise until then. But these are not normal times. These are the most extraordinary times the NHS has been through since its  foundation.  Hospital staff have performed superhuman feats to care for the sick and dying, and hundreds have died themselves doing it. We clapped for them because it was the only way under lockdown we could express our immense and heartfelt gratitude. Mr Johnson verbally patted them on the back. Now he has slapped them in the face. Just as the coronavirus has changed all our lives, it should also change how we reward those who have given their all. That means starting pay negotiations now to ensure a hefty rise is in wage packets by Christmas. This is not the most you can do for them, Mr Johnson. It is the least. Act of comfort  The argument in favour of a Child Burial Fund to help parents hold funerals for their most precious loved ones was unassailable. Labour’s Carolyn Harris made it time and again in the Commons. The Sunday Mirror campaigned alongside her. And behind the scenes so did most MPs, including Theresa May when she was PM. Only the stone-hearted scrooges in the Treasury stood in the way. A year ago the argument was finally won and the Treasury coughed up the cash.

Here, in his own words, he shares his story... Have you ever sat on the bus and seen someone making a strange noise  Perhaps you moved away, feeling uncomfortable. Well, that person was possibly someone like me. I have Tourette’s Syndrome . Which means sometimes I make weird noises and twitch. Sometimes this freaks people out. You might assume all people with Tourette’s shout out swear words. But actually coprolalia – as it’s known – affects only % of us. I like to swear as much as the next Yorkshireman, but I don’t do it uncontrollably as part of my Tourette’s. There are many misconceptions about this neurological condition. My tics began when I was seven. I would snf loudly or let out a kind of ‘whooping’ noise. With little awareness on the topic, my parents had no clue what it could be. It took a primary school teacher to gently suggest I might have Tourette’s after watching a documentary. My mum, Annette, did her research after that, and within a few weeks we travelled from our home in Bradford to London’s Great Ormond Street, where the hospital confirmed the diagnosis. There is no cure for Tourette’s, but treatment can help manage symptoms. I was put on medication to help calm the tics. It didn’t work, but it made me pile on the pounds. So now I had my weight as well as tics to feel self-conscious about. I had no real understanding of what was happening, but that year I wrote to Father Christmas begging him to make me ‘normal’. People often ask what the tics feel like. Sometimes they are conscious, sometimes they aren’t. For the ones that are, it’s like an urge to scratch a bad mosquito bite – the more you resist the itch, the bigger it becomes. But when you finally scratch, after a moment of relief, the sensation s.  A tic can be anything from a noise, twitch or cough, to rapid head movements, finger clicks, deep breaths and whistles. It gets worse when you’re stressed, sick, nervous or excited, and everyone’s dferent. In public, during a bad day, it’s often mortying. I remember one of the visits to London when I was eight. Feeling excited about the train, the tics were prominent. I let out some ‘whoops’ and a man in the carriage shouted, ‘Will someone please shut that child up!’ My mum was furious on my behalf, but I felt such shame. It’s for this reason so many kids with Tourette’s shut themselves away. I was bullied, with name calling including ‘spastic’, ‘retard’ and ‘abortion’. Kids can be a***holes, and sometimes the teachers were unwittingly as bad. I got sent out of class when my vocal tics were aggravated. Standing in the hallway felt like a punishment for something I couldn’t help. And there was the supply teacher who yelled, ‘What on earth is wrong with you, boy ’ in front of the whole class. Even when people tried to be kind, hurtful situations arose. When our neighbours held a birthday party for their son, I’d been allowed early access on the bouncy castle. But when the guests arrived I was told it was ‘just for adults’ now and sent home. The next few hours were spent in my bedroom, tears rolling, as I listened to kids bouncing with glee. They were embarrassed about the twitching kid who makes noises. I hated being dferent.  So many kids with TS are full of self-loathing. I feel it’s my duty to help educate the next generation. There needs to be more compassion and understanding, so children aren’t scared and so judged. And while this may seem like a sorrowful tale, it’s actually not. Thankfully, le slowly improved. At senior school, aged , I had asked the headmaster to announce in assembly I had TS and explain what it was. This actually helped kids and staff become more tolerant. I learned an important lesson in facing problems head-on. While I wasn’t popular, I did have some friends. I was around  when I realised that channelling my energy into my passions – writing, drama, entrepreneurial projects – saw my tics begin to slow down and even disappear in some cases. These became coping mechanisms, greatly reducing the urges to tic. Truth is, people with Tourette’s have a superpower that, when channelled into something they love, makes them unstoppable. Intertwine this with ious cognitive behavioural therapies , such as meditation and positive mental attitude techniques, and it sets us a world apart. At  I landed a place at Lancaster University, studying marketing management, which I loved. I also ‘came out’. I’d had crushes on boys since I was , so this was a massive relief.  I first became interested in wine when, during my course, I spent a year in San Francisco. I met an amazing couple who became like family to me, Steve and Rose Smith. I’d often shadow them on weekends at their winery, and their love for wine completely rubbed off on me – the senses, the smells, the tasting profiles. I was hooked, and it kick-started my career in the wine industry. I now write a wine and spirits column, and through this world met my incredible friends Helena Nicklin and Colin Hampden-White. Together, we created an award-winning TV series on Amazon Prime called The Three Drinkers. You might wonder how the hell a person with Tourette’s ended up as a TV presenter  Interestingly, when the cameras roll, I’m so focused on doing what I love, my tics go away and viewers have no idea. Tourette’s doesn’t just ‘disappear’, of course. It’s with us forever, although statistically it calms down with age. Confidence issues can greatly affect people with TS. Take dating. ‘Will anyone ever fall in love with me ’ is a concern that worries many of us. On a first date my tics can go unnoticed, some of us learn to mask them. But by the time someone comes over for dinner they get more obvious. People ask, ‘Have you got hiccups ’ and you have to work out when best to tell them. I don’t exactly want to pull out the TS leaflets over the second bottle of wine. I’m still navigating this. My le will never be ‘normal’, and I’ll continue getting odd looks. But I’m happy and successful. These days I see having Tourette’s not as my weakness, but my biggest strength.  Touretteaposs – the facts WHAT IS TOURETTE’S  A neurological condition characterised by repetitive, stereotyped, involuntary movements and vocalisations called tics.

Ready  I’m not talking about ­storing pigs in blankets, Xmas puds and ­stuffing balls in the freezers we all bought for lockdown. And we certainly don’t want to see another heartbreaking run on Brussells sprouts like the one in  due, farmers reported, to a wet windy summer. No, it’s not our yuletide spread that’s under threat this year. It’s whether we’ll be well enough to eat it. “Winter preparedness” is the new Downing Street buzzphrase. It may sound like a chapter from an old-fashioned home economics book that Fanny Cradock wrote in the s, but it’s actually a ­matter of le and death. Winter preparedness could be every bit as vital as pandemic preparedness should have been way back in February and March. That’s when government ­leaders and health officials knew something dangerous was on the horizon but failed to have a plan and faffed about for too long, blithely telling us they were “following the science”. In ordinary winters we know the old and vulnerable ­succumb to seasonal flu. Thousands die even in a good year when flu vaccine targets the right virus. But winter preparedness in a Covid- year is going to take on a whole new ­urgency. Scientists fear there’s going to be a second wave of the deadly pandemic and we are really going to need those Nightingale Hospitals – at a time when the NHS is traditionally under stress. So as part of a series of measures to help the NHS cope with a second wave, it’s been announced that  million extra people will be offered a free flu jab.  Anyone over , anyone ­shielding and children up to the first year of secondary school will be part of the UK’s ­biggest-ever vaccination programme. But anyone who listens to the experts knows there are three stages to the efficacy of vaccines. One is RD – actually formulating the vaccine in the first place. Two is manufacturing enough of it fast. And three is distributing it evenly, quickly and fairly.

Lara Crabb gleefully showed herself defying advice from scientists hoping to avoid Covid- spreading. Crabb is among defiant Brits refusing to follow rules designed to stop the spread of Covid- and save lives. Yesterday new rules came in making it compulsory to wear a face covering in shops, with those refusing to do so facing fines of up to £.Crabb, who has also shared a link to anti-lockdown campaign group Keep Britain Free, wrote on Twitter : Didnapost clap for the NHS once.They are paid to do their job. Havenapost clapped for a Sky Sports cameraman woman either but would prefer to clap for one of them. The shopper, who described herself as anti vaccines shared a video of herself shopping with no mask on. Crabb said she has endured abuse since voicing her opposition to wearing face coverings. Another Brit, tattoo artist Aron Walton, filmed himself walking around a Sainsburyaposs story claiming that face coverings were ineffective. Some companies have called on customers to wear face coverings but said they will not actively enforce the new rules. But John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, called for them to rethink this, saying: I would urge retail outlets to play their part in making the rules crystal clear -you are not wearing a face covering then you are not coming in. Officers will be there to help storesneeded - but only as a last resort, as we simply do not have the resources.  He continued: If youaposre out shopping and you see somebody not wearing a face covering it may be because they have a hidden disability. Donapost jump to conclusions, donapost have a go at them. This is new for us all, itaposs about keeping each other safe. Please be nice!

He warned that the lockdown has and will lead to devastating economic impact.  The number of shoppers in England declined by .% yesterday compared to the previous Friday, following a week of relatively steady increases in traffic to stores and supermarkets.

Rebecca Barnes said a brush with giant hogweedaposs poisonous sap left her two kids needing hospital treatment. Son Reggie, seven, and daughter Roma, five, were rushed to Salisbury District Hospital for urgent treatment after touching the plant while playing. If it had gone in their eyes, they would have been blinded for le. A River Trust expert warned It is, without a shadow of a doubt, the most dangerous plant in Britain. Giant hogweed can tower at ft tall like a Trfid, and children are attracted to it because the hollow stems of the plant make ideal peashooters. It produces a toxic sap which reacts with sunlight and burns the skin, causing permanent blisters and scars. It can also even lead to permanent blindness. Rebecca said initially Roma had aposmildapos redness and rash-like symptoms, but after a long day in the sun things got worse. As the day wore on the blisters got bigger and bigger and bigger. The sap removes the natural UV protection of the skin, so what Roma was actually suffering was burns from the sun. Romaaposs parents say the public should be made more aware. Rebecca said Itaposs not commonly warned about which I think it needs to be. On public footpaths there needs to be pictures of it becausethe sap gets into your eyes it can cause permanent blindness.  Roma, who was the worst affected, will need bandages on her arms and legs for a y time. For at least six months, but up to seven years sun protection wonapost be enough. Iaposm just praying that the scarring isnapost left because it can obviously leave really bad scars. One expert, Guy Barter, from the Royal Horticultural Society, said giant hogweedaposs risks are greater this year because the plant is flourishing.  It likes damp soil, it likes riparian areas next to rivers and of course this winter we had an awful lot of rain - one of the wettest winters on record. Rivers were high, that picked up the seeds and fragments of plants and spread them out along water courses. It grows like a Trfid and can tower ft tall. It was innocently shipped into the UK by well-meaning Victorian plant hunters in the th century. Spitting out poisonous sap when touched, it has escaped from country mansion gardens and private collections and is spreading across the countryside.  A map published by Plant Trackers shows it now exists in most parts of the country and its progress seems unstoppable. In Gloucestershire itaposs already been seen sprouting this spring in rural areas including Painswick and Stonehouse. Other aposTrfidsapos have been sighted near Ross-on-Wye on the Herefordshire border and the woods around Ullenwood. Now labelled public enemy number one in the countryside, itaposs a special threat to children. Its stems are hollow, so they try to use the apostubesapos as pretend telescopes or peashooters. There have been several cases in the past of youngsters screaming in pain from the agonising blisters which appear on their skin.  Parents are being warned to tell their children not to touch the plant whose leaves, stems, roots, flowers and seeds all contain the poisonous toxin. In the summer of  horticulturist Dean Simmons was left with le-changing injuries after brushing against one of the plants growing in Taunton, Somerset. Its tentacle-like fronds touched his bare legs and he suffered agonising skin burns that doctors say would take months to heal. Speaking at the time he said I feel so stupid - because of my job, I had knowledge of this plant and was still caught out. I was out fishing and didnapost see it until it was too late - and a day later I was on morphine. The plant, which kills off rival native plants by growing so fast and big that it blots out their sunlight, loves to lurk along rivers and canals to aposambushapos families out for a walk. Dean said in  The burns and pain are pure agony and I canapost walk. I would hate to see a child in my position. The pain is unreal.  In September , Keith Cooper, , was hospitalised by the plantaposs toxic sap after he went to look at a ‘pretty plant’ that his we Maria had seen in the undergrowth. Keith, of Howdon, Tyne and Wear, did not realise they had stumbled across some giant hogweed and doctors warned he would not be able to expose his badly-burnt right leg to sunlight until the year .

According to Finding Freedom, the couple were dismayed when no picture of them and their son Archie was visible on the desk in the Green Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace, where the Queen records her annual speech. In , Harry and Meghan appeared in a photo with William and Kate as the Queen read her Christmas message. Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand write that Harry and Meghan felt they had long been sidelined by the institution and were not a fundamental part of its future. The absence of their photo was yet another sign that they needed to consider their own path, the book says. According to palace sources quoted in the book, the Royal Family wanted to illustrate the line of succession. Harry and Meghan were not completely disregarded in the Christmas Day speech, however. Footage of the Queen and Prince Philip meeting Archie for the first time was included, with footage showing Harry, Meghan and Meghan’s mum, Doria Ragland, watching on. I have been delighted to welcome our eighth great-grandchild, the Queen said at the time.

Thereaposs also a photograph of King George VI from  as well as one of the Duke of Edinburgh from the Queenaposs private collection. But notably, Harry, Meghan and their son Archie are no where to be seen. Royal commentator Ingrid Seward said at the time it was unlikely the Queen’s photo selections represented a deliberate snub to Harry and Meghan. But she said: “It does seem to represent the idea of a slimmed-down monarchy.” Ms Seward added: “All the media problems with Harry and Meghan must have worried her. However, she would never be so underhand as to deliberately omit their picture.” Prince Andrew, forced to quit royal duties over his aposcar crashapos Newsnight interview over his ­friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, was also absent from the photos.As the Queenaposs Christmas Day speech was aired to millions across the world, Meghan and Harry were spending the Christmas break in Canada with their young son."},{"url":null,"title":"huge dog left gutted new","story":"NewsHuge dog left gutted with her new paddling pool after owners hilarious mistakeCha Sparks was left in hysterics when the dog pool her stepdad had ordered on Facebook turned up at the house for her huge Newfoundland Darcy to use during the summerShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  JUL NewsDarcy was excited to be getting a pool of her own \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Weekly #TeamDogSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Six weeks later, Cha was left baffled when a tiny parcel arrived at her front door in Shorne, Kent, and had no idea what it could be - until she realised the hilarious mistake. It turns out the dog pool ordered online was no bigger than a water bowl and looked comical next to Darcy, who could wear her new toy as a hat. Lawyer Cha said: Darcy absolutely loves water.

Despite feeling a little ripped off, the pair found it hysterical and posted photos of a gutted Darcy towering over her new pool on social media, where it quickly went viral. Cha added: We think it may have been a scam, however we were so entertained we didnapost give it much thought.  My stepdad isnapost very technical so he didnapost realise. He hasnapost contacted the company yet, I am going to help him with this in the coming days. We sent photos to our friends, who all thought it was comical. That is when I decided to post it online to a dog group, as I knew they would find it funny too.

Shortly after noticing two men were following her, two women approached and tried to grab her three-year-old daughter by the hand, StokeonTrent Live reports. The women tried to walk off with the young girl but Athena managed to snatch her daughter back. The two women ran off, as did the two men. Athena has reported the incident, which happened around .pm on Wednesday, July , to police.  Urging parents to be vigilant, Athena said on Facebook : This is a warning to parents to be careful and watch their smaller children like an eagle while shopping in Stafford.I had one little one in the pram and a three-year-old holding the side of the pram whilst out in town. I walked to the market in the Guildhall. I turned my head to look in a shop window when two foreign men walked off in front after following us around. Then two foreign ladies were speeding walking past grabbed the childaposs arm and tried walking off with her. Luckily I grabbed her other arm and the two women ran off to the men before we could say anything. I was going out the double doors in Guildhall out towards Cash Converters at the time. My daughter was shook up a little bit but I don’t think she really knew what was going on as we were looking at the toys in the window so she was more interested in that.  Several parents were shocked to learn about the attempted kidnap. Commenting on the Facebook post, one said: This is every parents worst nightmare. The whole town is covered in CCTV so hopefully it will have picked the up. Another added: It just makes me feel sick. How could someone  take someoneaposs daughter or son away from their own mother  Itaposs beyond a joke. Iaposm just trying to keep my daughter safe and sound. One of the men is described as being ft with dark hair and was wearing black trousers and a red jumper and yellow collared shirt.

The Earl of Snowdon, widely known by his professional name David Linley, was in the paedophile’s list of contacts. Others included some of the world’s most powerful people, including Donald Trump and former US president Bill Clinton. Florida-based Spencer Kuvin, representing several Epstein victims, urged the royal to speak to investigators, alongside his cousin Prince Andrew. There is no suggestion the Earl is accused of any wrongdoing or has any information about Prince Andrew’s friendship with Epstein, who died in jail in , or his socialite pal Ghislaine Maxwell.But Mr Kuvin told the Sunday People: “Anyone with information about Epstein, Maxwell and any of their comings and goings over the past two decades and more should come forward and talk, including Viscount Linley. He added: “I am never surprised at the growing list of people that became Epstein’s unfortunate friends. He worked his way into every part of society, high and low.”  The Earl is known as the royal carpenter due to his high-end furniture business Linley’s. His mother Margaret, the Queen’s sister, died in  and he became the nd Earl of Snowdon after his father died in . The Earl, now set to orce after more than  years of marriage, was picked by his first cousin Prince Charles as No in The Prince’s Foundation. The appointment in  raised eyebrows as he was chosen ahead of William and Harry. A friend said: “David is very, very close to the Queen and Prince Charles. He goes to Sandringham at Christmas and Balmoral in the summer. He is George VI’s grandson and in the inner circle of royals. He is also Mr Non-Grand Royal. He turns up on his cycle in a high-vis jacket and gets mistaken for a warden. He is popular and social.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton rolled out red","story":"NewsKate Middleton rolled out the red carpet for Meghan as friends hit out at bookFriends of the Duchess of Cambridge have struck back at fresh claims in new biography Finding Freedom, that say the royal was unwelcoming towards MeghanShareCommentsByLila Randall:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsMeghan and Kate at Wimbledon last year \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

At the very least, the co-authors, Carolyn Durand and Omid Scobie, who has been accused of being Meghanaposs mouthpiece, had access to close friends of the Sussexes. The book defends Meghan and Harry and reveals what was behind their decision to quit their roles as senior royals and pursue their own projects in private le. It describes a culture of increasing tension between the couple and other senior royals. Meghan, Harry and one-year-old son Archie are now living in pal Tyler Perryaposs £ million Tuscan-style mansion in Los Angeles after breaking out on their own. Here are some of the bombshell claims revealed in the second extracts of the book. Williams two words about Meghan aposthat caused rt with Harryapos William feared his brother had been blindsided by lust in his haste to wed Meghan - and used two words in particular that angered Harry, the book claims. The co-authors claim the Duke of Sussex was angered by what he perceived as his brotheraposs snobbish attitude to his bride. Harry was offended by Williamaposs unwanted advice to take as much time as you need to get to know this girl, it is alleged. According to the book, William was happy for his brother, but just wanted to make sure that Harry wasnapost blindsided by lust. But his younger brother allegedly took offence to the phrase this girl, and interpreted it as snobbish and condescending. aposRt stemmed from coolness between princesapos  According to the co-authors, the alleged rt between the two couples stemmed from a growing coolness between Harry and William - and not Meghan and Kate. The press were apparently too quick to blame the Sussexesapos decision to move to Windsor on the duelling duchesses, the authors say, when it was Harry who felt suffocated by his brother. Meghan and Kate aposwere not at warapos As it became clear there were problems between the Cambridges and Sussexes, some press reports claimed Meghan and Kate were at odds or even disliked each other. But the biography claims the pair were not at war, but did have their awkward moments and never became close because they had nothing in common. It alleges the Duchess of Cambridge apparently did little to bridge the ide between William and Harry, and never really got to know Meghan. The authors claim Meghan and Kate didnapost spend much time together before the Sussexes got married in May  and they didnapost get any closer afterwards. aposAwkward momentsapos between duchesses  There were some awkward moments between the royal wives, but the duo never had a falling out. It is claimed Meghan had hoped Kate would reach out to her, but didnapost lose sleep over it when she did not. The book says: Meghan would agree with the assessment that the duchesses were not the best of friends. Their relationship hadnapost progressed much since she was Harryaposs girlfriend. But they were not at war with each other, either. There were awkward moments, such as the day the women happened to cross paths at Kensington Palace , and although both were heading out to go shopping - in the same street - Kate went in her own Range Rover. Meghan didnapost make Kate cry, book claims Rumours that Meghan made Kate cry during a bridesmaidaposs dress fitting for Princess Charlotte are , the book insists. Reports that Meghanaposs strict demands had left Kate in tears puzzled those who were present. A source who was there claimed: Some of the children werenapost co-operating, and there was a lot going on. Everyone tried to help where they could, but itaposs never easy with kids at fittings. There were no tears from anyone. And in the end, the fitting was fine. Kate and Meghan were both a little stressed but professional in the room, and there were other people there. Harryaposs aposshowgirlapos  Finding Freedom claims some senior royals, courtiers and aides had ious names for Meghan behind her back. One senior royal allegedly referred to the duchess as Harryaposs showgirl - and another said she comes with a lot of baggage. Another senior courtier is said to have told a colleague: Thereaposs just something about her I donapost trust. Sussexes aposfelt snubbedapos by Queen Harry and Meghan are said to have felt snubbed when the Queen delivered her Christmas Day speech last year and they didnapost see photos of their family next to her. The absence of their photo was yet another sign that they needed to consider their own path, the book says. However, the Queen mentioned Archieaposs birth in her speech and the broadcast showed footage of her and Prince Philip meeting their eighth great-grandchild for the first time. Meghan felt sorry for her dad - and then let down The Duchess of Sussex felt sorry for her estranged father Thomas, wanted him at her wedding and blamed the media for corrupting him, according to the book. She felt let down when Mr Markle lied to her by denying he helped the paparazzi stage photos of him going about his le in a Mexican resort town before his daughteraposs wedding. But both Meghan and Harry were also angry at the media for allegedly wearing down Mr Markle for several months until he complied with their requests. According to an unnamed trusted confidant of the duchess, Meghan had said: My dad never sought this out. I really believe that heaposs the victim, and now I feel sad because I believe heaposs been fully corrupted. Meghanaposs dad and half-sister apossplit cash from staged photosapos The book says after a newspaper revealed the location of his home in November, , Mr Markle rejected constant media requests with a line prepared for him by royal officials of: I canapost speak out of respect for my family. Meghan and Harry told him to do his best to ignore the press, but ultimately - with encouragement from Meghanaposs elder half-sister Samantha - Mr Markle accepted a proposal from photographer Jeff Rayner, the book says. Mr Markle agreed to participate in several set-up photos, including one of him reading a book on British history while at a cafe. The photos were published around the world, with Mr Rayner earning £,, and Mr Markle and daughter Samantha sharing % of the proceeds, according to the book. A week before the May  royal wedding, Kensington Palace officials heard a Sunday tabloid was planning to expose the photo-shoot as having been staged. Meghan called dad to find out truth  The book says palace communications staff and lawyers were moving to have publication stopped, as Meghan phoned her father. Dad, we need to knowthis is true or not, because my team is going to try and stop this story from running -you are telling me itaposs fake, she reportedly told him. If they do that, theyaposre going out of their way to protect you, Dad. Youaposre telling me youaposre being victimised, right  Mr Markle had replied Of course, failing to admit he had participated in the staging of the photos, which were duly exposed as set-ups in the press the next day. Duchess still wanted her dad at wedding Despite his deception, Meghan had still wanted her father at her wedding. He ultimately did not attend, partly due to suffering a heart attack days before the event, which he blamed on the stresses of pressure from the media. As much as she was hurt and humiliated, she wanted him to be there and was willing to move on, an unidentied friend of Meghanaposs is quoted as saying. Plus, she was worried about him she honestly wasnapost surehe was actually OK. His behaviour was bizarre. Thomas ignored Meghanaposs last text before wedding  The book gives further glimpses of Meghanaposs troubled relationship with Mr Markle, including a string of uned phone messages and texts from the former actress to her father in the days before her wedding. She allegedly left or sent dozens of messages telling him a car would take him to Los Angeles airport so he could fly to London. He was expected to walk her down the aisle. After he had told her he wouldnapost be there to watch her get married, the biography claims, a heartbroken Meghan sent her dad one final text message the night before her wedding. However, he didnapost respond. The book claims: “If it wasn’t for Harry, Doria and her friends, Meghan herself says that she wouldn’t have mentally got through it [the wedding]. “The night before the wedding, she sent her father one last text. He did not reply,” the book says. “Sitting in a bath later that night, FaceTiming with a friend, the bride-to-be said she had left her dad a final message, adding: ‘I can’t sit up all night just pressing send’.” The beginning of the rt "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan  harry book six","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Harry book has  revelations to rock monarchy - with more to comeFrom feuding wives to upsetting the Queen, Finding Freedom is packed full of shocking secrets Kensington Palace would probably prefer to keep under wraps...ShareCommentsByPatrick HillRussell MyersAmy Sharpe:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsNew book Finding Freedom lts the lid on the drama at Kensington Palace and why Prince Harry and Meghan Markle decided to quit Royal le \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

In the book, which is being serialised by the Times and the Sunday Times, the authors claim the Duke of Sussex was angered by what he perceived as his brotheraposs snobbish attitude to his bride. Other claims include that yhe two couples hardly spoke at the Commonwealth service at Westminster Abbey in March, despite not having seen each other since January. While the Sussexes felt their complaints were not taken seriously and believed other royal households were leaking stories about them to the press. Here we reveal the six most bombshell claims that will rock the Royal Family to its core. William  Harry’s fallout Prrince Harry was fed up of playing second fiddle to William and Kate – and felt the pair were given better roles than him and Meghan, the book claims. But a source close to the royals said Prince Charles included both Wills and Harry in his plans for a “slimmed-down monarchy”. They said: “His vision included both his sons. William will always be more important than Harry but that’s a fact only because of birthright.” The book also says William was not impressed when he first heard Harry was stepping down but left it to aides to sort the details. William reportedly told a friend: “I’ve put my arm around my brother all our lives and I can’t do that anymore. We’re separate entities.” Race and the Royal Family Joining the royals was tough for Meghan as a mixed-race American, it is alleged. Author Omid Scobie hints at racist attitudes within the household, saying of Meghan arriving on the scene: “That was going to ruffle feathers.” The book does not accuse the royals of racism, but Mr Scobie told The Times: “There are iniduals who may like to take a look at how they view the world.” Harry and Meghan have been outspoken on the subject of racial injustice, addressing the topic a number of times since George Floyd died during a police arrest in the US in May. This month they called on the UK to confront its colonial past during a video conference with young black leaders from across the British Commonwealth. Harry told them: “There is no way that we can move forward unless we acknowledge the past.” Kate  Meghan’s relationship  The Duchesses’ relation-ship never moved past “distant politeness” – and had turned distinctly frosty by this year, the book claims. The strain between Kate and Meghan was evident at the King Power Royal Charity Polo Day last year. “While the doting mothers were photographed next to each other with their children, the two appeared to barely exchange a word,” write the authors. Tensions peaked at their final joint engagement, the Commonwealth service at Westminster, in March. It’s claimed: “although Meghan tried to make eye contact with Kate, the duchess barely acknowledged her”. Harry  Meghan ‘finding freedom’  Harry had long struggled with royal le but wanted to find a “happy place” within the monarchy, the book claims. “It wasn’t just the press or online trolls getting to Harry,” it says. “It was also the institution of the monarchy. “Barely a week went by without internal affairs or matters of private discussions being twisted and leaked.” They wanted to continue due to Harry’s “love and respect for his grandmother,” it adds, but also because Meghan felt she had given up so much “to take her le down a path of service to the monarchy.”  But the couple allegedly felt “blocked” after requesting a meeting with the Queen during a UK visit on January – and it being pushed back to the th.The authors add: “Harry felt he and Meghan had long been sidelined by the institution and were not a fundamental part of its future.” Royal courtiersapos rage    Senior royal staff feared that Harry and Meghan’s fame would “eclipse that of the Royal Family”, the book claims. Courtiers – described by Princess Diana, below, as “men in grey suits” – reportedly felt the Sussexes must be “reigned in”. The authors write: “As their popularity had grown, so did Harry and Meghan’s dficulty in understanding why so few inside the palace were looking out for their interests. They were a major draw for the Royal Family.” A friend of the pair referred to the old guard as “vipers”.

The authors write: “Courtiers viewed Harry’s position as completely unrealistic.” The Queen left ‘blindsided’    The couple’s announcement detailing their departure and launch of their Sussex Royal website left the Queen “devastated”, Finding Freedom says. An insider said: “The element of surprise, the blindsiding of the Queen, for the other principals who are all mindful of this, rightfully, it was deeply upsetting.” It had been agreed the couple and Her Majesty would release a joint statement announcing the decision, but Harry and Meghan broke ranks on January  after their plans were leaked to the media.

Another royal said “she comes with a lot of baggage”.And Harry was further angered by brother William referring to Meg as “this girl”. The revelations, in new book Finding Freedom, came as royal biographer Andrew Morton said Princess Diana would have been “devastated” by the rt between her beloved sons. According to the revelations – on Sky TV ahead of publication in the Sunday Times – sources revealed William had given advice to Harry about his relationship with Meghan. William reportedly said: “Don’t feel you need to rush this. Take as much time as you need to get to know this girl.” Harry, , was said to have felt the comments came with a “tone of snobbishness” that was “anathema to his approach to the world”. The book says Meghan was a topic of Palace gossip when she first dated Harry in .One extract says: “One senior royal referred to the American actress as ‘Harry’s showgirl’. Another told an aide, ‘She comes with a lot of baggage’. And a high-ranking courtier was overheard telling a colleague, ‘There’s just something about her I don’t trust’.” The book also refers to Meghan’s relationship with William’s we Kate. It says there were some “awkward moments” but the pair never had a falling out.It says: “Meghan would agree the duchesses were not the best of friends. Their relationship hadn’t progressed much since she was Harry’s girlfriend. But they were not at war. The bookaposs co-authors, Carolyn Durand and Omid Scobie, claim Harry was offended by Williamaposs advice, but according to the pair, William was happy for his brother, but just wanted to make sure that Harry wasnapost blindsided by lust.  Harryaposs belief that the palace was out to sabotage his relationship was the beginning of the rt with his brother. He is said to have felt unprotected by the institutions around the monarchy, and derided by the old guard for being too sensitive and outspoken. The Duchess of Cambridge apparently did little to bridge the ide and never really got to know Meghan. One source said of Harry: Heaposs extremely protective of Meghan. He understands that a lot of people are against them, and he will do everything he can to keep her safe and away from getting hurt - eventhat means distancing himself from those people.  Another said the coolness between the princes was the reason for Harry and Meghanaposs move to Windsor. He wanted to get away from the goldfish bowl that was Kensington Palace, the said. Everywhere you turn, youaposre surrounded by staff and family. He was at a point in his le where he was working with his brother, doing the foundation with his brother and living by his brother. It was too much.  Other claims include that - The two couples hardly spoke at the Commonwealth service at Westminster Abbey in March, despite not having seen each other since January. - The Sussexes felt their complaints were not taken seriously and believed other royal households were leaking stories about them to the press. - Being told to operate under Buckingham Palaceaposs umbrella after splitting their household from the Cambridges was a big disappointment to the Sussexes.

The authors of Finding Freedom, serialised by The Times and The Sunday Times, claim Meghan had hoped Kate would reach out to her, but didnapost lose sleep over it when she did not. As well as a number of salacious revelations about the Sussexesapos growing bitterness towards the royal family and the machinery of the monarchy, the book also tries to debunk a few alleged myths. According to the co-authors, Carolyn Durand and Omid Scobie, the alleged rt between the two couples stemmed from a growing coolness between Harry and William - and not Meghan and Kate. The press were apparently too quick to blame the Sussexesapos decision to move to Windsor on the duelling duchesses, the authors say, when it was Harry who felt suffocated by his brother. The authors wrote: The truth was that Meghan and Kate just didnapost know each other that well. They claim the duchessesapos relationship had not really progressed from when they had first met, and that Meghan was disappointed by Kateaposs lack of support during her roughest times with the press. But rumours that Meghan made Kate cry during a bridesmaidaposs dress fitting for Princess Charlotte are , the book insists. Reports that Meghanaposs strict demands had left Kate in tears puzzled those who were present.  A source who was there said: Some of the children werenapost co-operating, and there was a lot going on. Everyone tried to help where they could, but itaposs never easy with kids at fittings. There were no tears from anyone. And in the end, the fitting was fine. Kate and Meghan were both a little stressed but professional in the room, and there were other people there.

Believed to have been tacitly approved by the couple, it includes revelations about the breakdown of Harry’s relationship with brother William and fallouts between Meghan and Kate. And it claims the pair felt “used for their popularity” by courtiers and “sidelined” by senior royals. The bombshell biography also suggests Harry felt as though he Meghan, , were left “unprotected, alone and disparaged” back within the institution’s walls for being too sensitive and outspoken. It even claims the -year-old Prince “had lost respect for certain family members at points” and that he likened a week of January meetings with senior royals and palace aides “to standing in front of a firing squad” as he tried to negotiate a step-down deal. The US authors of Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family say the book was written with the “participation of those closest to Meghan and Harry”, including “inner circle” members Harry and Meghan yesterday claimed they did not contribute to the biography. Their spokesperson said the book was based on “independent reporting” by writers Omid Scobie, royal editor at society magazine Harper’s Bazaar US and journalist Carolyn Durand who spent two decades covering the Royal Family in London. A palace source told us: “The book will probably be a bestseller and make a load of money for the authors – but then what  Harry and Meghan’s reputation will be completely scarred. “It’s hard to be a trailblazeryou’re setting fire to everything around you. It’s asthey are burning bridges with the family.” The biography claims Meghan, , tearfully told a pal earlier this year: “I gave up my entire le for this family, willing to do whatever it takes. But here we are.” Scobie and Durand also describe Harry as “emotional” after being stripped of honorary military appointments.The Prince is also is said to have had “grown frustrated” with some of the “old guard” of Palace staff and the “back seat” they had to take to other family members. The authors wrote: “There were just a handful at the palace they could trust. A friend of the couple referred to the old guard as ‘vipers’. The couple are said to have been left “disappointed” at not being allowed to form their own household team at Frogmore after their  marriage.And the book adds Harry was angered by suggestions Meghan was solely responsible for their decision to quit. An insider told the authors: “The courtiers blame Meghan, and some family do”.But a source close to the couple claimed Harry had always wished to embark on his own path, saying : “Fundamentally, Harry wanted out. Deep down, he was always struggling within that world. She’s opened  the door for him.” The authors also claim Harry believed he had been “blocked” from seeing the Queen after the couple’s decision to step down from royal le.Yet as “devastated” as she was at her grandson leaving formal royal le, Her Majesty is said to have “made it very clear they can come back whenever they want”. The book claims Harry even considered breaking protocol by making an unannounced visit to Sandringham to “plead their case”.He is said to have felt courtiers – described by his late mother as the “men in grey suits” – were intent on “reining in” the couple’s popularity amid fears the public’s affection for them “might eclipse that of the Royal Family itself”.  Our Palace source said: “Many feel the accusations unjust. “Everyone bent over backwards to make sure Harry and Meghan had everything they ever wanted. Time and time again they were offered advice and didn’t take a blind bit of notice.” The source also admitted courtiers are anxious about more revelations ahead of the book’s worldwide publication on August .They have compared it to Andrew Morton’s book about Princess Diana, which he wrote with her help. Extracts in today’s Times also tell how Harry emailed the Queen and Prince Charles to say he and Meghan “had come to the decision to change the way they worked — to step back and spend more time abroad”.The authors claim Harry made repeated requests to his father’s private office to nail down a time in January for the two to meet the Queen then at Sandringham for the Christmas holiday. But the astonished Prince was allegedly told she would not be available until January , leaving him feeling “he was being blocked”. A source in the book adds: “At this point they felt like they had brought up the subject enough times with family members over the past year and they were fed up of not being taken seriously.”Hitting back at the claims, a separate Palace source told us: “One thing which won’t be made clear is how Harry and Meghan were happy to use all the power and privilege at their disposal while secretly planning to leave.“It’s now clear they were using Meghan’s connections in America to set up their new le way beforehand.” Meghan and Harry, who had son Archie in May last year, broke with royal tradition to spend last Christmas in Canada instead of Sandringham."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle says dad has","story":"NewsMeghan Markle says her dad has been fully corrupted but wanted him at her weddingA new biography about Meghan and Prince Harry says the Duchess felt sorry for her estranged father but she blames the media for what happened between themShareCommentsByTrevor Marshallsea:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsMeghan Markle and her dad Thomas in happier times \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Meghan felt let down when Thomas Markle lied to her by denying he helped the paparazzi stage photos of him going about his le in a Mexican resort town before the royal wedding, the book Finding Freedom alleges. But both Meghan and Harry were also angry at the media for wearing down Mr Markle for several months until he complied with their requests. In a new excerpt published by the Sunday Times, authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand write that, according to an unnamed trusted confidant of the duchess, Meghan had said: My dad never sought this out. I really believe that heaposs the victim, and now I feel sad because I believe heaposs been fully corrupted. The book says after a newspaper revealed the location of his home in November, , Mr Markle rejected constant media requests with a line prepared for him by royal officials of: I canapost speak out of respect for my family. Meghan and Harry told him to do his best to ignore the press, but ultimately - with encouragement from Meghanaposs elder half-sister Samantha - Mr Markle accepted a proposal from photographer Jeff Rayner, the book says. Mr Markle agreed to participate in several set-up photos, including one of him reading a book on British history while at a cafe. The photos were published around the world, with Mr Rayner earning £,, and Mr Markle and daughter Samantha sharing % of the proceeds, according to the book which has been serialised this weekend in The Times and The Sunday Times.  A week before the May  royal wedding, Kensington Palace officials heard a Sunday tabloid was planning to expose the photo-shoot as having been staged. The book says palace communications staff and lawyers were moving to have publication stopped, as Meghan phoned her father. Dad, we need to knowthis is true or not, because my team is going to try and stop this story from running -you are telling me itaposs fake, she reportedly told him. If they do that, theyaposre going out of their way to protect you, Dad. Youaposre telling me youaposre being victimised, right  Mr Markle had replied Of course, failing to admit he had participated in the staging of the photos, which were duly exposed as set-ups in the press the next day. Despite his deception, Meghan had still wanted her father at her wedding. He ultimately did not attend, partly due to suffering a heart attack days before the event, which he blamed on the stresses of pressure from the media.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex sensationally quit the royal family earlier this year. But there were warnings signs of their shock move and the Queen knew something was amiss before Christmas, according to a report this evening.The revelations come on the eve of a bombshell biography of the couple called aposFinding Freedomapos which is set to be serialized this weekend. A new report claims that in November  Her Majesty had not heard whether the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their newborn son Archie would be spending Christmas at Sandringham and she decided to give them a call at Frogmore Cottage.The decision broke with tradition as ordinarily it is for the younger Royals to phone “Granny”.But the -year-old wanted to get to the bottom of what was happening after hearing tales of apostantrumsapos ever since the couple got married at Windsor Castle in , reports The .  However, the Queen did not get the answer she wanted and instead days later she learnt the couple were not coming for Christmas but on a six-week sabbatical to Canada to “work out their future”.It was during this time they reportedly plotted their way out of the Royal Family and within weeks, on January , it was announced that Harry and Meghan would be taking a new direction as royals. While their decision had been made, Harry reportedly wanted to speak with The Queen and Prince Charles - his grandmother and father - on the phone but officials persudaded him instead to write to them.  Extracts from new biography Finding Freedom, by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, are expected to reveal - Harry’s anger predominantly lay with what his mother famously described as the palace’s “men in grey suits” - rather than his own royal relatives. A source said: The palace approach would always be - how did we do it last time  He wanted to do things dferently and I think Meghan was the catalyst for him but also gave him the confidence which he lacked to change things.” "},{"url":null,"title":"nominate lockdown legend national lottery","story":"AdvertorialNominate a lockdown legend for a National Lottery Award - and they could earn £, for their charityIf you know an ordinary person who has done extraordinary things during the COVID- pandemic, heres your chance to get them the recognition they deserveShareByRichard Innes:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL AdvertorialRachel Riley is one of the famous faces supporting the  National Lottery Awards \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Rachel Riley is one of the famous faces backing the awards, which will for the first time recognise the amazing work of iniduals from National Lottery-funded projects across the nation.  Rachel says: “Thanks to National Lot­­tery players, some £million has gone to support communities in the crisis. “But this year we want to honour the people within those projects who adapted so quickly and gave extra help. “It’s a real chance to say thank you. The winners in each category will win £, for their organisation and a National Lottery Award trophy.” Nominations are open- and the stories of some of the heroes already put forward showcase the commitment and sacrice so many people have been making during these troubled times.  Take actress and theatre director Moji Elufowoju, the founder of Sheffield-based Utopia Theatre Company. She has just been nominated for a National Lottery Award, thanks to the incredible Creative Hub initiative she has been running during lockdown. Now , Moji swapped a career as a paralegal to study drama in her forties before founding Utopia Theatre in . And as a British-born, Nigerian-raised performer, Moji says she had to battle discrimination in an industry where ethnic minorities have struggled for opportunities. She broke through after “continually banging my head against a brick wall and refusing to take no for an answer”. She is now determined to inspire a new generation of black artists.  “There’s a white middle-class club in British theatre and it can make the industry inaccessible to others – whether that’s performing, playwriting or simply being in the audience,” says Moji. “You can feel invisible, and I know a lot of black creatives with mental health issues as a result. “Utopia Theatre is all about giving erse people a voice. We showcase African culture and traditions, through classic plays and new material.” Last month, Utopia Theatre launched the Creative Hub, a free six-month programme of virtual workshops to combat the devastating effects of lockdown on the profession.

The animal, thought to be  to  weeks old, was seen hitting the road and rolling over a few times when, according to witnesses, it was thrown from a car driving towards Alsager just before pm.Another driver had to swerve to avoid hitting the female tabby kitten, pulled over to find it on the roadside with severe injuries, and rushed it to a nearby vet who then alerted the RSPCA for help, StokeonTrentLive reports.The RSPCA has released a photo of the injured kitten and an image of a dark blue car as part of its investigation. Inspector Caren Goodman-James said: “This is such a shocking incident. It is so upsetting to think anyone would consider doing this to an animal. “The car was on Audley Road just before the junction with Merelake Road and travelling towards Alsager from the A junction when Daisy was thrown out of the window. “The poor kitten was seen hitting the road and rolled over a few times before stopping. The witness in the car behind had to swerve to avoid hitting her and initially thought she was a piece of rubbish that had been thrown out of the car. It was only when the kitten moved her head up did they realise it was an animal and stopped their car to help. She added: “We are so grateful to the driver that stopped to help poor Daisy. This poor kitten was just thrown to the kerb like a piece of rubbish.  I have dealt with incidents of animals being dumped and abandoned before but this is extreme. It is very lucky that this little kitten survived. “The vet is hopeful that Daisy will pull through but the next  hours are crucial. Ms Goodman-James said the kitten has a pull injury to its tail, meaning it will need to be amputated. It also suffered a lower jaw fracture and head trauma.

The moniker has gone viral on social media, being used to depict a passive-aggressive, judgmental woman who is rude, quick to complain, often racist – and usually white and middle-aged. It surged during Black Lives Matter protests, when videos were circulated of white women – labelled Karens – clashing with demonstrators. But angry Karens are now demanding “respect” in a series of online petitions. Karen Button, from Wallingford, Oxfordshire, said she has “had enough”. She said being associated with women “who are racist or not law abiding is upsetting and unfair”. Another Karen wrote: “We are not Medusa-like beings or fire-breathing dragons. And WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT RACIST!!” She added she is not privileged and does not have a bad hairdo – other traits mocked in internet memes.  A third Karen wrote: “My parents gave me this name out of love. I refuse to change it because of cruel people on the internet.” The name consistently ranked in the top  in England and Wales between  and . But it has lost popularity in recent years, with just  UK babies named Karen in . Harry Potter author JK Rowling was labelled “a Karen” after saying young gay people were being “shunted” towards hormones and transgender surgery. Some argue negative use of Karen is steeped in sexism, as it demonises opinionated and assertive women.

The woman was booted off the American Airlines flight travelling from Ohio to North Carolina on July . Video footage taken by passenger Jordan Slade and shared on social media shows the moment the woman made her way off the plane. After the woman picked up her three bags and started to exit the aircraft, other passengers began to cheer and clap. The woman angrily turned around and shouted: You can clap all you want. A passenger responded by saying: Just leave. We have flights to get. Jesus.  All adult passengers travelling on American Airlines flights are required to wear a face covering due to the coronavirus pandmic.Ms Slade said the woman claimed she wasnapost wearing a mask because of a medical condition.The witness told the Daily Mail: She was argumentative from the gate. She demanded to be boarded first and was causing an obvious scene. Once boarded she was making phone calls and arguing with the attendant when asked to put her phone away. Ms Slade added: She also refused to wear a mask putting others on the flight at risk... Another passenger even got up to confront her about her behavior with no mask. A number of passengers reportedly spoke to flight attendants on the plane to voice concerns that they may miss their connecting flights. The incident took up so much time that after the woman was kicked off the flight the plane had to go back to the airport to refuel.    Ms Slade uploaded the video of passengers clapping and cheering the woman, branded a aposKarenapos, off the flight to Tik Tok, where it has been watched hundreds of thousands of times. Currently, more than , people have liked the video.  Clapping was % necessary, one person commented. Another said: The person beside her was literally wearing a mask and a face shield. If you canapost wear a mask on the plane then just drive wherever you need to go.The video was also shared on Twitter, where a number of users were quick to slam the woman.One said: Why the hell would someone pay for a flight and then forfeit their seat because they’re too stubborn to wear a mask  Why bother buying a ticket  How long was this flight  Surely it couldnapost be more than a few hours  Crazy. Another added: FANTASTIC! She had a choice - wear the mask or get off the plane - she made her choice to be selfish and self centered and not wear a mask for the safety of others on the plane - good riddance!  From July , American Airlines will require all customers over the age of two to wear face coverings on board planes and at airports. The company said passengers must keep their masks on from the time they enter their departure airport to the time they exit their arrival airport, except for while eating or drinking. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention one of the best ways we can slow the spread of Covid- is to wear a face covering, said Alison Taylor, chief customer officer of American Airlines.

For months officials in countries such as China, Japan and Hong Kong have been busy dousing public places in hypochlorous acid. The substance, which is known as HCIO, is formed by dissolving chlorine in water, and is dozens of times more effective at killing viruses than bleach. It is also incredibly cheap to produce. Despite having helpful cleansing properties, the acid is weak enough to pose little threat to humans and is used to keep swimming pool water clean. Earlier this week the UK government approved trials which will see HCIO sprayed in public places. The fact the use of the liquid has taken so long to be used in the UK, when its effectiveness where has been apparent for months, has been questioned by experts. Dr Darren Reynolds, professor in Health and Environment at the University of the West of England, told MailOnline: We should have used HOCl from the very start. It would have made a huge dference – but it’s still not too late. HOCI has been used to great effect in South Korea and has been praised as a key reason why the country has kept its coronavirus cases low.Not only is the liquid sprayed on the streets, people entering and exiting certain public places have been doused in a mist of HOCI. Workers heading home at the end of shts have been walking through arches which blast hypochlorous acid from the sides. The practice is not unheard of in the UK, where dental workers use hand held spray guns to kill bacteria and viruses on surfaces.  Rugby and football clubs may soon be getting in on the act. Trimite, a company which distributes fogging tunnels, says it is in discussions with some clubs to have their products installed.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July .

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and the outer rim of the p piece is obscured, the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must. One of the easiest ways to check them over is to reverse up to a reflective surface - such as a window or shiny garage door - then press the brake pedal and check in the rear-view mirror to ensure theyre working.SEATS AND SEAT BELTSFront seats should have a good range of motion, so slide them forward and back to make sure everything is moving freely and easily. Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too. They should be able to effectively clear the screen, leaving no streaks or making a rubbing noise. If thats the case, replace them ndash its a two-minute job on the vast majority of cars.ENGINE FLUIDS AND LEVELSIts best to make sure your car has plenty of fuel in the tank before you put it into its MOT, and its possible that you could be turned away from the test centreit doesnt have enough petrol or diesel. The same goes for engine oil ndash so check the levels of this are correct too."},{"url":null,"title":"absolutely-vital-shop-local-save-high-streets","story":"The Scotland Loves Local campaign has launched across the country to encourage Scots to go back to their roots, think local first and support their local high streets safely and in line with public healthguidelines.The Coronaviruspandemic has hit high streets and local businesses hard - now is the time to support them to get back on their feet.

You think Harry Potters magic  Just look around you.\"That curiosity is our biggest asset because thats how we learn to adapt, thats how we learn to survive, thats how we learn to cope with the world around us as it changes.\"Lloyd, who previously worked as a Sunday Timesjournalist, was inspired to begin a career as a childrens author after seeing the joy his children experienced when they learnt new things during their years in home-schooling.Particularly that of one of his daughters who was astonished to learn all about Antarctica ndash home of her then favourite animal, the penguin.\"I believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd said.\"Then things start to get in the way, like puberty and your friendship groups change and going from primary to secondary school.\"But at the age of nine or  youve got that purity of curiosity where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy,

residents, protesting against cherished recreational area Elcho Green, at North Berwickrsquos West Bay, being utilised for an -space long-stay car park.The local authority said in a statement last Tuesday that, as part of ious measures inNorth Berwick to provide extra space for physical distancing to protect public health and suppress a resurgence of Covid-, including widening pavements at the east end of High Street, it would be ldquoconverting part of Elcho Green to a temporary car park to support access to the High Street area.It stated that ldquofollowing a meeting with local traders, North Berwick CommunityCouncil and North Berwick Coastal Area Partnership, agreement has been reached to introduce a number of temporary measures in the town ndash but both the community council and area partnership told the Courier they had not given backing to the Elcho Green changes.The councilrsquos own timetable had Elcho Green car park opening last Friday .An online petition, West Bay not Parking Bay, to ldquoprotect stunning and iconic West Bay in North Berwick, was launched by resident Sarah Russell and had attracted more than , signatures in less than a week.It said: ldquoEast Lothian Council have announced plans to turn Elcho Green into a longstay car park.ldquoWhilst the council state that this is a temporary measure to comply with their Covid Spaces for People initiative, it is greatly feared that this will, in fact, lead to a permanent car park in the most iconic seafront location in East Lothian.\"North Berwick residents and visitors alike will be robbed of the very essence of this beautul recreational space that personies this famous conservation area seafront.ldquoTemporary or otherwise, Elcho Green is not the correct location for any car parking and we would urge you to help us stop this environmental catastrophe.Among those supporting the campaign was world-famous golfer and North Berwick resident Catriona Matthew, captain of Europersquos winning Solheim Cup team.The Courier has been swamped with letters and emails against the plans .The scheme was described as ldquoindefensible and ldquoundemocratic vandalism by some residents, while many asked why there had not been specic consultation on the plan and highlighted that the land had been gted to the town by the late Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple for recreational use in .On Monday, East Lothian Council released a statement that it was placing the ldquoElcho Green temporary car parking proposal on hold to allow us a further opportunity to engage and consult.It is the second time in a month that the councilrsquos plans to transform town centres have hit the buffers.Earlier in July, proposals to suspend parking in town centres were put ldquoon hold after traders and residents in Haddington reacted with anger as cones and parking suspension signs were put up overnight, sparking widespread concern.In Mondayrsquos statement, Councillor Norman Hampshire , environment spokesperson, said: ldquoEast Lothian Council has successfully implemented a number of physical distancing measures on North Berwick High Street to support the need for safe access to the town centre and economic recovery.ldquoA further support for Spaces for People was a proposal to utilise a small part of Elcho Green in North Berwick as a temporary car park.ldquoThe benefit of this would have been a reduction in the number of vehicles circling and queuing for parking spaces, enhanced safety for pedestrians and cyclists within the town centre, and improved air quality.ldquoEast Lothian Council is a listening authority and we are aware of the ious perspectives being raised within the North Berwick community.ldquoAs such, we intend to place the Elcho Green temporary car parking proposal on hold to allow us a further opportunity to engage and consult.\"This delay will also enable us to monitor the impact of increased traffic as a result of visitors and to assess the effectiveness of measures introduced.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said that recent u-turns were down to a ldquolack of political leadership within the Labour administration.He said he received more than  emails objecting to the Elcho Green plans.He called for a report on the Spaces for People plans, and in particular parking proposals in North Berwick, to be put before a meeting of elected council group leaders in two weeksrsquo time for approval.Under emergency Covid- procedures, normal council business is currently suspended and decisions are taken at monthly meetings of the group leaders and council chief executive.He said: ldquoThe decision must be approved by councillors at the leadersrsquo group meeting and it should be open and transparent and open to the press.Mr Hampshire accused Mr Currie of ldquoplaying politics in ldquoan emergency situation.ldquoWe have allowed him to take part in the meetings with officers at every point during the discussions, said Mr Hampshire.ldquoI have got to say the Conservative Group have been fully behind what we are doing.\"For the SNP to try to play politics in a situation where their own Government is instructing local authorities to create spaces in town centres is unbelievable.Conservative councillor Craig Hoy called on the administration to ldquotake notice of the recent problems caused by parking proposals.He said the Scottish Government had failed to give councils enough time to push through emergency Covid measures in town centres.Councillor Hoy said: \"Scottish Councils are operating under huge pressure with limited resources, but that does not remove the need for them to consult fully and communicate clearly on big issues which impact our communities.\"I hope East Lothian Council and the Labour administration will take notice of the recent problems in North Berwick and fully engage with stakeholders.\"Hilary Smith, chair of North Berwick Coastal Area Partnership, stressed that the area partnership had not attended any meeting regarding Covid- plans for the town or given its approval to the plans.North Berwick Community Council said it had not discussed Elcho Green prior to its meeting on Tuesday.East Lothian Council received pound.million from Scottish Government funding for Spaces for People projects to make social distancing easier in town centres and encourage people toto them safely.The council launched a consultation in May, asking people for their county-wide views.It attracted , contributions and more than  comments, including more than  from the North Berwick area.But North Berwick residents have not been asked their specic views on Elcho Green car parking.The council said it had given consideration to parking availability at a number of sites in North Berwick.In response to questions from the Courier, the council said: ldquoThe high school and sports centre are both due to re-open in coming weeks so were unsuitable to use.ldquoAn area of Elcho Green is considered suitable to take traffic arriving from the west to park for people visiting the town to intercept the flow of traffic and stop vehicles circulating through the town unnecessarily searching for parking spaces and generating additional traffic pollution.ldquoIt also seemed reasonable considering the area of land is used annually for Fringe by the Sea events.\"A maximum of  places had been identied for use as a potential temporary car park which is not part of the Spaces for People grant but provided as part of the programme."},{"url":null,"title":"world-famous-singer-pops-east-lothian-cafe","story":"Sam visited JoLi, based in The Old Reading Rooms on Longniddryrsquos Main Street.Sam is said to have bought a

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!DURING lockdown, I was trying to make the most of my free time ndash going on daily walks, working on my website, editing photos from before lockdown, designing my first book and completing A LOT of jigsaws .After the lockdown restrictions started to ease, I was able to spend even more time outdoors than I would normally do. I dedicated June to visiting dferent local sites to watch the kingfisher ndash which you may remember from my previous article ndash a family of wrens and the brown hares.One evening, as I was uploading my photographs on to social media and searching through the pages, I came across a few images of a bird that every birder wanted to see since its influx to the UK was published. It was a rosy starling!The beautul rosy starlinglooks nothing like the starlings we know. It strongly resembles a magpiewith a much shorter tail.This species is unmistakable in its adult plumage. The male has a pale pink body with a black head, wings, and tail. Additionally, during the breeding season the male develops a wispy crest and the black colour becomes glossier with a purplish green or blue sheen.The female is less vibrant than the male. Both sexes appear much duller outside of their breeding season.Furthermore, the rosy starling does not mimic other species, unlike its well-known cousin.What the two species have in common is murmuration ndash an astonishing and mesmerising aerial spectacle large flocks of these birds gather and perform a real show as they swoop, e and swirl across the sky in beautul shape-shting clouds. It is a phenomenon that pleases the eye of every observer.The rosy starlingrsquos breeding area stretches from the Balkans and Turkey to Central Asia and north-west China. It spends winters in India and south-east Arabia. As a strongly migratory species, it can travel outside of its normal breeding range. As a result, there are signicant periodic summer and autumn influxes in western Europe. The causes of such irruptions are not yet fully understood however, it appears to be related to changes in the population of locusts on which the birds feed.Imagine my amazement when I read that one of those birds had landed and made its temporary home in someonersquos garden in Port Seton!The cherry on the cake was that the night when I saw the first images of the rosy starling in East Lothian, I also received an email from Stuart Payne ndash the lucky host of the rosy starling. Stuart invited me to his garden.The next morning, my fianceacute Chris and I rushed to Port Seton. As we were walking towards Stuartrsquos house, we saw another birder looking around hoping to spot the rosy starling. As soon as we arrived at Stuartrsquos house, I saw this magnicent pink bird flying past the house and landing on the bird feeder to start its feast.Stuart and his we Gillian welcomed us in their garden, where I spent half an hour photographing the gorgeous rosy starling and chatting to Stuart and Gillian. I also took some time to admire their beautul dogs Hugo and Hobbes. These dogs were just wonderful, not every day you see dogs as well behaved as these two!My first and, I hope, not last experience with the rosy starling was unforgettable!

council has already received two strikes over its ambitious plans to transform its town centres this month, with u-turns made twice on projects.At the start of July it unveiled its plans, which included introducing parking suspensions across town centres as it looked to create more space outside shops and relocate parking away from high streets.In Haddington town centre there was a furious response after cones and parking suspension notices went up over the first weekend of the changes, leaving traders and their customers fuming.Shop owners who had only just opened their doors feared the restrictions would stop costumers fromcoming to the market town and within days the council announced it was putting parking suspensions in all town centres on hold.Then last week, it announced plans to transform tourist hotspot North Berwickrsquos town centre and create a temporary -space car park on its iconic Elcho Green ndash a much-loved publicspace and putting green.The response from the community, including Solheim Cup captain Catriona Matthew, who voiced concern at losing green space like the Green, saw those plans also shelved as the local authority insisted it was a

There was cloud cover, no wind and a sticky humidity. I was almost eaten alive.Scotlands walks are never complete without the dreaded midgeBelieve me, I have tried everything to keep the midges at bay. Among the long list of suggestions that Ive given a whirl are eating Marmite sandwiches, spraying a fine mist of Listerine and taking garlic tablets .Smoke can act as a deterrent, which has seen me huddling next to barbecues and bonfires like they are two-bar electric fires on cold winter mornings.Ive donned midge nets that give me the forlorn air of a beekeeper who has lost her hive, or a grieving Victorian widow. Im considering putting up bat boxes after reading that a lone bat can eat , midges in one night.Citronella and Saltidinare among the ingredients that midges are said to find repugnant and give a wide berth.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Kathyrsquos plans to train as a nurse are derailed, however, when she gets pregnant. Then, Tom Branning dies and the stud farm founders, forcing the family to leave home on the outbreak of war. Following their ious fortunes through the Second World War, Goodwin brings closure to her series, but not without putting her characters through the wringer, with some unexpectedly dark and grisly developments which might leave dedicated followers of the saga feeling like theyrsquove been put through the wringer themselves."},{"url":null,"title":"walk-culzean-castle-cliff-walk","story":"Grade: Easy walkDistance:  miles kmTime:  hoursTHE first time I visited Culzean Castle I was overwhelmed by the grandeur of the place. Robert Adamrsquos clf-top mansion overlooks the Firth of Clyde near Maybole in Ayrshire and is certainly a huge symbol of privilege and wealth. However, standing as it does in a  hectare estate of parks, woodland, beaches and clftops it makes an excellent destination for an autumnal daytrip and this shortish walk enables you to see the best of it.The castle itself was built in the late th century and was commissioned by David Kennedy, the Earl of Cassillis, a man who was apparently lsquokeen to impress with his wealth and statusrsquo. He wanted the lsquocountry housersquo to be the seat of his earldom.Later in its le Culzean Casle became the home of the Marquis of Ailsa, Chief of the Clan Kennedy but in , facing crippling inheritance tax, the family gave the building and grounds to the National Trust for Scotland who continue to look after it to this day. A suite of rooms on the top floor were given to US President Dwight D Eisenhower in recognition of his role as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe during the Second World War. When I was a youngster I was more impressed by the fact that the Scottish entertainer Jimmy Logan lived in a rented apartment in the castle.Irsquom not a great fan of country houses but I was keen to have a walk around the grounds and, as much as possible, gaze on its clf-top setting from the sea-shore. To reach the clfs I dropped down some steps by the castle entrance to reach the castle gardens from where a path through a gap in the wall led me into a grassy area. A track led me through some fine deciduous woods before dropping down to reach the very attractive Swan Pond. I passed along its north shore before following a signpost to the clfs.This is the best part of the walk with views across the Firth of Clyde towards Arran and the low-lying Kintyre Peninsula beyond. There are good views too of Paddyrsquos Milestone, or the Ailsa Craig as it is properly known. And itrsquos here that you get the best appreciation of how well situated Culzean Castle is. It absolutely dominates the shoreline, and I guess that was the intention of Robert Adam the architect.I wandered along to the end of the path before ing to the Swan Pond and the road back to the car park. All the way along I kept wondering what the view from the Eisenhower apartment must be like, gazing out onto that great spread of water and the wonderful skyline of the Isle of Arran. Alas, Eisenhower only visited his apartment half a dozen times. What a waste.CAMERON MCNEISHROUTE PLANNERMap: OS :, Explorer sheet  Distance:  miles kmTime:  hoursStart Finish: Culzean Castle car park .Information: www.nts.org.uk visit places culzeanNote: There is a charge for entry to the Country Park .Route:Leave car park, turn R and follow road to reach castle entrance.

or reduce non-heterosexual attraction or sexual behaviours, or to change an inidualrsquos gender identity to match the sex they were assigned at birth\".The Canadian legislation, which was introduced earlier this year, proposes five new criminal offences related to conversion therapy.These include causing a minor to undergo conversion therapy,causing a person to undergo it against their will and profiting from or advertising conversion therapy.The Holyrood petitioners insist the practice has \"damaged generations of LGBT+ young people and adults and continues to do so\".They quoted a report from the charity Stonewall, which found  per cent of health and care staff had witnessed colleagues expressing the view that lesbian, gay and bisexual people can be ldquocured of their sexual orientation.They also referenced a survey by theOzanne Foundation, which works withreligious organisations to eliminate discrimination based on sexuality or gender.This found .% of respondents had ldquobeen advised to consider attempts to change their sexual orientationand just over one in sevenhad ldquovoluntarily considered it.The petitioners said: \"Concerningly, .% of LGBT+ respondents had been forced to go through attempts to change their sexual orientation.\"Almost two-thirds, .%, had \"suffered from mental health issues\" as a result of the conversion therapy, including nearly a third who said they had attempted suicide.The Holyrood petition notes: \"These responses clearly show that there is a signicant public health case for banning conversion therapy.\"The experiences of those who were put through this practice show that enforcing this ban should fall under criminal law.\"Both of these areas fall within the devolved powers of the Scottish Parliament.\"It said the UK Government has yet to act despite committing to end the practice years ago.It added: \"Given this information, it is clear that conversion therapy is a risk to public health, especially the mental health of vulnerable young adults and children.\"There is broad support for its criminalisation by those who have been subjected to it, and, as healthcare and criminal justice matter, we believe it to be within the scope of the Scottish Governmentrsquos powers to ensure this practice is brought to an end.\"Gray raised concerns the UK plans will be kicked into the long grass.The -year-old said: \"I think it should fall under criminal law, and that is something that is shared by people who have undergone it.\"People who have been through conversion therapy overwhelmingly support it being banned, and I think half of them support it being an area for criminal law.\"I think they are the people who should be listened to on this.\"People who have been subjected to conversion therapy should be the people we listen to most.\"I think it should come down under criminal law, and I think the justication for that partly includes it being a public health issue.\"He said it is an issue that should gain \"universal support\" from Scotlands political parties.Jordan Daly, co-founder of Time for Inclusive Education , a charity working to address anti-LGBT bullying in schools, is one of those backing the petition.He said: ldquoConversion or reparative therapies should have been outlawed a long time ago, and practices which ly claim to change, cure or repair an inidualrsquos sexual orientation or gender identity or expression have been shown time and again to be emotionally and psychologically traumatic on those who have experienced and survived such programs.\"He said practices which rely on \"using emotionally exploitative tactics to encourage feelings of shame and repression in iniduals are active in Scotland right now\".He added: \"We support this petition and the efforts of campaigners to continue raising awareness about the existence of dangerous and shameful practices in our country.\"Scotland has an opportunity to lead the UK here, and ensure that no other LGBT person, young or old, experiences this ndash ministers and parliamentarians should not delay in taking it.SNP equalities minister Christina McKelvie said: ldquoWe do not support or advocate the practice of conversion therapy.\"It is unethical, harmful and has no place in Scotland.\"We fully support moves by the UK Government to end conversion therapy, and are engaging with them as they develop proposals.ldquoThe legislative timetable for the current parliamentary session is currently fully committed.\"We are continuing to engage with officials in the UK Government on their thinking as it develops, and this will include consideration of devolved and reserved responsibilities as they relate to this practice."},{"url":null,"title":"big-read-pen-mightier-sword-political-cartoons-needed-ever","story":"IN November , Lord Halax, the British foreign secretary, ed to Britain after meeting Joseph Goebbels. Halax, an architect of appeasement, wanted to ensure peace between Nazi Germany and Britain. One of his first tasks after the Berlin trip was to contact the publishers of the Evening Standard about the problematic matter of a cartoonist called David Low.Throughout the s, Low had lampooned Hitler in the pages of the British press. Halax told the Standard: ldquoYou cannot imagine the frenzy these cartoons cause. As soon as a copy of the Evening Standard arrives, it is pounced on for Lowrsquos cartoons, andit is of Hitler, as it usually is, telephones buzz, tempers rise, fevers mount, and the whole government system of Germany is in uproar.Nobody at the paper would rein in Low, so it fell to Halax to intercede personally. He took Low to lunch and laid his cards on the table. Low listened and replied: ldquoDo I understand you to say that you would find it easier to promote peacemy cartoons did not irritate the Nazi leaders personally Halax said yes. Low later explained: ldquoOf course, he was the foreign secretary hellip So I said, lsquoVery well, I donrsquot want to be responsible for a world warrsquo.In his own words, Low ldquoslowed down a bit. That didnrsquot last long, though. No cartoonist could resist satirising Hitler. Kicking the living hell out of power is part of the job description, after all.Soon Low would go on to draw his masterpiece, ldquoRendezvous, which satirised the grotesquely cynical peace deal between Hitler and Stalin ndash the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact that helped pave the path to war. In the cartoon, Hitler and Stalin are shown courteously meeting each other across a dead body. Hitler doffs his cap and says charmingly, ldquoThe scum of the earth, I believe . Stalin replies, with equal grace, ldquoThe bloody assassin of the workers, I presume .Low understood exactly the power of his pen. He once said: ldquoNo dictator is inconvenienced or even displeased by cartoons showing his terrible person stalking through blood and mud. That is the kind of idea about himself that the power-seeking world-beater would want to propagate. It not only feeds his vanity, but unfortunately it shows profitable s in an awed world. What he does not want to get around is the idea that he is an ass, which is really damaging. And there, in one historical vignette, the power of the political cartoon is neatly summed up.Bye bye BellTherersquos been much worry over the future of satire in Britain and the rest of the Western world of late, as so-called cancel culture wends its way through all avenues of the media from film to print. A short while ago, it emerged thatnewspaper was not to renew the contract of its cartoonist Steve Bell. The move came not long after the departure of a senior editor at another bastion of the so-called liberal press, The New York Times. James Bennet had published a piece by a republican senator calling for military force to put down violent protests. It caused outrage. He resigned. A high-profile columnist with the paper then also resigned. Bari Weiss claimed the paper was effectively being edited by Twitterrsquos ldquowoke brigade.Steve Bellrsquos cartooning is brutal, hersquos cruel. Depending on your political point of view, hersquos a comic genius one day, an utter villain the next. His withering caricatures can define a politician and overshadow their career. Bellrsquos portrayal of John Major wearing his Y-fronts over his trousers summed up the mediocrity of the man as Prime Minister. Hersquos drawn David Cameron as a human condom, and George Osborne as an SM gimp. His portrayal of Alex Salmond as a Saltire-faced, tartan oaf riled nationalists during the  referendum. Likewise, his cartoon of Margaret Thatcher, after her death, sliding into hell and asking ldquowhy is this pit still open  outraged Conservatives.Deliberately upsetting people, using nasty stereotypes, punching below the belt ndash when it comes to dealing with power Bell, like most great cartoonists, is happy to use any tactic. However, hersquos also faced opprobrium over some of his cartoons such as one showing Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu holding Tony Blair like a glove puppet. The cartoon was seen as playing with anti-Semitic tropes. Recently his caricature of Home Secretary Priti Patel also got him in serious trouble. He drew Patel quite literally as a fat cow, complete with a ring in her nose. As Patel is of Hindu origin, and the cow scared in Hinduism, he brought fury down upon himself.Soon, amid newspaper layoffs, it emerged that his contract was scheduled not to be renewed. The Jewish Chronicle reported that the moves were ldquosaid to be unrelated to the latest round of redundancies. In June , Bell clashed with rsquos top executives when he complained that he felt ldquounfairly traduced and censored after the paper wouldnrsquot run a cartoon showing a Palestinian burning in a fireplace while Netanyahu and Theresa May sit talking. Bell said editor Katharine Viner did ldquonot really have an argument for spiking his drawing.A few days ago, Bell himself tweeted that his departure was nothing to do with Patel, but rather job cuts at the paper. However, his loss has prompted many in the media to speculate that hersquos another scalp for cancel culture.Wicked clownsIf the political cartoonist has an historical ancestor, itrsquos the court jester. In the medieval court, the jester could get away with anything. The jester could mock royalty, insult palace favourites, and point out the failings of everyone from bishops to potentates. Sometimes, jesters lost their heads, but mostly their patrons welcomed their caustic comedy. It reminded the powerful that they were human and could make stupid mistakes just like the rest of us.Of course, throughout the history of cartooning, not all artists have worked for the greater good or held power to account. Some have acted in bad faith and given succour to dictators like the cartoonists for Nazi newspapers such as Der Sturmer which drew Jews as devils and snakes.The most important issue for any political cartoon is this: what direction itrsquos punching. Is it punching up ndash at the powerful, greedy and dangerous  Or punching down at the weak  If we agree that punching up is the right thing to do ndash then is any tactic fair game  Can stereotypes be used  Until not so long ago, we expected cartoonists to deploy any trick in the book as long as they hit their mark ndash and most importantly made us laugh and think. Now, times are changing. Will that lessen the power of satire at a time when we need it most ndash in an era of populism, hate mobs, and unaccountable power and wealth  The bottom-line question for today is this: can a cartoon really workit is so sanitised that it upsets absolutely nobody The art of offenceIn his excellent book, The Art Of Controversy: Political Cartoons And Their Enduring Power, the American journalist Victor Navasky tells a story which sums up the impossibility of ever finding a cartoon which both hits its mark and offends nobody.Navasky was editing the US magazine The Nation when cartoonist David Levine brought him a drawing of Henry Kissinger ndash the former US secretary of state, seen by many on the left as a warmonger. The cartoon, ldquoScrewing the World, depicted the body of a woman with a head like a globe of the world lying on a bed, her fingers clutching the sheets. On top of her, his body just covered by a Stars and Stripes blanket, is Kissinger, his face contorted with wolfish pleasure. For some, the image absolutely expresses Kissingerrsquos treatment of the world. For others, and in this case many of the Nationrsquos staff, it was sexist and unacceptable.Navasky was collared by his team and asked: ldquoWhy isnrsquot he doing it to a Third World male Good question. But, of course,Kissinger had been shown raping an African man, itrsquos pretty obvious where the anger would come from regarding that reworked cartoon.A history of mischief and sufferingCartoons have been about since Egypt in BC ndash and theyrsquore always grotesque, cruel and offensive. Asking for a cartoonist not to cause offence is like asking a bird not to fly ndash itrsquos innate.Despite ancient caricaturists leaving scratchings in stone mocking almighty leaders like the Pharaoh Akhenaten, the political cartoon is really a creature of the modern age, finding its feet in the s with the English artists William Hogarth and James Gillray. Hogarth satirised society. He was a moralist who tried to expose the failings of the people ndash both rich and poor ndash in works like A Harlotrsquos Progress, A Rakersquos Progress and Gin Lane, a vision of a barbarous drunken London where alcohol is more important than the lives of children.Gillray had two main targets: the excesses of the French Revolution, and the greed of the British ruling class. In his cartoon The Plumb Pudding in Danger he shows the British Prime Minister William Pitt carving up the world with Napoleon. In other European countries at the time, such mockery could have ended with the artist on the gallows. Gillrayrsquos cartoon A Voluptuary Under the Horrors of Digestion portrays a fat, greedy, spoilt Prince Regent, who would go on to be George IV. When Gillray felt the press was too grovelling towards the Duchess of York he drew the cartoon The Duchessrsquos Little Shoes Yielding to the Magnitude of the Dukersquos Foot ndash which effectively showed the aristocratic pair having sex.By the early th century, cartoons were a staple of every newspaper in the democratic world. The cartoon was there to both reflect the politics of the paper and its readers, and to challenge their beliefs. Readers expected their daily cartoon to cause offence ndash either to them or others. And matters effectively stayed like that for the next century ndash although of course the cartoon went underground behind the Iron Curtain as it satirised the absurdities of Soviet le.Perhaps, the greatest practitioner of the modern cartoon is Ralph Steadman. Now aged , Steadman skewered the powerful from the late-s onwards. For instance, in his inimitable surreal, ink-splattered style he nailed the fear brought about by the rise of the former Hollywood actor Ronald Reagan to the US presidency.In Reaganrsquos Latest Close-Up, the President looms over Lady Liberty, holding her in a movie star embrace, while dressed as Dracula, his teeth sharp and ready to bite.But cartooning never comes without its cost. In , the Palestinian cartoonist Naji al-Ali ndash who lambasted both Israel and the PLO ndash was murdered on his way to work. In , the Sri Lankan cartoonist Jfry Yoonoos was beaten and stabbed. In , Yemenrsquos Saleh Ali was arrested after he published a cartoon showing a Yemeni man being arrested as one policeman declared ldquoDemocracy is what I say. In Cameroon, Belarus, Iran, and Syria, cartoonists have been subjected to violence, censorship and persecution.Some have said that the clash between cartooning and Islam represents the ultimate expression of cancel culture ndash the act of murdering someone because they caused you offence in art form.In , Denmarkrsquos Jyllands-Posten newspaper published cartoons mocking Islam. Many depicted Mohammed and were seen by Muslims as blasphemous. Death threats were made, cartoonists went into hiding, demonstrations began around the world. By , an estimated  people had been killed as a result of protests and anger.Some years later, in , the satirical French magazine, Charlie Hebdo, published a caricature of Mohammed on its front cover. Its offices were firebombed. In , the magazine published more cartoons deemed offensive to Islam. In January , Islamist terrorists attacked the magazinersquos office. Twelve people died, including cartoonists Cabu and Charb.In the immediate wake of the attack, the West embraced the slogan ldquoJe Suis Charlie as an expression of solidarity with artists murdered simply for daring to draw what they thought. However, quickly, that slogan began to stale for some.There are many who would now no longer stand with Charlie. The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Liberties went into victim-blaming mode. ldquoKilling in response to insult, no matter how gross, must be unequivocally condemned. That is why what happened in Paris cannot be tolerated. But neither should we tolerate the kind of intolerance that provoked this violent reaction, said its president Bill Donohue. He was not the only such voice.In this era of social media and political extremism, when offence-taking is as ubiquitous as sand on a beach, cartoonists find themselves in the crosshairs more than ever before in the Western world.When it comes to free speech, cartoons are often ugly speech. But thatrsquos the point ndash theyrsquore meant to offend. Andugly, offensive speech isnrsquot defended, what happens to the concept of free speech  A silent world without offence really would be no laughing matter."},{"url":null,"title":"ron-mckays-diary-distant-relatives-frasers-perhaps-scotlands-unfortunate-family","story":"Her house is Beaufort Castle, which she bought together with the surrounding acres in .

In the run-up to hostilities I was in Baghdad when the ldquododgy dossier was published in the British Parliament, allegedly naming the sites of chemical weaponsrsquo production, and going to them with British journalists and TV crews and finding nothing because there was nothing to find.Nonetheless the war proceeded.

Theatre buildings are designed on that premise.ldquoTo have performers socially distant would demand creation from scratch of an entirely new repertoire of work right across all performance genres.She added: ldquoFor obvious reasons large gatherings were first to close down, in the same vein we anticipate theatres to be the last to open up again.ldquoFrom having spoken to our network of venue operators across the country, the general consensus, at this point in time, is that March or April  is the most likely date for the theatre industry to restart.ldquoMargins for Capital Theatres, as a large-scale commercial operator, are tight.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer. Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel. If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing. Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport. Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond. The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful. They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff. Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing. “We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping. “You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.”The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked. They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place. Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

The gradual easing of restrictions will hopefully ensure that our ious activities can continue to take place.“As District Chair, I have chosen Special Olympics as my Charity for this year and I look forward to engaging with all of our Clubs in supporting this particular group – as well, of course, as the myriad of local charities which our members support over the years. I look forward to working closely with our friends across the Rotary family. I am also indebted to the members of my local Club for all of their encouragement and support.” Patricia took up her new role on  July and will continue for  months. She is planning to attend the International Inner Wheel Convention in Japur in India next Spring – subject, of course, to easing of travel restrictions.

This year, though, there was a real threat of #The Port# being the town that was all dressed up with nowhere to go.There had been no fanfare Easter weekend opening of family favourite Barry#s Amusements. The caravan parks were shut, hotels closed and apartments unavailable to visitors.Today there are still no screams of fright and delight, as the doors remain firmly shut on the famous old building that has attracted fun lovers through the decades. There#s no ride on the old ghost train. Copper coins will find a dferent home instead of the slots in the arcade.But where in the town the sparkle is starting to .The mums are back, tissues in hand to mop up dribbles of ice-cream from small faces. All the seats along the seafront are taken for a welcome breath of fresh north coast air. If anything, the town is busier than during last July#s Open. No golf to distract, no Barry#s to chuck p coins into those slots in the hope of winning a clatter of copper. Instead, visitors are nose to tail along the main street, and it#s come just in the nick of time for the shops and cafes.Andy Hill has been running Troggs Surf Shop since  and said Monday was one of the best he can remember.It#s incredibly busy. It#s all domestic custom, we#ve hardly seen a foreign tourist, he said.The beaches are very busy indeed. A lot of people were probably going stir crazy at home and just needed to see the ocean and get some salt water therapy.We#re selling an awful lot of body boards, surfboards and wetsuits. The beach is a natural asset that we have and it#s great to see people using it. Of course it#s a huge disappointment that Barry#s isn#t open, but people seem to be making the best of it, and thankfully the weather is helping.Monday was probably one of the busiest days I#ve ever had here. If everyone did holiday at home every year it would be a marvellous boost to the whole economy. Some will be quite surprised when they come here. A lot of visitors have been telling us what a brilliant time they#re having on the north coast.Along the street, Alice Rohdich presides over the family jewellers and souvenir shop, which has been in business since  and has never known a time like it.We#re missing the tourists from further afield, but we#re certainly making up for it with homegrown visitors, she said. The town has had to evolve this year. We can#t change what#s happening.We did invest in more Irish souvenirs this year as we#d expected more people from overseas on the back of the golf last year, but that hasn#t happened. But thankfully we#re getting our share of what#s going and we#re feeling much more positive. We would previously have had early morning and late evening trade, but now, with plenty of day trippers, the middle of the day is when most arrive. You can#t really visit Portrush without grabbing a stick of rock and Ann Lamont has been selling sweets and confectionery at Wilma#s just across from Barry#s.It has really picked up this last week, she said. We do sell some Irish souvenirs, but that#s not what people from Northern Ireland are after and that#s who we#ve had in the town.But they#re still able to get their sweets, buckets and spades.The weather has been good and usually, especially at nighttime, Barrys would be a big draw for us. Most of my family have worked in there at some stage.A few miles# drive along the Atlantic coast, Portstewart has always been known as a quieter seaside town than its neighbour, but it has reawakened with vigour over the past two weeks.There#s the usual crawl of traffic along the ocean front. Across the bay the sun glints once again off the cars lining the famous Strand. Orderly queues form outside the many ice-cream parlours. There are smiles again on faces as they take good of the fresh sea air. And customers are like a breath of fresh air, too, for the myriad of seafront shops.It#s great to have the doors open again and see people out and about again, said Siobhan Farthing at home and lestyle shop A Broader Picture.We#re obviously having to keep numbers down in the shop, but it#s such a relief to get the doors open again. There#s a real psychological boost to being by the sea and so many people have told us they#re delighted to be back.Missing out on their day by the seaside, though, were face coverings. Few and far between along the proms, it seems a decent face mask might be considered a hindrance to getting the full benefit of the sea air.

Both apps were designed by Co Waterford company NearForm.Speaking to the Belfast , Stephen Shaw from Big Motive, the company that designed the app, explained that there is a real concern amongst those involved in its development that the general public may not be aware just how useful the contact tracing service could be.You#re talking about avoiding potential future lockdowns, he stated. All of the code, information and everything about the app will be open sourced and public.Read More Pub worker blames coronavirus visor for fall down stairs and is suing Dublin barAnyone that#s worried about it tracking them will be able to access everything about the app and see and check that it#s not doing anything untoward.The Information Commissioner#s Office has been through everything. The higher echelons of the UK Government has scrutinised all elements of it too.People can be genuinely confident that it#s not doing anything dodgy.The app is compatible with the contact tracing service available in the Republic of Ireland and is expected to work with the app being created by the NHS in Great Britain.Mr Shaw explained that this is due to a federated server which is currently being developed for the app.This server will also allow the app to work with other European countries who have a tracing service in the same format, something Mr Shaw called a world first.When asked why Northern Ireland will be the first country in the United Kingdom to launch the app, Mr Shaw praised the work of the Department of Health#sChief Digital Information Officer, Dan West, and the app#s product manager, Dr Eddie O#Neill.Dan West is leading the project and he has been super dynamic and extremely good at bringing together all dferent aspects like the DoH and the Public Health Agency, he said.Along with Dr Eddie O#Neill, the pair of them seem to have a great handle on the subtleties of what technology should be used. The two of them have been instrumental.Meanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann has asked his cross-border counterpart to consider new laws and data-sharing agreements to help track international travellers arriving on the island.Mr Swann has written to Stephen Donnelly expressing concern about the inability of both jurisdictions to capture and share information about passengers transiting through one part of the island to the other. In the letter, Mr Swann told Mr Donnelly that his officials were facing serious impediments in monitoring travellers who cross the border having landed in the Irish Republic from an at-risk country.Such passengers are required to self-isolate in Northern Ireland for  days.Mr Swann said the system was reliant on people filling in a passenger locator form within  hours of entering Northern Ireland.He saidthey failed to fill in those forms, the authorities north of the border had no way of tracing them.

Enforcement and Removal Operations Boston officers still continue their duties even during these trying times.He added: Those who believe they can hide in the US from their crimes including terrorist activities they committed in other countries are in for a rude awakening. ICE remains committed to removing dangerous foreign nationals from the US, even those who may have managed to evade immigration law for a y period of time.The statement added: ICE is focused on removing public safety threats, such as convicted criminal aliens and gang members, as well as iniduals who have violated our nation#s immigration laws and those convicted of terrorist activities, including those who illegally re-entered the country after being removed and immigration fugitives ordered removed by federal immigration judges.Belfast Most ReadThe Earl and Countess of Erne on their magical wedding and le at Crom CastleCoronavirus: Travellers arriving in Northern Ireland from Spain to quarantine for  daysVideo: Man charged after crash involving allegedly stolen carIRA bomber released under peace deal deported from United States The childhood tragedy that haunts BBC NI gardening expert Diarmuid Gavin ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Alliance and Green parties also back the proposal, but DUP MLA Christopher Stalford says it could have disastrous repercussions for the area.The initiative would see restaurants and bars expand outdoors in a European cafe culture system. It would help those businesses struggling to remain viable in light of social distancing guidelines.However, other local businesses say that closing the Ormeau Road at weekends could decimate their trade, and some residents have expressed concerns about potential street drunkenness, litter and parking.Under the original proposals much of the Ormeau Road would be shut to traffic every weekend in summer. Following a consultation exercise, that plan has been reduced to one weekend, and to one Saturday and one Sunday before autumn. The #Open Ormeau# idea originated with Ciaran Fox, a director at the Royal Society of Architects.Mr Stalford said: Open Ormeau is a well-intentioned but ill-conceived idea. The main beneficiaries will be pubs and restaurants who do not make up the majority of businesses on the road. Other businesses are dead against it. Those who do the majority of their trade at the weekend will be hurt.If the Ormeau Road is closed, cars will go down the Ravenhill, which is already very busy so it has implications for residents there.Fergal McAdam, owner of homeware store Neptune, said that  of  business owners he had spoken to opposed the plan.It will kill businesses a mile north and a mile south, he said. The Ormeau Road is an arterial route. When you close the blood supply to an artery, you kill the limb.While such a proposal may bring benefits to the hospitality industry, it did not work in a mixed retail area, he added.Michael Goggin, owner of Michel#s Fruit, said: I#ve put my heart and soul into building my business here for  years and this plan will lose me customers and will effectively help the big supermarkets. The Ormeau Road works perfectly as it is. This will lead to drinking on the street and no social distancing.The name #Open Ormeau# is wrong. It#s effectively about closing and restricting things.But Paul Smyth of Ballynafeigh Community Development Association said there was strong support for Open Ormeau. There is a lot of positivity about it. Almost , people took part in our online survey and two-thirds of them backed the proposal, he said.We revised our plans to take account of those who had concerns, particularly businesses. We hope the new plans allay some fears and bring more people behind the initiative. This event is not about street drinking. It is about opening up the amount of space given to pedestrians.Kinsale has done it, Malahide has done it. We want the place to be like a Parisian street where people move around safely, enjoy each other#s company and support local businesses.SDLP councillor Gary McKeown said: This is a community-driven initiative to benefit the area from a bunch of erse residents. It#s a grassroots movement.It#s aimed at reducing traffic and supporting local businesses. I understand that some are for and some against. Consultation and engagement are essential. Nothing is being imposed. This is a conversation we are having. Nobody wants to go into this with bad blood and we are hoping for common ground.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much.

The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -year-old Irish International Driver of the Year and former Irish Young Driver of the Year touched down on Italian soil on Sunday for the next stage of his rally career. Devine took part in the Junior World Rally Championship in  and last season finished third in a stage of the European Championship in Hungary in the same Hyundai i R car he will be behind the wheel of this weekend. After Tuesdays testing day, Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy, spent Wednesday and Thursday carrying out recce of the course and making notes ahead of Fridays shake-down. googletag.cmd.push The event properly gets underway on Saturday which will see Callum and Brian tackle six stages before a further nine stages on Sunday conclude the event which spans just under km. “A lot of effort has been put in by Motorsport Ireland and the Rally Academy to making sure I was here,” Devine told the County Derry Post. “There is the support of Hyundai for me to make a championship assault, so there there is a lot of support being put into it. “It is a big step and I would say it is the biggest year for us. It is going to be our first year and we will be on the back foot. A lot of the drivers we are competing against are in their second or third season and have done this rally a few times.” googletag.cmd.push While Devine sees it as a learning year he realises the need to perform and has set his target to in the Junior R category. “The way it has always worked out in years before,you are fast enough in the juniors you are never that far away from the overall podium. “Chris Ingram, last year, was planning on winning the junior championship and he got beat on it by . of a second in the Czech Republic, he lost the junior championship but he went on to win the full European Championship.” Devine speaks of how the European Championship has lost a lot of momentum to the World Championship, but with Covid- forcing the cancellation of other events it will bring all the big hitters to Italy this weekend. “Craigand a lot of the guys who have been here before, there are lot of quick guys that are going to be going for the main championship. It was probably the strongest year in the European Championship for the last five or six years. There are a lot of quick drivers, but thats what you want,” Devine said. During his World Rally debut in , the Park man had two fourth places and a fth place finish. “We were second in Portugal and we had a DNF . In Corsica, we clipped a back wheel and went down, we were heading for the podium there,” he recalls. “It was one of those years, it didnt click for us. It was a big step, you learn a lot from it. At the time, there wasnt much support and you were left jumping into the unknown into the WRC and how much is involved in it outside of driving of the car, that was the biggest shock but at the same time we enjoyed it. “It was a challenging year and we are now back on the Europeanand are where we want to be.We want to race abroad and see how fast we can be.” Being named International Driver of the Year last season was a big shock for Devine, given the field of drivers in the hunt for the title. Apart from a gravel rally in Fivemiletown earlier this year, the sporting lockdown forced Callum into a dferent type of training. “I have been keeping fit, I got a bike,” he jokes. “I did a bit of running, I was in the forest and bought the bike and doing prep watching on-boards from the rallies and keeping myself fit and active.” He pays tribute to Motorsport Ireland and in particular John Coyne for getting another chance to dine at the top table. “He lives over in the Statesbut he is a great of Irish rallying. They have gave me a lot of help andit wasnt for them, I wouldnt be here.” For Devine, in his usual laid back conservation, its time to steer his way towards a podium spot.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The Department of Health which operates the local test centre and several others in Northern Ireland confirmed that the local testing centre will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The testing site at City of Derry Rugby Club will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. googletag.cmd.push “Work is underway on behalf of the National Testing Programme to identy an alternative site and an announcement will be made in due course. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. googletag.cmd.push It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Coronavirus pandemic has been tough on local businesses and news that Eason closed in Foyleside came as a blow to the city centre. There are however independent businesses who despite the current economic uncertainty are branching out and creating employment in the city. Much loved food truck and eatery Pyke ‘N’ Pommes revealed on social media that it is about to take over a new unit – at the old Primrose cafeacute on the Strand Road. googletag.cmd.push An exciting new project, BROslashN, has also been announced at recently vacated premises on Bishop Street which will house a coffee bar, barista school, restaurant and cocktail bar with locally sourced beer and spirits. Daragh McCauley is the owner of ine Hostages Coffee Company which is based at the top of Waterloo Street. He will run the new venture with business partner Connor Allen who has been manager at Harry’s Shack in Portstewart since it opened. ine Hostages started as a coffee van on the side of the road in Donegal before they opened the shop in Derry towards the end of . googletag.cmd.push “My dream was always to open a coffee shop,” Mr McCauley said. A refined menu at ine Hostages consists of grilled cheese toasties with a choice of good quality local meats and homemade ingredients as well as the best quality bread and baked goods. It was ‘slow going’ at the beginning but the pandemic came as a blow as the business was beginning to gain some traction. With a one-way system in operation they were able to successfully reopen once permission was granted. Mr McCauley believes the quality of coffee sourced from Bailies Coffee Roasters is second to none The most important ingredient is the ‘passion’  Hostages has for all of their products, he added. Anyone using Bailies products in the North West of the country will now be trained at the new Bishop Street premises. BROslashN will offer coffee and food throughout the day and sit-down meals in the evening complemented by craft beers and cocktails. They intend to support local as much as possible through suppliers and employing staff from the North West. “I’ve been working in coffee now for about four and a half years, I’m going to stay managing this shop but will work in BROslashN as well,” Mr McCauley explained. “We’re going to try and create as many jobs as we possibly can. About  people across both businesses. “The barista school will be opened upstairs on Bishop Street. “We’re hoping to open around August  and we’ll know this week whether that’s going to happen. “We’ve a lot of staff hired but are still looking for people with experience.” Mr McCauley said he feels confident opening the new business in the current climate because the people of Derry have done a good job of looking after each other and businesses have been sensible. “Derry has been really, really good so far and the way we will lay the shop out on Bishop Street it held about  people but we’ll be dropping it to  and the tables will be spaced out without losing the atmosphere. “It will be a cosy but modern shop and unless there was a complete lockdown again we’d be very confident with the way we have it laid out that it will work.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Father La rises in the morning at around .am for early morning Mass. Less than an hour later, he is under an open sky as birds fly overhead undertaking the Stations in his bare feet leaving solitary footprints where before many soles left their imprint on the earth. Housemartins A station takes around an hour and ten minutes to do and Father La does so under the swooping wings of the Housemartins amidst a backdrop of blooming nature during these calm but drizzly mornings. googletag.cmd.push At am, the boatmen come onto the island. Each day Thomas Gallagher from Ballyshannon, Reece McGrath from Pettigo and Joe Sheeran from Mountcharles arrive on the island and undertake their own work. They leave at pm. “Really, I can hardly remember the last time in my le I was lonely. I am at ease with my own company,” he said. As they leave the island, Father La is well into his day. “I would be hard pushed to find a time when I have been busier. “People are afraid that I am bored but I’m not. The team are exceptionally busy, they have been putting so much work into alternative ways to keep in touch with pilgrims. We have set ourselves to be in outreach mode,” he said. googletag.cmd.push In the evening, Father La goes up to the Basilica for night prayer. “My thoughts are to honour the rhythm of the pilgrimage season,” he says. This year, those affiliated with the island are busy in new and alternate ways. Father La said that many people have been sending petitions to those on the island: “We get a lot of people who send us petitions asking for prayer for this or that,” Father La said. In his prayers, he remains faithful to those people and the heartfelt petitions that they have undertaken to write and to send to the island. Virtuous pilgrimage On the last weekend in June, Father La invited people to do the full pilgrimage with him from wherever they were. It was not a virtual pilgrimage, he said, but a virtuous one and people did fast and pray asthey were on the island. People signed up online to participate. Father La recalls that the pilgrimage was one where they were not blessed with favourable weather. “The rain was horizontal. It was driving rain and constant wind. “It was relentless during the night. On Saturday we got through reasonably well,” he said. Those who participated were bestowed with a certicate which carries the Lough Derg seal and are signed by the prior. All of the certicates had to be sent out by the team to those who participated. A pilgrimage season did not take place on the island in  as result of a dispute with boatmen. However, many more pilgrims came to the island the following year. Pilgrimage path There is now a newly refurbished path on the lake shore of Lough Derg. The path which was recently relaunched would have been used by pilgrims in the medieval times. In the s pilgrims from as far away as Spain, Italy and Hungary used part of this trail as they made their way to what medieval Europe knew of as St Patrick’s Purgatory. Work was being carried out on the path before the pandemic struck and six new boards were designed and ready to go when the lockdown came into effect. There are now six display boards which bring to le the story of the Pilgrim Path and those who walk the path can enjoy stopping to read the boards. Father La said that the ‘full walk’ is around k along the shore road and to Saints Island. “We went to the point where pilgrims used to cross to Saint’s Monastery where they were given hospitality before being brought to Station Island,” he said. People can also take a shorter loop and everyone can do the walk at their own pace. Some people like to do it in soft contemplation and reflection whilst other people like to absorb the surroundings. Many people enjoy taking photographs in the historic and picturesque surroundings. “I led two guided groups on Saturday and Sunday,” he said. Numbers were limited as a result of the Covid- church and State guidelines, those who took part enjoyed it. One-day retreat Father La said that it remains to be seen whether a one-day retreat will take place on the island this year. “It remains to be seen whether we can open for a one-day retreat at this time,” he said. However, a meeting for the matter to be discussed will take place before the end of the week. August  It is expected that Father La will remain on the island until August . Enjoying his own company, reflection and prayer, Father La seems content during this year’s traditional pilgrimage time. He has now become familiar with a goose who comes onto the island to graze in the grass. The goose can be found behind St Mary’s, at times, and when startled will take off honking at great speeds, at times. His presence is one that the reflective priest appreciates. “I am kind of glad for his company. “It is amazing the company that God sends you when you are on your own,” he fondly says.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Back then, three Kevin Hinphey goals helped them to a - to - win over Lavey,  months after the Erins Own men beat them in the final to end their five-in-a-row hopes. In recent seasons, Hinphey has helped bring through a batch of underage that is feeding into the senior ranks. Former sharpshooter Geoffrey McGonigle is back for a third season as senior boss. Ronan McCloskey remains on the management team, where they are joined by Ryan ONeill who has coached Derry Us to back to back Celtic Challenge titles. googletag.cmd.push “We are the same as every other team, we had a pre-season done the that was kicked into touch, so you were basically starting from scratch,” ONeill pointed out. From last season, they have lost Corey OReilly who has moved to Canada, but many of their young guns are a year older. Padraig OKane scored a goal in last years win over Ballinascreen after being sprung from the bench. Sean and Conor Kelly join their older brother Paddy in the side. Brothers Richie and John Mullan, Odhraacuten McKeever and Tiarnaacuten McHugh have transformed into regulars. “There are a few boys pushing andCassidy has got himself cemented into the team after his first year last year. The county scene will have helped him and you have Darragh McGilligan coming in off the back of the Celtic Challenge and trying to push on,” ONeill added. googletag.cmd.push The Lynchs are assessing Mark Craigs Osteitis pubis injury, which has shown a bit of progress in recent weeks. There is also a doubt over Liam Oacuteg Hinphey, who would bring a wealth of experience to their defence, especiallyCraig fails to make it for the opening games. “We are putting no pressure on anybody,” ONeill added, while acknowledging the uncertainly surrounding the Covid- pandemic. Aiming their sights at Slaughtneil is for another day. For now it is about getting it back to a final. “It is like every year and all we can do is prepare for that first game against Swatragh and once that it out of the way, we will start pushing on for what we are looking for,” ONeill stressed. “Ideally, the goal will be to be in the county final and challenging whoever comes through the other side of the draw and I would be . percent sure it will be Slaughtneil.” For now, it is about finding a balance. Mark Craig is no longer part of Stephen ONeills football  and will be able to focus on his recovery. “It is a tight schedule for dual players and we have just been reasonable with them. If a man has trained or played a match, we need to ensure they rest,” Ryan ONeill points out. “We just cant send men to the slaughter. Our footballers will be doing their thing and we will be doing ours, it just about being sensible with the lads.” Swatragh are under the management of Declan McGuckin this season, after Eamonn Hasson stepped down to work commitments and has brought Seamus Bradley with him to the management team. The  champions have not reported any retirements since last season, but could be without regular full-back Malachaiacute Oacute hAgaacutein due to family commitments. “With the times that is in it, you cant be too forceful. He will be a massive loss, but thankfully Patrick Turner is back out again,” McGuckin pointed out. “Going by a lot of clubs, numbers are away back up again. We have  to , so things are very good so far. Its unbelievable what a pandemic can do to people and they realise it is good to get playing sport a day or two a week.” Swatragh took two games, including a run out against Cloughmills to get geared up for the championship with an eye on qualying for the senior semi-finals. “Banagher will be a big game for us. The Dungiven game wont define our year. We have the Coleraine game and then it is a winner takes all game with Banagher to get to the semi-final of the championship. If not, that junior championship becomes very competitive, which is good. At least there is competitive hurling. VERDICT: Kevin Lynchs RELATEDBanagher to open against Coleraine.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, where Limavady is situated, experienced the largest surge in cases, with an extra  since last Wednesday. A mobile testing unit, situated on the Greystone Road, was deployed to the area in response to the cluster. Only one more case was recorded in the Mid Ulster area, but Derry and Strabane saw fourteen new cases, bringing its total to . Ten local GAA clubs suspended activities as a precautionary measure in response to the cluster, with only St Mary’s GAC, Banagher, confirming a positive case within their members. googletag.cmd.push A club spokesperson said: “All relevant people have been contacted and the Public Health Agency will contact any club memberthey feel there is a concern. “We will keep you up to date of any information received from them. “The GAA has advised the club to continue as normal, although we have decided to cancel all underage training until further notice.” A shop in Claudy, part of the Derry and Strabane district, has also confirmed a member of its staff is currently in isolation after testing positive for Covid-. In a statement, posted online, Centra Claudy said other members of staff have volunteered for testing. googletag.cmd.push “Whilst we do have one staff member who has tested positive for Covid- they are in isolation since they had the test and are following public health advice,” they said. “The public health authority did not contact any of our other staff for testing via track  trace although some have volunteered for testing and all results to date have ed negative. “We can assure you that we have been following very strict Covid guidelines since we entered this pandemic in March. “Our staff have worked tirelessly to provide a service for the local area, and we have appreciated the support  patience from our community in following guidelines when shopping.” A ‘local lockdown’ have been enforced in Leicester, England, after a surge in positive cases, and the Department of Health said the strategy would be ‘considered’ in Northern Ireland. “With lockdown restrictions being eased it is likely that we will see clusters and outbreaks of Covid-,” a DoH spokesperson said. “In circumstances where the number of cases continues to increase a range of measures will be considered, including the introduction of local lockdownsnecessary and depending on the circumstances as they arise.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Caoimhe Archibald. East Derry MLA, Caoimhe Archibald, has urged people not to panic, saying the figures were proof the Test, Trace and Protect system was working. “It is concerning that a cluster has been identied, first and foremost for those iniduals who are affected,” she said. “Hopefully no one is suffering from serious symptoms and will recover quickly, but there is a general concern there in the local community and that’s understandable. “We don’t want people to be alarmed. We have seen the test, trace and isolate system in place, and we can see how that is working. “The cases have been identied and the process is rolling out. That is critical to containing the virus and we see those procedures working effectively. “It’s a timely reminder to us all that we can’t become complacent, that we do need to remain vigilant and practise public health guidance in terms of social distancing, good hygiene and cough etiquette.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A spokesperson for the club confirmed the news last night after a day of uncertainly regarding the potential fixture. Originally scheduled to face League of Ireland champions Dundalk, Celtic were expecting to welcome the Lilywhites to Celtic Park, but quarantine restrictions ended their hopes of playing the game with anyone coming into the Republic from the UK having to self isolate for  days. With the League of Ireland set to start next Friday, that would have been impossible for the champions. googletag.cmd.push That opened the door for Derry City to step into the glamour friendly, with reports suggesting that former Celtic and City star Paddy McCourt was heavily involved in organising the game. The hope was that, as Derry City would only be travelling to another part of the UK from Northern Ireland, they are not bound by the same restrictions. That hope continued into yesterday, with the club hoping to finalise arrangements for the game, but they were dashed by the FAI last night. With City set to travel to Dublin to face St. Patricks Athletic, just eight days after the proposed game in Scotland, the same -day rule which scuppered Dundalks plans, also appear to have stopped Derry, despite technically being in the UK. googletag.cmd.push Instead of Celtic, City hope to finalise their pre-season plans with a game against Northwest neighbours Finn Harps behind closed doors at the Brandywell tomorrow night. Declan Devines men faced Cltonville in midweek and drew -, with the City boss running his eye over three new trialists. The Candystyripes face Sligo Rovers in the resumption of the league season next Friday. Celtic, meanwhile, who now wont have Irish opposition this weekend, finished off their mini tour of France with a - defeat at French giants Paris St-German, with superstars Kylian Mbappe and Neymar both on the scoresheet in the Parc des Princes encounter.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fortunately, a fire, believed to have spread to undergrowth after an attempt was made to set a speed restriction sign alight, did not develop into a large blaze.The volunteers who run the railway mdash who have launched an urgent appeal to raise pound, mdash are particularly concerned about an attempt to force open the main gates they discovered empty beer cans. First aid boxes at the station were also raided for bandages.Damage at the Loop  was discovered during a recent shunt to test rolling stock and carry out essential track maintenance, with the exercise taking place while visitors were banned from the railway due to lockdown restrictions.Railway officials have reported the incidents to police and have appealed to anyone who can assist officers with their enquiries to come forward.The recent incidents come after the coronavirus lockdown had a massive hit on the railwayrsquos finances.In an online post, officials appealed to young people to ldquoleavethem alone and stop trying to destroy the place, also asking parents do they know where their children are and what they are doing.The hard-working volunteers say they have enough on their plate without having to ldquosort out other peoplersquos mess, expressing concern about people walking along the railway lines which they are not allowed to do.Officials say the ldquostupidity of others is the reason why they hope the local community will support their fundraising appeal to help pay for better security as a bid for financial help from the Northern Ireland Executive proved unsuccessful.A recent bid for support from the Department of Communitiesrsquo Covid- Charities Fund to cover costs racked up to maintain the business which has been mothballed due to lockdown restrictions was unsuccessful.Officials fear that the railway will also miss out on securing a slice of a poundm fund for business start-ups and tourist attraction investment which was announced recently.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner recently wrote an open letter highlighting the railwayrsquos plight and its reluctance to ask for help in the current financial climate.He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work.Mr Gardiner said the railway was likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid-.He said that with no income for the rest of the year, the railway faced ldquomajor challenges.Mr Gardiner said given that the railwayrsquos final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont failed, it had reluctantly turned to its members and supporters to ask for help.He added: ldquoWe need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.To date, the railwayrsquos appeal has raised pound,, with anyone interested in making a donation asked to visit www.facebook donate   or text RAIL plus the amount to  or visit www.downrail appeal.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Aarin’s lockdown farm project  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK boy has been enjoying lsquoThe Good Lersquo during the Covid- lockdown.Twelve year-old Aarin Rea has spent the past four months developing a miniature farm, complete with chickens, ducks, doves and even peacocks, in the garden of his Knochnashinna home.Hersquos also growing fruit and vegetables in his allotment and specially built greenhouse, and hersquos also planted apple trees.His family and neighbours will soon be able to share in an abundance of potatoes, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, scallions, broad beans, tomatoes, strawberries and apples, as well as a supply of fresh eggs.Aarinrsquos mum, Karin, says the miniature farm has helped bring the community together during the isolation of lockdown and has lted everyonersquos spirits.ldquoItrsquos all everyone has been talking about lately, she said. ldquoThey are always enquiring as to how the farm is coming along and Aarin couldnrsquot be any prouder at whathe has achieved over the last few months.ldquoAarin has been eager to get out every day to his little farm while he has been off school. He spent the good weather tending and watering his fruit vegetables both in the allotment and in the greenhouse, which his father, Anthony, built for him.Aarin is the proud owner of peacock chicks, which were hatched thanks to a tip from his grandfather, Leslie Rea, who told him to put golf balls underneath the peacocks to encourage them to lay eggs.Aarin, has since given his poultry flock some pretty ingenious names, and he now considers his ducks, James Pond and Quacky Chan, among some of his best friends.Then there are his favourite hens, Henner Lopez, Princess Laya and Fluffy, who are very happy to the strutting around.The newest arrivals are two doves, Holy and Spirit, which are housed in a newly-built dovecote and a turkey chick.However, Aarinrsquos favourite animal is his beloved Jack Russell, Lottie.Aarinrsquos farming skills have come a long way since be began growing potatoes in tubs.ldquoI sell my duck eggs to elderly neighbours who adore their distinct flavour. Our next door neighbour, Tommy Armour, is always giving me little bits of advice to help bring the brood along.

I much prefer spending my time tending to my fruit and vegetables and caring for my new chicks.ldquoSometime my little sister, Grace, helps me. She is nine years old and is learning a lot more about farming than I ever thought she would.Aarin added: ldquoI thought the good weather during lockdown helped my vegetables grow.

That is absolutely essential.Campaigners added: ldquoThe historic underinvestment in the Ambulance Service has been widely known for years.

If there had have been, the guide would have stopped and taken him down.Jules was later told by the Matterhorn Museum that itrsquos believed he was the youngest person ever to have mastered the peak.Chris, now living with his family in the Scottish Highlands where he and his we Mignonne run a gin distillery, Daffyrsquos, said: ldquoJules has always loved climbing since he was able to walk.

He was always very capable as we have always climbed as a family.Chris said that Jules continued to put the work into building up his skills and stamina for the climb mdash even the Covid- could not defeat the  year-oldrsquos determination to climb the mountain.ldquoWe had lined up an American friend of ours to guide us, but he couldnrsquot travel due to the pandemic so we thought we would go with the local mountain guides.ldquoHowever, they told Jules that he couldnrsquot do it until he was  and after he proved himself.

He thought it was incredible but it did take a while for it to sink in afterwards.While Jules may be eligible for an entry into the Guinness Book of Records, his dad said that accolade is not what Jules was about.ldquoHersquos not a glory hunter in any sense, hersquos just appreciative and proud to have done it.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it. We have consistently argued that the mercury issue is a red herring and nothing we have seen or heard has made us deviate from this position.ldquoSt Johnrsquos is one of the best ventilated lighthouses of its kind and we are opposed to any orce from the current Fresnel lens and its Burdel rotating mechanism.Campaigners say they hope that politicians will seek an urgent, virtual meeting with CIL to ask why their wishes have been ignored and why they were not formally told that the tendering process had begun.The campaign spokeswoman added: ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse boasts what is widely regarded as a rare bit of engineering excellence which we want retained and maintained. The iconic sweeping beam and rotation system must not be lost at the stroke of a pen and consigned to the pages of history.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs. One possibility is that the facade of the current building would be retained, with a new-build at the rear.Council officials say that any plan to redevelop the Central Promenade site will not impact on any part of the promenade at the rear of the building.They insist that they are committed to the Newcastle project and recognise that it has a key role to play, meeting the needs of local people and visitors alike, particularly during inclement weather.It has also been confirmed that local people are to be asked for their views on redeveloping the site as part of a pre-planning application process, to come up with a favourable design.Senior council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.

Much better first to upgrade the A east of Stranraer. Above is a part of the road that was upgraded to bypass the village of Dunragit, but the overwhelming bulk of the -mile road to England is single carriageway, in which traffic can get stuck behind tractorsIt was mid - financial slump, and all sorts of businesses were struggling. Private transport services were being cut.My concern was that the PO fast ferry from Larne to Cairnryan, which had just begun for the  summer season, might not survive.It needed support, I wrote. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Sure enough, within years the fast ferry was withdrawn .Axing the Larne-Cairnryan fast boat was a sad milestone in the history of movement on these islands.It was the fastest passenger sea link that has ever existed between Ireland and Great Britain, making the journey in an hour. Even the Belfast-Stranraer Seacat express of the s took  minutes.Travel does not always get faster as history progresses. After the Roman empire collapsed, roads in Europe decayed.When Concorde stopped flying in , the public could no longer make transatlantic crossings on passenger planes in just four hours. And since PO ceased running the fast ferry, it has not been possible to cross the Irish Sea or North Channel in one hour on any scheduled, car-carrying vessel. It might never be possible again.This is all the more disappointing given that there is now dual carriageway or motorway the whole distance from Belfast to Larne.The road was upgraded because it forms part of European E route, from Larne to Rosslare. In fact, most of the road between those two ports is now motorway or high quality dual. Yet the ports themselves have lost key ferry services.This is all relevant now because Boris Johnson has approved a feasibility study into his idea of a bridge from Northern Ireland to Scotland.The idea has many critics, who describe it as a fantasy, yet engineers have said it can be built.But last year there was surprise, even scoffing, when I predicted on a radio discussion show that it would not happen for  years at the very earliest.Some people alive today might see such a structure, but that is mainly because children in  might live into the  century.There are longer bridges in the world than the  miles from Donaghadee to Portpatrick but none passes over a , foot trench.So it would be the most impressive bridge in the world. If any country can build it, the UK, which was once an infrastructure pioneer, and which is the world’s sixth richest nation, can.The problem is that traffic between NI and Scotland is minuscule by international standards.In summer  I passed through the Channel Tunnel, months after it opened, and remember the passenger excitement as our train went from Kent countryside into the tunnel, then emerged into French daylight. That massive triumph of engineering was the culmination of  years of plans for a physical link between England and France.It also connected two cities of almost  million people each, London-Paris, on one of the world’s busiest corridors. NI-Scotland is nowhere near such numbers.A bridge would be doing well to get , vehicles a day paying £ each per crossing, and even then the £+ million annual revenue might only cover the immense security and upkeep costs, let alone giveon the multi billion pound outlay cost.The short-term feasibility of a bridge is akin to unrealistic calls for high speed rail from Belfast to Londonderry, cities of , and , respectively.Not even France, with the best rail infrastructure in the world, has high speed link between two far bigger cities that I have often visited, Bordeaux-Toulouse, which are a mere  miles apart with a combined population of  million.It is unfair to dismiss a bridge to Scotland as a fantasy, better to label it as a distant dream.It cannot be, as Mr Johnson hopes, a boost to the Union because we can’t be sure of the exact constitutional make-up of these islands many decades into the future.As a letter writer says opposite , there are less costly infrastructure projects we need to do first such as improve the road from Stranrarer Cairnryan toM English border.Even that is a hugely expensive project for a road with low traffic levels. But parts of it, such a busier -mile section east of Dumfries, could plausibly be dualled.The value of such an upgrade is evident in an alternative road route to England, the A from Holyhead to the Welsh mainland. I have driven Belfast-London many times since the s and have seen how the best route has changed from being via Stranraer to via Holyhead.This is due to there now being a motorway to Dublin, including a tunnel that goes direct to the port. Then there is dual carriageway or motorway in Wales, so you no longer get stuck behind tractors in Anglesey, as you still do in Galloway.Theof a one-hour fast ferry from Larne to Cairnryan and the upgrade of much of the A would radically improve our links to Scotland and be many, many times cheaper than a bridge.Mr Johnson must know that the Union faces real political threats. One of the dangers right now is the rise in Scottish nationalism.In Northern Ireland, unionists face structural disadvantages.For example, mandatory coalition at Stormont facilitates republicans who want NI to fail. Politicians who are less hostile to the status quo tend to want to maintain their seats and livelihoods. Naturally they are inclined to appease the radicals.London should also try to balance a situation in which Dublin officials echo nationalist demands while the UK keeps sending us uninformed secretaries of state, who are influenced by an NIO that is, at best, neutral on unionism.These are urgent problems for the Union. Vague support for a possible future bridge is irrelevant to those challenges.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Letter: Scottish and UK governments have failed to upgrade the roads from Cairnyan——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The party made constraints on ministers one of its centre-piece demands for the restoration of Stormont, yet now, under a dferent leadership, it is helping to push through legislation that will remove those constraintsThis bill, which has been rushed through the assembly in a matter of weeks and has to date received little or no legislative scrutiny, will fundamentally affect decision-making in Northern Ireland.From the public comment on the bill, there is no appreciation of the implications of some of the proposed changes. Instead,MLAs are sleepwalking into making profound constitutional amendments. Twenty years ago ministers enjoyed considerable autonomy in relation to decisions within their department and famously the then minister for education abolished the eleven plus exam on his last day in office without recourse to the executive.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Richard Bullick, a former barrister, was special advisor to Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster as first ministerAllowing ministers such power within their departmental remits did not sit well with democratic accountability or joined up government and the DUP made the reform of these arrangements a centre-piece of its terms for the restoration of devolution. Admittedly, there was also a signicant element of being able to limit the capacity of Sinn Fein ministers to pursue their political and constitutional agenda. In a  policy document, the party argued that legislation “would be required to ensure that ultimate power would rest with the executive as opposed to the inidual departments”. To be clear the DUP’s intention was to ensure that any important decision could be required to secure executive approval and the resulting provisions meant that unionistconsent was required. The provisions that were legislated for were complex and interlocking. The underlying objective was achieved in two carefully worded statutory tests for which decisions would require executive approval. These arrangements operated successfully from  and on only a few occasions did DUP ministers feel compelled to go to court to successfully enforce the arrangements the party had largely devised. The rationale for the present bill arises out of a Court of Appeal decision to the effect that a signicant planning application required executive approval. Understandably, the executive wished to bring forward an amendment to recty that situation, but more controversially it has also chosen to amend a provision relating the carefully calibrated tests for executive approval more generally. There is little evidence that the drafters of the objectionable clauses of the bill were informed of the purpose of the original provisions. As a result the proposed changes seriously undermine the DUP’s claim to have a veto on all important decisions in NI. The essential purpose of the amendment is to redefine a test for full executive consideration in a way which would increase ministerial autonomy. This was done by limiting the meaning of what constitutes a ‘cross-cutting’ matter, reducing the range of decisions that have to come to the executive. Why then are DUP the appearing to be reversing a long-standing policy  My view is that it is not a change of policy but flows from misconceptions in what is a complex area of law.Firstly, there is a custom and practice argument which asserts that the new clause reflects the sort of matters that actually come before the executive for decision. While this may be true, it also entirely misses the point. The real issue is not what normally comes to the executive, but what can be required to come where other ministers take exception to a proposed decision.Secondly, there is the argument that the legislation restores the test for what constitutes cross-cutting to the standard which existed before the Buick decision , but after the changes brought about by the  St Andrews Agreement. The new test for cross-cutting would mean that there would be no requirement for executive agreement, “unless that matter affects the exercise of the statutory responsibilities of one or more other ministers more than incidentally”. Notably, there is no mention of ‘statutory’ responsibilities in paragraph  of the Belfast Agreement. This distinction has signicant application for s where there is no statutory underpinning for what departments do in practice. Even more signicantly the “more than incidentally” requirement, above, is demonstrably a greater level of “cross-cutting” than requirements which have already been found to satisfy the statute by the courts. These include reference to, “touches on” JR  “issues arise in a multitude of less obvious circumstances” Central Craigavon, “engages the responsibility of ious Ministers” Minister for Enterprise Trade and Investment.Self-evidently,the intention of the new clause had been to reflect previous case law, then the language in those judgments could have been deployed for statutory purposes. It was not. Thirdly, misplaced comfort may be taken by what is known as the ‘signicant or controversial’ test, though this simplication ignores a crucial second limb of the provision, which also requires the decision to be ‘clearly outside the scope of the agreed programme’ for government. The boundaries of this limitation are unclear, though unambiguously it weakens the short-hand catch-all test. And fourthly, it has been suggested, both at the Executive Office Committee and in the assembly, that the so-called ‘three minister call in’ provision in the legislation provides an ultimate safety net. This provision, it is said, would allow any three ministers to require a matter to come to the executive and deprive the minister of the authority to take such a decision .As the argument goes, there being four DUP ministers, this provides the needed assurance for unionists fearful of republican ministers going on ‘solo runs’. The logic of this argument is impeccable but for one rather fundamental defect. No such provision exists.This regrettable conclusion is reached, not by recourse to case law or obtuse statutory interpretation, but by a simple Google search of the relevant legislation, namely ‘section  Northern Ireland Act ’. As this safeguard has been widely cited in aid of the new provision, it is safe to assume that the entire bill is predicated upon this mistaken assumption. This is not a solid foundation for constitutional legislation. Problematically for the movers of the bill is that fact that they have to convince assembly members that the legislation, with the amendment, means exactly the same as the legislation did without it. The only intervening event was a judgment by lord chief justice where he interpreted the statute consistent with the approach the DUP have always advocated.All is not yet lost. Doug Beattie MLA has put down amendments to remove the dangerous aspects of the bill, while leaving in place the sensible provisions. These should be supported leaving the contentious aspect the bill to another day.

If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A youth Assembly is a fantastic setting to encourage debate and allow our young people to opportunity to hold their elected representatives to account. They must not be weary of pursuing their own agenda and really making their mark on the issues that matter to them.“Over the coming two year period the Alliance Party is looking forward to engaging further with the Youth Assembly and we hope to see an inclusive body, reflective of our society today.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
