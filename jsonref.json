More than four million are ordering more takeaways while they are shut out of pubs and restaurants.The increase in drinking has appeared alongside more sleep as hangovers have gone uninterrupted by the need to get up and go to work. Four out of ten people say they have been sleeping more since late March – on average by four hours and 22 minutes a week.There has also been an increase in Britons intending to leave alcohol alone once lockdown is over. A high proportion promises to cut down on drinking, unhealthy eating and takeaways – and do more exercise.The survey, for Direct Line Life Insurance, was carried out by Opinium among 2,000 people in late April. Chloe Cooper, of Direct Line, said: ‘Lockdown has been extremely challenging for many people, with most facing radical changes to their work and home life.‘Although it can be easy to go to the kitchen and grab an unhealthy snack or pour an alcoholic drink, it is important to remember the importance of a balanced lifestyle.‘In such an uncertain time, where health and wellness is at the front of everyone’s mind, looking after yourself and your family is crucial.’"},{"url":null,"title":"University students live course bubbles hold virtual freshers weeks","story":"Share this articleUniversities redesign campuses for social distancing and put students in protective \u0027bubbles\u0027 to deal with \u0027biggest crisis ever\u0027 | inews"},{"url":null,"title":"Brewers stock record amounts beer pubs reopen weeks","story":"Share this articleBreweries WILL deliver 250 million pints to pubs for June 15 - fuelling hopes they could reopen by the end of the month"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2044da140e84d0fbcda537c9453465806870d24/0_1622_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=012ecffc7183eeee95c1e3b5b48ee68b","title":"from gourmet takeaways to feeding a zoo how a scottish pub adapted to lockdown","story":"As the owner of East Lothian gastropub the Mercat Grill, Graham Blaikie has had to adapt his business to survive. Here, he tells Sophie Goddard how he’s keeping not only his pub afloat, but is helping out the people – and animals – around him, too ...For thousands of small business owners, the global pandemic has flung their futures – and those of their staff – into uncertainty. That’s certainly true for Graham Blaikie, and his pub the Mercat Grill in Whitecraig, Scotland. “I’d been watching the news about Covid-19 since December and luckily we’d prepared,” he explains. “Even before we closed, we had contactless hand sanitisers and I was always wiping down handles and menus. I’d also removed items from tables, so there weren’t as many touch points.” But when Boris Johnson’s March announcement saw pubs and restaurants close to the public, the business that had taken Blaikie nine years to build was suddenly forced to adapt for survival.The first step was ensuring customers could still enjoy the food they loved. “Prior to the shutdown, we’d been talking about what our strategy would be – I bought containers and had our takeaway menu prepped, so we were ahead of the game”, he says of being ready for business the next day. “We had a lot of fresh food in the pub, so on the Saturday we started the takeaway system.” But it wasn’t without its problems. “It’s not as easy as you think doing takeaway food, especially restaurant-style. When people order with us they’re having haggis cigars, patties, fish and chips, pepper beef with rice and my mum’s desserts ... that’s six different containers at least. We spent about £2,000 on takeaway boxes initially, that’s a lot of money. But it’s hopefully keeping us going.”With the government support package now in place – and extended until October – Blaikie has turned his attention to helping local people. Launching his Soup(er) Hero campaign in April, he is now making soup and sandwiches for those in need. With help from the community council, a community hub – where food is dropped off and distributed by local volunteers – was born. The feedback keeps him going. “There’s an older couple and the wife’s got cancer and every day they get their soup and sandwich,” he says. “They have the soup at 12 o’clock, then the man drives his wife to the hospital for her treatment and when they come back, they enjoy the sandwich. That’s what makes it worthwhile.”It’s not just people benefiting, either – residents of Edinburgh zoo are also tucking into the pub’s surplus wares. “I had a massive box of bananas left over and my mum said: ‘You should take this to the zoo.’ So I got hold of all my leftover fruit and knocked on the zoo door – and that’s been it ever since.” Now Blaikie’s weekly deliveries of fruit, vegetables and fish help to feed the animals at a time when visitors – the zoo’s main form of income – have come to a standstill. “You’d probably choose not to eat some of the bananas, for example, because they don’t look as good, but they’re perfectly fine for the animals. When we’re making sandwiches, not everybody likes the heels of the bread either, so I freeze them and take them along – nothing’s getting wasted. And if I see something for a good price at the wholesalers – apples, cabbages, broccoli - I’ll pick that up, too. We need to keep zoos going, they’re all under a lot of pressure.”While it’s difficult to ascertain when exactly businesses such as Blaikie’s will open again, for now, he is focusing on adapting the way they work to ensure business is possible. “We have an isolated table in the front vestibule area, so people can come in and collect food safely, using contactless on the card machines for takeaways. We have separate areas for drivers to sit in too, so we’re doing everything we can.” And plans are already afoot for when pubs are finally allowed to reopen. “I’m looking at adding an area to the outside, so people can sit there the whole year round and I’m hoping to put in a little microbrewerydistillery, so I could eventually make hand sanitiser further down the line.”Why focus on helping others when keeping his own business afloat requires such effort? “I believe in helping people. I know this virus is a horrible thing, but it’s bringing out a lot of good in people as well. Neighbours are looking after neighbours, people are helping others with shopping or taking dogs for a walk. For so long, I didn’t like the way the world was going ...”What does Blaikie hope will come out of this situation? He pauses, then says: “That people start to work together a bit more, being more thoughtful of what’s going on around them. And of course, that they come to the Mercat for a meal.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

But thanks to safety measures put in place, a branch of David Abrahamovitch’s coffee chain is welcoming back happy customers and staffFor David Abrahamovitch, founder of cult coffee brand Grind, the decision to close his London-based food, coffee and cocktail bars was a painful one – and the decision to reopen one branch as a takeaway outlet on 20 May took even more careful planning.Abrahamovitch’s business journey started in 2011, when he inherited his father’s company. “I was 25 when I sadly lost my dad and inherited the family’s mobile phone business,” he says. “I had to decide what to do next – are we going to continue, are we going to close? I’d spent a lot of time in the shop as a teenager, helping out behind the counter, so it was very sentimental for me. I decided I wanted to keep the building and turn it into some kind of meeting place.”Converting the Old Street premises into a coffee shop, Abrahamovitch set about growing his business based on the cafes he’d visited on his travels. “I’d seen the independent cafe scene in other countries, and back then it just didn’t feel like it had been fully translated to the UK,” he says.“I wanted to recreate that Australian-style flat-white culture, with high-quality coffee beans, the best equipment, and amazing baristas who serve cups of coffee somewhere fun, lively and energetic. And I wanted to mix that with what the coffee chains do so well: good hygiene, mobile ordering and payment options and, most importantly, speedy service. A year later, we added cocktails when we realised our coffee made amazing espresso martinis!”Over the next nine years Abrahamovitch rolled his business out, spreading to 11 locations with 300 members of staff, serving sit-down breakfasts, lunch and dinner alongside coffee and cocktails. Grind also has an online business selling compostable coffee pods in refillable tins.When coronavirus reached the UK, Abrahamovitch’s business was sent into turmoil. “I’ve lived and bled this company for almost 10 years, and built it piece by piece, so finally getting to the point where we have tens of thousands of customers each week, then suddenly having to close was awful,” he says. “I remember the week of lockdown vividly. For a couple of weeks beforehand, we’d already seen sales start to fall away. We monitor sales to the hour, so when things start to drop off, you really notice it.“Then, when Boris Johnson told people they shouldn’t visit restaurants and bars, it was clear to us it was time to close. We shut all our stores, keeping just three open for takeaway to serve the local community for a few more days. When full lockdown was announced, we decided to close completely to protect our staff.”In the weeks since lockdown began, significantly more has been learned about the spread of Covid-19, and on 10 May the government announced certain businesses could reopen, with stringent safety rules in place. Guidance on how bosses can protect their workers, and how staff can safely travel into work, was drawn up. So now, companies such as Grind are taking tentative steps towards getting back to business, and on 20 May, its Greenwich outlet reopened its doors for grab-and-go coffees.Since plans to reopen were made, the safety of both staff and customers has been paramount. Grind works with a food hygiene company that has helped Abrahamovitch stay on top of the new government guidelines on safety and hygiene. “I think we’re all in a testing phase and figuring this out at the moment, but we’ve taken the steps we think are sensible without filling the place with yellow tape,” he says.“Only a couple of people are allowed inside the shop at any one time. Staff wear gloves, and at the tills there are big plastic screens separating them from customers – we haven’t made the wearing of masks mandatory, but they’re available if staff would like to use one.“We also have signs in the windows asking people to observe social distancing, stickers on the floor indicating what a two-metre gap looks like, and a hand sanitising station. It’s slightly odd having these things everywhere, but it seems to be working so far. I think people have got used to that kind of process in the last few weeks.”As well as coffee, the store is selling fresh bread, eggs and avocados, in lieu of breakfast. “We weren’t selling those things before, but we have great suppliers who make amazing bread and send us amazing eggs,” he says. “If we can help them and sell a few more products ourselves too, it makes sense. When you’ve suddenly got a daily bread delivery, it feels like you’re getting the wheels turning again.”Abrahamovitch took the inidual needs of his staff into careful consideration, making decisions based on the government’s advice, along with his own sense of duty to worried workers. On reopening Greenwich Grind, he took the simple step of asking which of his staff would be keen to return to work.“Everyone who wanted to be furloughed has been furloughed,” he says. “We haven’t laid anyone off as a result of this crisis, which helps me sleep better at night. Of those who volunteered to come back to Greenwich Grind, we selected those who live very close to the store, so there’s no need for them to get public transport into work. Lots of our staff walk or cycle in anyway, so if someone wants to come back, and lives close to a store we’re reopening, that’s a good fit.”Abrahamovitch hopes these measures will prove successful, and will lay the foundations for further, tentative reopenings. “We’re certainly expecting to learn a lot from this reopening,” he says. “At a lot of our sites, social distancing isn’t actually the biggest issue – for example, our London Bridge site relies on customers who work in the offices in the area, and the tourists who come to visit Borough Market at the weekend. Until they’re back, it’s going to be hard for us to reopen, but I hope to reopen one or two more branches in the next couple of weeks.”Abrahamovitch’s customers and staff are especially pleased by this step on the way to resuming business. “One of my staff texted me on the first day of reopening and said: ‘I’m so happy to be back and not just sitting in my living room. It’s been amazing.’ So that was pretty nice,” he says. “Our customers are thrilled, too – I was there the day before we opened, checking the safety measures for myself, and people were knocking on the door hoping to get inside early.“For me, as a customer, every time a place reopens I’m really happy. I think: ‘Great, I’ve got somewhere else to go, different people to meet, some different walls to look at.’ It’s definitely the same for our customers. They’re very pleased to have us back.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

But the chief reason was the unseasonably sunny spring weather, said Roisin Quinn, head of National Grid’s control centre.This spring was the sunniest since records began in 1929, according to the Met Office, and the driest May for 124 years. The Met Office recorded more than 573 hours of sunshine between 1 March and 27 May, beating the previous record of 555.3 hours in 1948.“Great Britain’s incredible coal-free run has continued throughout May, giving us the first full calendar month – 744 straight hours – of electricity generation without coal since the Industrial Revolution,” Quinn said.The combination of record low demand for electricity and near-record highs for renewable energy output is a “unique challenge” for the National Grid’s control room, Quinn said, because engineers had to make sure that the rise of renewable energy did not overload the grid.National Grid’s energy system operator arm expects to spend £500m more than usual this summer because it will need to pay generators to turn off their wind farms, solar projects or power plants.Over the last bank holiday weekend alone the company reportedly paid £50m to electricity generators to turn down their supplies, on top of a £50m contract offered to the Sizewell B nuclear plant to run at half capacity this summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d7420c017165c270aaa920a05271252c3c66bc/0_87_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=127e7d8f79cf0cb4df7815c9ce96beb6","title":"uk high street reopen lockdown john lewis primark halfords","story":"Chains including John Lewis, Primark and Halfords to open some stores as lockdown easesMany non-essential shopping chains are preparing to let customers back into stores as the Covid-19 lockdown eases.Outdoor non-food markets and car showrooms were allowed to reopen from Monday 1 June.

At the time, the prime minister urged countries to pull together and share their expertise. Yet if his government’s actions are anything to go by, it seems more interested in siding with big pharmaceutical corporations than turning vaccine research into a genuinely collective endeavour.The last straw came on Friday, when the government refused to support a World Health Organization initiative to encourage countries to share research on coronavirus treatments and produce any final medicines patent-free. This would mean they could be distributed fairly according to need.\u0026nbspThe proposal, a voluntary scheme that would pool knowledge, intellectual property and data about coronavirus health technologies, is not particularly radical – but you wouldn’t guess that from the recent protestations of pharmaceutical corporations.Pfizer called the proposal “nonsense”, while the big British companies working on coronavirus treatments, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKlein, refused to participate. When asked whether he would attend the launch of the WHO proposal, Thomas B Cueni, the director of the International Federation of Phamaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, a lobbying group, said he was “too busy”.The reaction from this industry shouldn’t surprise us. Over the past three decades, big pharma has used its unparalleled lobbying muscle to secure market monopolies that vastly increase the power it holds over governments. Thanks to trade rules known as Trips (trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights) that were developed in the 90s to enforce minimum patent standards around the world, these corporations enjoy monopoly protection for new medicines they manufacture, allowing them to charge any price the market will endure.These rules provide little incentive to produce the medicines desperately needed to treat illnesses common in low-income countries, such as sleeping sickness and cholera, but rather promote a narrow focus on drugs that mitigate chronic conditions common in the west, such as statins to treat high cholesterol. With chronic conditions, big pharmaceutical companies can sell the same medicines to the same patients for years, or even decades. Vaccines – designed to prevent diseases\u0026nbsp– are often used only once, and therefore don’t tend to be as profitable.Governments have poured phenomenal sums of money into drug development to stimulate essential medical research that patents have failed to incentivise. But this money – like the UK government’s £500m of coronavirus research funding – rarely comes with any strings attached, allowing pharmaceutical companies to monopolise the resulting medicines. A recent study estimated that one contender for a coronavirus treatment, a hepatitis C medication produced by the pharma giant Gilead, costs $5 per course to produce. The academics who authored the study said the drug is currently on sale in the US for more than $18,000 per treatment course.Despite the fact coronavirus medicines will be discovered using vast sums of public money, the NHS may still have to pay through the nose for any final product, while poorer countries could be unable to access the drug. It wouldn’t be the first time this has happened. In the 90s, millions died unnecessarily in the Aids crisis in sub-Saharan Africa, because the medicines to treat HIV were out of reach of most people.\u0026nbspThe WHO’s initiative launched on Friday is intended to avert a repeat of this. Many countries, rich and poor, support it – including Argentina, Mexico, South Africa, Norway, Portugal and Belgium. But for the British government, the patent system is sacrosanct. The UK seems desperate not to upset its own pharmaceutical corporations or the financial sector that makes substantial returns from these companies, which spend more money on share buybacks than on researching drugs.Two weeks ago, British officials attempted to water down a resolution at the World Health Assembly to create a global “patent pool”, which would have encouraged the production of patent-free coronavirus drugs. Then, on Friday, they declined to support the new WHO initiative for pooling research. Given the base of big pharma in the US and the UK, the withholding of support by industry and governments in these countries could easily scupper the WHO’s plans.\u0026nbspAt that point it will be up to inidual governments to use their power to override corporate patents. Nations including Germany, Canada, Chile, Israel and Ecuador have expressed their willingness to do so. This is perfectly legal, although big pharmaceutical companies might hope to convince us otherwise.\u0026nbspThere’s reason to believe that the British government has misjudged the public mood significantly. Recent polling in Britain and the US shows public support for making coronavirus medicines available internationally based on need, rather than ability to pay. And pharmaceutical companies have been careful to appear sympathetic to the need for “fair and equal access” to coronavirus treatments. Some, like AstraZeneca, have even pledged to supply vaccines at “cost price” during the pandemic. But with big pharma, each word needs to be carefully interrogated. As these companies have admitted, such pledges will have limited impact on the corporation’s profits because of vast public coronavirus subsidies.\u0026nbspWhen it comes to the crunch, pharmaceutical companies treat healthcare as a commodity, not a right. If anything good comes of coronavirus, we may hope that\u0026nbspit deepens the public understanding of the system’s failures, allowing us to build a genuinely public system of medical research and development. The WHO initiative could be the first step in that direction.\u0026nbsp• Nick Dearden is director of Global Justice Now (formerly World Development Movement)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef0f9dd247504761eed22f6308baa14ff7f8049d/0_217_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a25b8f0aa3522a214bc2df9e88f094f5","title":"mps back westminster government parliament","story":"Abolishing the virtual system means not only ‘conga line’ queues to vote – up to 250 MPs will be excluded altogetherThe virtual parliament is no more. The government has whipped its MPs to junk a series of innovations introduced in April to allow MPs to work remotely in favour of socially distant business as usual. Instead of virtual voting, MPs will be summoned back to Westminster.Colleagues who are shielding or unable to travel to London will now be excluded from participating in parliamentary proceedings. As many as 250 MPs who are vulnerable or who have caring responsibilities face a stark choice – between risking their lives or those of their loved ones and being unable to represent their constituents. The main justification given by the government for abolishing hybrid sittings was that MPs could not do their job from their constituencies because they were not able to spontaneously intervene in their colleagues’ speeches. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the house, argued this meant the quality of debate was reduced. While it is true that interventions enliven debate in the Commons in a way that sets it apart from other legislatures, their absence seems a small price to pay for enabling all elected members to participate.Before the May bank holiday recess, the government decided to reinstate the requirement of MPs to be physically present in parliament, and bring to an end the new ways of working that house authorities had moved heaven and earth to put in place in just a few weeks.\u0026nbspAt the time the government hoped that MPs would be able to return to voting in person by walking into the aye and no lobbies in the usual way.But last week the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, acting on advice from Public Health England, said that he would not allow voting in the lobbies and asked the government to find a new solution. That was when the government came up with the idea of a conga line of socially distanced MPs stretching through the Palace of Westminster, waiting to walk through the chamber to vote. This is a solution that has none of the supposed advantages of voting in person – such as being able to catch a minister for a word on behalf of a constituent. And many disadvantages, which were painfully apparent in today’s first new-style votes – as the conga line of MPs snaked for miles through the parliamentary estate making social distancing impossible.For many MPs, standing in line for hours waiting to vote will be their main experience of participating in the restored in-person Commons, because of all the MPs who can travel to Westminster, only 50 will be able to participate at any one time in the chamber. In order to maintain social distancing, the rest will have to watch from their offices until a vote is called. Each vote will take around half an hour – twice as long as a remote ision used to take.It may be that MPs get so tired of the palaver of queuing to cast their votes that they do all they can to minimise the number of votes that are held. A backbencher deciding whether to push an amendment to a vote will weigh carefully whether to incur the ire of her colleagues by making them traipse around the palace again. Of course fewer votes will not trouble the government but reducing opportunities to test the will of the house will be bad for scrutiny.Another reason that the government wanted the virtual parliament abolished was that it feared it would restrict its ability to pass as much legislation as it wanted. Early hybrid sittings in the chamber were limited in duration because of the requirements of the broadcasting technology, and there were concerns about whether there would be sufficient capacity to hold public bill committees\u0026nbsponline. The government rejected solutions to both these issues offered by the house authorities before it took the decision to abolish virtual sittings.Many MPs did not back the move. The procedure committee – the normal origin of sound and sensible proposals about how the Commons should run itself – put forward amendments to the government’s proposals that would have seen virtual participation and remote voting continue. These were backed by 16 select committee chairs, but rejected by the government.The government betrays its narrow and expedient view of the role of parliament when it seeks to reassure those MPs unable to travel to Westminster that it is working to find a way that their votes can be counted. Not only would proxy voting or mass pairing (where one MP abstains to cancel out the absent vote of another who would have voted the opposite way) hand significant power to the party whips, but also absent MPs would be unable to participate in debates on legislation.Rees-Mogg wrote yesterday that “Westminster has been the seat of our democracy for centuries. It will take more than coronavirus to change that.” Apparently a government careless of the right of all MPs to vote on behalf of their constituents is sufficient.• Hannah White is deputy director of the Institute for Government and was a House of Commons clerk between 2004 and 2014"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec0966aca9d9a6864275ddd8ec580696d29985b4/882_409_3962_2377/master/3962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c88ae227f455eeebb8b36aa7009c2a6","title":"safe ease lockdown matt hancock alert system britain","story":"Right now, Britain is about as biosecure as the health secretary is convincing.

Maybe “Government asks shielders to help them lift a sofa into the back of a van”. “Government waves from storm drain at shielders looking for their paper boats”. “Government responds to shielders saying ‘Dominic Cummings’ into a mirror three times”. “Government asks shielders to check in at a family-run motel”. “Government asks shielders to engage a 1980s Wall Street bro to take care of any household repairstree surgery they’ve been putting off during lockdown. Contractor will provide own nailgun and chainsaw.”I’ve no time for this theory that the government doesn’t care about having the worst death toll in Europe, based on the fact that they only robotically acknowledge it once a day by confirming how many people “have sadly died”. They do care, but just slightly shy of the amount required to tell a civil servant to visit\u0026nbspthesaurus. The repeat formulation gives the impression of being governed by a Grammarly template, or perhaps an automated phone system. “You are currently number –”\u0026nbsp“SADLY” “– in the queue.”On Sunday, it was Robert Jenrick’s turn on the sadface, with the housing and communities secretary released briefly for the press conference. He normally lives in a stock photo about online banking. Unfortunately, that environment seems not to have prepared Robert for questions about why the government is easing lockdown when they themselves said they would not do so until the official alert level was 3. “The alert level is changing,” Jenrick handwaved. “We are still at level 4 but we are transitioning to 3.” Is this like when I still haven’t done the ironing but I am transitioning to having done it? Have I, at that moment, done the ironing? No. Of course I haven’t. But I WILL have. Scientifically, it’s a hugely interesting space to be in. I call it participle physics – which is like particle physics, except Robert Jenrick can do it.The above may already be my favourite tense, even compared to the football continuous. “What he’s done there, is he’s thought he could come out of his house, but he’s got blindsided by that flailing threat level, he’s taken some virus right up the nose, and he’s sadly died. You don’t like to see that, do you?”Occupying a similarly liminal space is the new joint biosecurity centre, which is supposed to assess the alert level, and for which Matt Hancock raised his bullshit category to 5 on Monday. “We’re getting it stood up,” the health secretary blustered, as though it were an Ikea bookshelf, or a news story that 250,000 tests had been conducted, as long as you count cake tests, smoke alarm tests, pregnancy tests and online personality tests. “It’s being formulated,” Hancock went on of the biosecurity centre. “It’s being pulled together.” Sounds like it. Let us know if you need an Allen key. (Speaking of the ironing, these days my system is to do it during the 5pm Downing Street briefing. I find it helps to press down on something.)Staying with the good news, Priti Patel and Alok Sharma have reportedly been drafted in to “beef up” the virus war cabinet. So this brains trust now comprises Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Hancock, Patel, Dominic Raab and Sharma. If you had to compare it to Harold Wilson’s kitchen cabinet, I guess you’d say it would be outperformed by the table. If they wanted to beef it up further they could buy 500g of mince. Or a gelatine sachet.Rumours of beef among the beefed-up have been debunked, however, with the Sunday Times scotching the idea that Raab had punched Cummings in a fight broken up by Gove.\u0026nbspIt may be politically incorrect to say so, but one does sometimes wonder if the male temperament is quite suited to roles in public life, what with their hormones. Sorry, hormone. For balance, and to bolster any snowflakes melting at that joke, I’d like to add the progressive view of Darren Grimes. Darren’s a Conservative and Brexit campaigner, and the third brother Jedward refuse to talk about. In April, he endorsed Dominic Raab’s view of Boris Johnson as a fighter. “Raab would know this,” he judged. “He’s a karate black belt that trained and fought so hard he had to have a hip replaced.”Moving on to middle-class etiquette black belt Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons leader has pushed for the full return of MPs to Westminster today and beyond. Having found the one place where he feels he fits in, Rees-Mogg is demanding it be reassembled the way he likes it, no matter the potentially deadly costs to disabled and vulnerable MPs or those they care for. He is assisted by the likes of Tory backbencher Christopher Chope, whose chief claim to fame is blocking a bill to criminalise upskirt photographs, apparently to make some philosophical point about something or other. What an out-and-out Cnut. On Monday, Chope could be found dismissing the 2-metre social distancing rules as mere “guidance”, and suggesting that MPs were some kind of exception to them. Can he not he just use a 2-metre selfie stick like any normal committed pervert?As for the ongoing deceit over the alert level, it has now emerged that chief medical officer Chris Whitty refused to lower it, and thus allow his science to be led by the government. But by now you’ll already be working on the principle that there’s one elite threat level, and another one for the rest of us. All-powerful strategist Dominic Cummings is currently operating on an alert level of minus 5, connoting that he denies the existence not simply of the virus, but of China itself, and has powers to make you lick the railings outside a primary school if you wonder if no-deal Brexit is still the genius idea it once was.Still, it’s great news that Boris Johnson hasn’t had to lose this Carnival Richelieu, this Otto von Jizzmark. I don’t want you to read anything into the fact that alongside Cummings, last week’s other highest-profile person to break the local lockdown rules was a 28-year-old Belgian princeling. This is sadly how we live now, no matter how wrong the public think it is. But sadly, you know? Definitely sadly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea7f92cab34b1bc6681009aa6ad0d80d90c35fe1/95_234_3325_1995/master/3325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a83325634fd1b7709cc30a2c0240acf","title":"the guardian view on a covid 19 parliament unable to do its job","story":"The end of a virtual parliament will reduce the Commons to a rubber stamp for whatever Boris Johnson wantsOn the morning after the general election, Boris Johnson told the country that “parliament must change”. No legislature can be expected to be preserved in aspic. There is a need for our systems of governance to be made more pluralistic and representative. However, Mr Johnson has seized an opportunity in a crisis to concentrate power rather than diffuse it. The end of online voting and the quelling of parliamentary debate will reduce the Commons to a rubber stamp for whatever Mr Johnson wants.What is being done away with for the next month is effectively the pivotal role assigned to parliament: the scrutiny that improves the quality of government, which, given the economic and public health emergencies facing the country, has never been needed more. Since early May, a hybrid parliament has been operating. MPs debated proposed laws and voted in virtual isions. This was considered an imperfect but makeshift arrangement necessary to observe the social distancing guidelines. These rules, instituted to save lives, have not changed.Yet the government has decided to end remote voting and online interventions in debates. Ministers want only a few dozen MPs in the parliamentary chamber to ask questions, and those who wish to vote must queue up to cast their vote in person at the dispatch box. MPs who have been advised to stay home and shield can no longer take part in debates or votes and will have to rely on their whips to find opponents to pair with. It is wrong that parliament should proceed without provision for remote participation when many elected representatives cannot attend in person.The system was given a dry run on Tuesday – and was hardly an advert for parliamentary oversight. Instead of a digital voting system in which all MPs could be involved, we have a ludicrous queueing system in which only two-thirds of parliamentarians can participate. Online voting took 15 minutes, its replacement three times as long. That the new system is slower, more dangerous and less inclusive undermines ministers’ argument that the previous one was not fast enough to deal with the volume of legislation.One suspects that there will now be fewer votes scheduled, which is a step back for democracy. Ministers evidently see no loss in the absent MPs unable to participate in debates on legislation. The message is very clear: we are dealing with a cabinet that is responsive at a stretch to the ruling party, but not to the Commons. Parliamentary democracy is fragile and can easily be disrupted if a powerful group of its members does not accept its rules.A government that controls parliament can suppress information or inquiries which are to its disadvantage, sometimes by refusing to supply information. Team Johnson appears to be both scornful and fearful of scrutiny – silencing scientists who might depart from the script during the damaging Dominic Cummings affair and delaying the publication of the last intelligence and security committee report on Russia. More pertinently, the coronavirus crisis requires an effective parliamentary audit of the far-reaching powers placed in the hands of the executive.It was a former Tory lord chancellor who warned that “human nature being what it is, every human being and every human institution will tend to abuse its legitimate powers unless these are controlled by checks and balances, in which the holders of office are not merely encouraged but compelled to take account of interests and views which differ from their own”. A system was in place that allowed MPs to vote, speak and represent their constituents. In rescinding that, the government has left many voters unrepresented. Mr Johnson betrays a view of the lower chamber as a bystander in governance. A vigilant, inquiring and effective Commons is essential to prevent the misuse of formidable powers in a pandemic. It is extremely bad news for the country that Mr Johnson does not want such a parliament."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0b7f146029c297a188dd18c2e2f42961c42de9c/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6fbbc1b7bd2f2143b199175ed1dc690","title":"the guardian view on bame britain and covid 19 action not words required","story":"Public Health England’s findings on a disproportionate death toll among ethnic minorities must lead to a proper government responseThe publication of Public Health England’s report on the impact of Covid-19 on black, Asian and minority ethnic Britons gave us further confirmation of what has become increasingly obvious. Throughout the epidemic, as the faces of black and Asian doctors, nurses and transport workers have regularly appeared on the pages of newspapers and on our television screens, it has been clear that a disproportionate death toll is being exacted among Britain’s ethnic minorities.The PHE inquiry provides the statistics behind that impression: black and Asian ethnic groups, it found, were all significantly more likely to die with Covid-19 than those from a white British background. People from the Bangladeshi community face twice the risk of dying from Covid-19. One of the earliest tropes to be discarded during this crisis was the notion that the virus “did not discriminate”. In the wake of this report, it is now incumbent on the government to reflect and act on the evidence that it does – and to a large degree.We still do not know all the reasons for the disparities uncovered by the report, and it comes with caveats. Strangely, the study failed to take into account occupation, comorbidities or obesity levels. Other research has shown that this significantly reduces the difference in risks and outcomes between ethnic groups. A number of complex and interlocking factors are in play here. But over the past three months, there is no doubt that we have collectively witnessed a graphic real-time illustration of the potentially lethal impact of social inequality. BAME Britons, who are more likely to be lower-paid, live in poorer accommodation and be employed in public-facing jobs, are running the greatest risk during this crisis.On Tuesday the health secretary, Matt Hancock, denied that publication of the report had been held back because of sensitivities surrounding the death of George Floyd in America. But the timing inescapably foregrounds wider issues that require a proper response from the government. Hours before Mr Hancock spoke to MPs, the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, issued a damning statement in which she said the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on ethnic minorities, in the US, the UK and elsewhere, shone a light on “alarming” levels of inequality that have been ignored for too long.Ms Bachelet called for urgent steps to be taken to prioritise monitoring and testing, and to give targeted information to minority communities. The Labour MP for Tottenham, David Lammy, has repeatedly called for similar action in Britain. New practical guidance is now urgently required, as the British Medical Association made clear in its response to the report.Public health is not merely a scientific affair to be left to epidemiologists and virologists it is undermined by the marginalisation, stress and poverty that often come with racial discrimination. Addressing this must be part of any post-pandemic social settlement, as the country draws appropriate lessons from a time that has exposed fault lines in a way which must not be forgotten. But more immediately, Mr Hancock must do more than tell the House of Commons, as he did on Tuesday, that “black lives matter”. He must act on those words."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c7bdbe843a9e882dc9e8c79b5946bc4caeecde6/63_0_1002_601/master/1002.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d13753dd606c19be3545c40397a32d1","title":"technique critique indulgently addictive web series dissects your favourite performances","story":"Is that accent dire? Is that disguise realistic? Could that car chase have really happened like that? This YouTube series brings in the expertsTo put on an accent is to invite criticism. We all remember those performances in which\u0026nbspan actor has taken a flying leap at mimicking a linguistic form that is not their own and either nailed it, or sailed so far off the side of the balance beam they’ve landed on a broken ankle. In the former camp, in my books: Kate Winslet in The Dressmaker (it’s like she was born in Australia!) and Ben Schnetzer in Pride (he’s not from Northern Ireland?!). In the latter camp, well, you should hear my “Anthony Newley’s ‘Oirish’ accent in Doctor Dolittle” impression.\u0026nbspThat’s why when Wired teamed up with the dialect coach Eric Singer for Technique Critique, a 2016 video essay in which Singer assessed the performances of 32 actors doing accents, it was like Christmas for me.\u0026nbspSinger, a curt but engaging expert, walks us through what makes certain performances either soar or sink: Kate Winslet’s open and\u0026nbsptheatrical “oral posture” (how much she opens her jaw while speaking) means her Polish accent in Jobs doesn’t quite get there Jake Gyllenhaal “nails” his Wyoming accent in Brokeback Mountain by pushing the vowel sounds back in his mouth.\u0026nbspAs an autistic person, so much of my life has been built around masking – in essence, seeming “normal” – by copying turns of phrase, pronunciations and idiolects from popular screen media, so Singer’s accidental how-to guide delighted a part of me I’ve only recently begun to understand. I also love to find out how things work, occasionally by taking them apart and tinkering with them, so discovering the linguistic moving parts of accents and speech has really hit all my special interests at once.The video essay was such a hit that Singer returned for many more – including ones taking in actors playing real-life characters, and “conlangs”, the fictional languages spoken in fantasy and science fiction works – and jazzed millions of viewers about linguistic notions like the uvular africates in Klingon or the Ugandan vowel sounds Forest Whitaker used to embody Idi Amin in The Last King Of Scotland.\u0026nbspIndeed, so popular were Singer’s critiques that the series has now expanded to involve dozens of other experts, from the crime scene analyst and investigator Matthew Steiner examining the forensics in crime scenes from movies and TV shows, to the former CIA chief of disguise Jonna Mendez waxing lyrical about Megan Fox’s quick-change in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and offering the immortal aside “here you have Ben Affleck playing my husband” about Tony Mendez in Argo. And, as a 37-year-old non-driver who still harbours fantasies of becoming a late-blooming stunt person, the US rally champ Wyatt Knox’s breakdown of hair-raising driving scenes was a must see.There’s nothing we as human beings like more, to our secret shame, than squashing down our stifled dreams and existential terror by pretending we’re experts in, say, how to give the impression you were born somewhere you weren’t. “Well, I definitely would have done it differently,” we scoff. For those of us who once went to drama school or harboured Oscar-winning fantasies in the shower, it’s our equivalent of the “she’s got no bodyflight” moment from Strictly Ballroom: au contraire, fate, we are the experts here!\u0026nbspA “new video” notification from the channel is always a cue to glue myself to the laptop, and I hope that Wired continues to ersify not just the topics but the chosen experts, too (so far, the lineup has been very white).But what’s fascinating about Technique Critique is how often our strongly held dinner party opinions are obliterated by the actual experts: that accent you thought was hokey is actually a spot-on masterpiece of regional oral posture the hacking scene that seemed like something out of an airport potboiler is actually true to life.\u0026nbspWe live in an age of increased access to false information where all voices are encouraged to “join the conversation” as the writer and former Man Booker prize judge Rick Gekoski put it some years ago, “the notion that some opinions are better than others – fairer, deeper and more cogent – seems to be slipping from our grasp”. There’s something so reassuring – essential, maybe even thrilling – about expert opinions being given the spotlight in the manner they are in Technique Critique. And, but, despite this, I will die on this hill: Anthony Newley’s Irish accent in Doctor Dolittle is worse than Dick Van Dyke’s Cockney one in Mary Poppins.

Email feast@theLike everyone, I am making sourdough, but I’m throwing away a lot of starter. What can I do with the discard?Isla, BristolI’ve spent an abnormal amount of time Googling “sourdough discard recipes” since Dusty (my own starter) came into my life. For the uninitiated, every time you feed (AKA mix flour and water into) a starter, you first have to remove some of the existing mixture. So, in short, you’re going to have a lot of excess to play with.Happily, not all roads lead to the compost bin. The undisputed queen of sourdough, Martha de Lacey, who, pre-coronavirus, ran classes from her east London home and has since taken things online with The Muff Kitchen, says: “Discard all your excess starter into what I call a ‘trash pot’ and keep it in the fridge. It will continue to ferment even if you don’t feed it, and will eventually get really acidic, smelly, runny and a little bit grey, but that’s fine.”Adding starter does something magical to the taste, says Edd Kimber, author of One Tin Bakes, out in June. He has been making sourdough, chocolate chip and banana bread muffins, the epitome of lockdown baking: “The best banana bread is when the fruit is so dark, it starts to turn into sugars, so discard pushes those funky, fermented flavours forward.”Things aren’t all sweet, though. Kimber also uses discard in crackers, mixing it with olive oil, flour, salt and bicarb (to keep things light) you could even throw in some cheese. De Lacey, however, doesn’t add flour to her crackers, so their taste mimics that of a certain uncompromising spread: “The discard is strong and acidic, so by not adding flour, the sourness makes the crackers taste like Marmite.”As it’s baking, there are a few basic rules to keep in mind. If a recipe calls for bicarb, you might need to up the quantity: “Bicarb is alkaline and starter is acidic,” De Lacey says, “so the bicarb is going to be reduced when you add starter.” Keep an eye on the liquids, too: the older the starter, the more liquid there will be, so some (light) mathematical adjustments may be required. It’s not just the discard that’s in danger of being wasted, either, because – *whisper it* – there is only so much sourdough you can eat. Turn slices into croutons to round out a salad, or channel Feast’s own Thomasina Miers, who makes bread pudding even more joyous by soaking sourdough slices, raspberries and nectarines in custard, then tops with almonds and coconut flakes.For the ultimate holiday-at-home vibes, though, Yotam Ottolenghi makes a lid for seafood stew with sourdough brushed with garlic, olive oil, parsley and basil. Close your eyes and you could almost be in the Mediterranean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d6328b6c7e36055b1fcc71ad1b061e6540af276/53_115_3437_2062/master/3437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24487988efcdee0009adbd1f6b269b8b","title":"some premier league clubs face three matches seven days fixture list","story":"The Premier League is close to presenting a provisional fixture list for the remainder of the season to its clubs, with the unlucky ones facing a sequence of three games in seven days.The league’s football operations team are working to finalise a schedule that features full match rounds on six long weekends, beginning with Friday 19 June to Monday 22 June, and three midweek slots, incorporating games on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. The intention is for the midweek rounds to be 23-25 June, 7-9 July and 14-16 July.There are two additional fixtures, which are the games in hand from when the season was stopped – Manchester City v Arsenal and Aston Villa v Sheffield United – which will be the first to be played, on Wednesday 17 June. The hope is to finish the league season on the weekend of 25-26 July, with the FA Cup final on Saturday 1 August.It was agreed by the clubs that this was the preferred framework and, before a meeting on Thursday, the league’s operations team have sought to allocate fixtures to specific dates. It has been a stressful task, with various interested parties to align, including broadcasters and safety advisory groups.The operations team have prioritised the league’s guidance that teams should not play twice in 48 hours. It remains to be seen whether they can spare every club this unwanted possibility. However, it is inevitable that, in a best-case scenario, some clubs will play three times in seven days. For example, after some Monday games, the clubs involved would have to play on Thursday and then at least one of them on Sunday, as both could not play again in the lone slot the following Monday.June:\u0026nbspWed 17 Manchester City v Arsenal, Aston Villa v Sheffield United Fri 19-Mon 22 First of the nine rounds of remaining fixtures Tue 23-Thu 25 Round two Fri 26-Mon 29 Start of round three four FA Cup quarter-finals Tue 30-Thu 2 July Round‑three fixtures involving clubs who played in the FA Cup\u0026nbspJuly:\u0026nbspFri 3-Mon 6 Round four Tue 7-Thu 9 Round five Fri 10-Mon 13 Round six Tue 14-Thu 16 Round seven Fri 17-Mon 20 Most round‑eight fixtures FA Cup semi-finals Tue 21-Thu 23 Round‑eight fixtures involving clubs who played in the FA\u0026nbspCup semi-finals Sat 25 or Sun 26 Ninth and final round\u0026nbspThe FA Cup quarter-finals are slated for the weekend of 27-28 June and the semi-finals for 18-19 July. The only two free midweek slots follow the Cup weekends, allowing for league games displaced by these ties to be staged. With the original running order of the league match rounds set to be respected, the games that stand to be bumped into midweek by the quarter-finals are Bournemouth v Newcastle, Arsenal v Norwich, Brighton v Manchester United, Everton v Leicester, Manchester City v Liverpool, Sheffield United v Tottenham and West Ham v Chelsea. The provisional fixture list will be debated at Thursday’s meeting and there are sure to be complaints from those who feel that the spacing is against them. The hope is the schedule can be finessed and signed off, however.Teams will ramp up preparations for the restart after the league gave approval for friendlies as long as strict guidelines around hygiene are followed, with instructions including players travelling in their own cars, possibly in their kit.These games will enable clubs to build match fitness and will be played at stadiums or training grounds. Clubs, who were sent a guidance note by the league on Tuesday, will need to ensure they adhere to physical-distancing measures. Players involved will need to have recorded a negative coronavirus test in the most recent checks.Risk assessments of stadiums and training grounds are also required and teams will not be allowed to travel more than 90 minutes. It is understood Newcastle will be granted dispensation to travel further to find opponents.Chief among other matters to be discussed on Thursday are scenarios in the event the season cannot be finished – with an unweighted points-per-game system favoured. Also on the agenda will be the issue of neutral venues for a small number of high-risk games, the continued use of VAR, match-day safety protocols, broadcast requirements, amendments to the 25-man squads submitted in February and whether five substitutes are to be allowed.

The sceptics among us smell a rat – with the alert level the same and the government’s five tests unmet, track-and-trace not ready and a government desperate to deflect attention from its shortcomings – is this easing really for our benefit, or just a way to kick responsibility back on to the population?\u0026nbspIn other words, we are living in one giant grey area, where judgment, common sense, good faith and, most of all, manners are going to be doing a hell of a lot of heavy lifting. So what advice do the etiquette experts – and the boffins – offer?\u0026nbspWilliam Hanson, an etiquette coach and host of the podcast Help I Sexted My Boss, was born to answer this question. “There was an awful tendency, before all this, to respond to an invitation with: ‘Who else is going to be there?’” (This implies you are checking that it will be cool enough, and is beyond rude.) “Now it is permissible, even healthy, to ask that. But you may still want to disguise the question, so if you’re bringing a cake or a homemade cordial, say: ‘Let me know how many it will be for.’” No manners specialist in town has given me an acceptable get-out for turning up only to find a packed party. Talk numbers before you arrive and then, as Debora Robertson, the co-author of Manners: A Modern Field Guide (out next spring), says: “It’s your job to express clearly what you need in a social situation, so just say: ‘I’m not ready yet for that.’” After that, it’s all in the tone and the intention. “If it’s not your intention to make people feel like they’re reckless or stupid, then that won’t come across in your tone.”\u0026nbspAgain, if you explain yourself plainly and make it a boundary of yours, a decent friend will accept that even if they think you are extremely cautious. Adam Collins, a doctor of emergency medicine, says: “If everything is washed and clean, and everyone, while they’re there, has their own inidual set of plates and cups, that should be fine.”\u0026nbspYou are now allowed to use someone else’s toilet if you wipe down surfaces afterwards. If you don’t want people to use your loo, tell them before they arrive. Regardless, Diana Mather, the author of The Good Manners Bears and host of the Granny Manners YouTube channel, has this timeless piece of advice: “Make sure you go before you leave.”If you’re happy for people to use your loo, Hanson says: “I would, as a host, put Dettol wipes out. I would hope that people got what I was trying to imply.” As a guest, you don’t then need to be sheepish about having cleaned the toilet, because they in effect told you to do that. I know. This is all getting pretty intense.\u0026nbspAccording to Mather, absolutely not as long as you would normally. The longer you are there, the more some of you will drink, the less observant of social distancing you will become, the more of an awkward spot you will put anxious friends and relatives in. It’s not a four-hour gig. It would be polite, as a host, to set the terms – shall we have a drink between six and seven? – “And if it gets to seven and people are still chatting,” Mather says, “you can push it to half past seven.” How do you make people leave, though? This bit is easy, apparently. “You stand up,” Mather says authoritatively. “Everyone should take that hint.”There is no way to not offer these around, yet I’m struggling to see how you would get a Quaver off someone without coming closer than two metres, so it’s sort of a pass-agg move. You’re asking them to either break the rules or make a big deal out of not breaking them. I think you just have to eat these things privately, or buy more than one bag of Quavers.At a whole population level, public health agencies are trying to move people away from buffet-style eating, where you are all digging in to the same bowl, and a large number of people are using the same serving spoon. However, this doesn’t mean that you can’t safely cut a cake for six people or prepare salads for people.Hanson says: “If it’s a serious breach that is breaking the rules, then fine. But be prepared, if it becomes known who reported them, that is a serious breach of friendship and you probably won’t be friends with them going forward.” Robertson is more trenchant: “We’ve all got to stop the grassing-up thing. It came too easily to some people.” I think, from both a moral and manners perspective, no.\u0026nbspIt’s really up to you, but don’t leave things because you feel embarrassed or awkward. Robertson says: “Phone them up, or email, or send a postcard to re-establish connection. Just be normal, don’t be weird.”Remember, too, that it’s not all about you. We all have a tendency to blame ourselves when communication breaks down, but it takes two not to tango. “There’s this brilliant story in the Duchess of Devonshire’s autobiography,” Robertson says. “She’s upstairs on her wedding day, and she’s waiting to come down, and 85 million people are waiting to see her. And she says to her mother: ‘I feel a bit shy.’ And her mother says: “Don’t be ridiculous, nobody’s looking at you.’” I mean, it is brilliant. But mothers are also weird.\u0026nbspI am currently going with: “I have nothing to say and I hate Zoom.”Collins takes the point: “Given that you’re allowed to have as many different sets of six people as you want, to me, that’s no different to having a barbecue of 12.” This is the moment at which you berate them with science. The magic number is because any group larger than six finds it hard to stay in the same conversation, at two metres apart, so will naturally start to cluster together. Just be reasonable, is the overall medical message here.\u0026nbspSomeone doing it by accident can be repelled by a light remark. With a deliberate offender, Hanson says, you have to be firm. “You have got to step in and say: ‘It’s two metres, I’d appreciate if you would respect that.’ I wouldn’t say sorry, necessarily. Keep it short. If you soften it too much, it will weaken the impact. I know some of my friends probably would transgress, and I just won’t meet up with them until this is over.”Children are relatively unaffected by Covid and yet Covid\u0026nbspis all we think about. But there’s a danger that because of this we might forget about their other needs altogether. Heneghan counsels strongly against this. “There’s been a lack of thinking about our younger generation, right across the board up to university age. They are at such low risk, them going back to school is no more risky than it is after Christmas, when there’s been an outbreak of influenza.” They need education, but they also need fellowship, play, fresh air and normality. So yes, they should be allowed to play with one another. If they are too young to observe any meaningful social distance, you just have to chase them apart (try not to be terrifying).Heneghan says: “I got into a car with a person on Saturday. I’m also an urgent care GP, he had to drive me around. The important point here is that we’ve come through an era where, if you’re ill, you take a paracetamol and carry on. That has to end. The important alertness is that if you feel unwell, you have to take it seriously and get yourself a test.”Collins gives something close to a definitive answer on this, and all things: “What people should focus on is not: ‘Can I do this specific thing?’ It’s: ‘What am I doing here that is genuinely beneficial or genuinely necessary?’ Lockdown is driving us all a little bit crazy and it affects some people’s mental health in really serious ways.” It’s really not as simple as: “Responsible people stay locked down for ever” and very few rules are absolute. “You have to ask yourself, honestly, whether you’re doing everything you can to protect yourself and protect others.”Oh, hello fresh minefield. Alan Redman is an organisational psychologist at Birkbeck, University of London, with a sideline in the psychology of commuter cycling. His top manners tips are: “One, wavesmile at other riders. Always. Two, don’t shout at drivers or pedestrians. Three, don’t overtake and then immediately slow down.” More broadly, he says, there is too much focus on commuting being terrifying – it is at the start, but people overcome that fairly fast and afterwards get a huge sense of zeal from their sense of legitimacy on the road and their feeling of having sailed over the fear barrier.\u0026nbspAs it is allowed for two people to meet, there is no reason you can’t go out on a date, so long as you can cope with pubs not being open. Given the two-metre distance, however, you probably can’t do much else. There is a hilarious legal loophole, here – as of this week it is illegal for two people from different households to meet indoors and have sex. The rules around outdoor gatherings, however, are guidance not law, so in theory you could breach your two-metre rule and have sex in the garden without getting arrested. So long as you weren’t overlooked, which would of course breach another law. And so long as there were six of you. No, wait …\u0026nbspYou can continue to hug members of your own household. You can definitely hug any of the six people you have just had outdoor sex with, in for a penny etc (joke! This is a joke). People I’ve been extremely tempted to hug include those who have definitely had the virus already, with the antibody test to prove it, and those who are at the end of their lives and claim not to care whether they get it or not. The expert advice remains: do not hug any of these people.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97370dc301ef574ffd5ec8bc9dd63b206fc2e131/86_199_5091_3057/master/5091.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7a48c820c2f5b36fc99b2f8ee79f1ba","title":"isolation is hard going but then so is escaping it how to ease your way out of lockdown","story":"After months of staying inside it’s natural to feel nervous about leaving the safety of our homes - even if we desperately want to. One writer, who is no stranger to self-isolating, explains what to expectIt is a strange feeling to be sick in a pandemic. I don’t just mean for the ones who fall ill from the virus. I mean the rest of us. Those who were ill long before “coronavirus” entered the vocabulary, who got sick and stir-crazy when it wasn’t headline news. Suddenly, everyone is experiencing what those of us with chronic illness have long been familiar with: the urge to break out after being trapped inside for months – and the quiet nerves about doing it.Chronically ill people are the experts in this strange new world. We are well aware the human body is not an impenetrable beast, that immune systems are fragile, that nerve endings can sting,\u0026nbspthat lungs can struggle to gasp for air.\u0026nbspWe are also used to isolation: the mind-numbing boredom of the 26th Friday without going to the pub, and the unrivalled joy of the first overpriced gin afterwards.I have not left the house for nine months, and it is more than two years since I became largely housebound.\u0026nbspI hate that word. “Housebound”. As if you were an inanimate object, tied to the back gate. The\u0026nbspbad winter flu of 2017\u0026nbspcombined with what I’ll call some D-grade genetics and I developed a kind of post-viral fatigue.\u0026nbspI’d like to downplay it for laughs, but ventilators are hard to make jokes about.\u0026nbspI couldn’t breathe, could barely move every muscle hurt.\u0026nbspIt would have been easier to have been hit by a truck, rather than just feel like it. At least I would have had a good story. But as the world is learning, viruses can be – what’s the medical term? – total bastards. I became housebound. The word doesn’t matter. The result is the same.\u0026nbspAs lockdown slowly eases, I have found myself thinking about what it is to leave the house after a long spell inside. The rest of the public will, in time, find themselves in a bizarre wonderland: visiting a friend’s house again, getting on a train, sitting in a bar.\u0026nbspThese are the firsts that are not actually firsts, the new experiences you have had a thousand times before. It would be natural if you were feeling anxious. Isolation is hard going, but then so is escaping it.\u0026nbspI’ve been through that particular looking glass myself.\u0026nbspWhen I fell ill, life in every normal way stopped. There was no going out. No inviting people in. Just bed, and my thoughts. Luckily I am fascinating, but there are limits to even my internal chat. Months pass, the pain and exhaustion hum, and\u0026nbsplife as you know it has fallen in on itself.\u0026nbspEventually, it is a\u0026nbspThursday night, though you have lost all knowledge of what day it is, and\u0026nbspyou find yourself working out how many tiny cracks there are on the walls. It is\u0026nbsp3am\u0026nbspyou think of the last time you sat in a restaurant and wonder if you ever will again.\u0026nbspI don’t know if it was growing up with a disability, but I was always the sort of person to appreciate the everyday moments. I looked at the water as the Thames rippled in the evening light. I paused to laugh as a mate danced drunk in the road (do not try this). Stuck at home, I became grateful for that, as if each frame was safely banked and the memories could be replayed on a loop.\u0026nbspWhen you are a child, they say television restricts your mind. But when you are ill, it opens it. Watching hours of\u0026nbspthe Tour de France inside four walls, I was out of bed and soaring over the sky-blue Alps. Dozing through the London marathon, I was back at work wading through the noise of the city. With Springwatch, I was in the park listening to the birds sing.\u0026nbspStill, I ached for the world. I missed people: the arms of those I knew and crowds of those I didn’t. I missed nights out: eating food someone else had cooked, the smell of cigarettes as we huddled next to a garden heater.\u0026nbspI missed getting ready to go out as much as being out: putting on an uncomfortable bra and the way mascara smells when it sets.\u0026nbspI even missed trains: the freedom of the tracks, the possibility of a departure board.\u0026nbspA few months in, I\u0026nbspbegan to collect photos. Photos of people I loved.\u0026nbspThe places I used to go the carefree smiles and the towering buildings. Instagram squares printed and hung on a grid.\u0026nbspIt was my own\u0026nbsp#lastnormalphoto\u0026nbsphashtag, except for my eyes only. When I had started to recover enough to go outside a little, I would take a photo of myself each time. At work. At the park. To prove to myself I had been there. I had done that. The trees were not a figment of my imagination. My lungs had breathed the air. I had been myself, at least for a while. I call this the narcissistic phase.\u0026nbspThe first time I saw outside again was to go to the hairdresser, which in retrospect seems apt for where we are now. It had been five months since I had fallen ill and my hair had carried on, even when I had stopped. It hadn’t occurred to me to try a lockdown-style home cut and I resembled a pasty Rapunzel.\u0026nbspWhen your body has denied you the chance to take the mundane excursions most people do every day, having that opportunity again feels electrifying.\u0026nbspIn the spring air, the blossom unfurled and lined the streets with pink.\u0026nbspChunks of blond hair dropped to the floor, the smell of perming solution in the air.\u0026nbspManoeuvring through the streets to go back home, I fixed on the surroundings. The paths lined with blooming trees, the strangers carrying the weekly shop.\u0026nbspIt felt like a scene from that\u0026nbsp90s\u0026nbspBrendan Fraser film where the time-travelling caveman\u0026nbspsees cars for the first time. Wonder mixed with terror.\u0026nbspThere is a feeling, somewhere between walking through your front door and reaching Superdrug, when your brain wants to protect you from the outside world. You tell yourself you are going to die, possibly next to the tampons. You are not, of course, and you breathe slowly, reminding yourself that you used to do this all the time. That you are fine. That you are actually great.I remember the panic attack I had the third time I went outside again, but I remember the happiness, too. The 99 I slowly licked in the park and the towering Flake, like I was\u0026nbspeight years old again, triumphant by the ice-cream van at the school gates. I remember the utter joy of holding people I loved for the first time in a year: the smell of familiar perfume and the feel of stubble on my cheek. I remember the other\u0026nbspfeeling wavering in my stomach: relief.\u0026nbspI had found something that I had lost, if only for a little while.\u0026nbspI won’t pretend chronic illness is the same as lockdown. One occurs because sickness has already come, the other is an attempt to avoid it. One is usually permanent, the other is temporary – even if doesn’t feel like it.\u0026nbspBut the lines between healthy and sick seem more blurred than they used to. Or, to put it another way, we are all a little housebound now.\u0026nbspEstablished wisdom says not to take advice from someone in their pyjamas, but if I could offer any, it would be this.\u0026nbspThe thing that tends to keep you awake at night during these times is not what you miss, but the fear that you will never get it back.\u0026nbspYou almost certainly will. You will in time regain the precious things: hug your mum, sit in a theatre, gorge on a McDonald’s at the end of a night out.\u0026nbspThere is such happiness in that – in rediscovering the people and places we love. But it is not ungrateful if you\u0026nbspfeel less than joy, if you feel some pressure or panic lurking at the thought of going back outside. It is kind to give yourself time to readjust. To go just half a\u0026nbspmile from home at first. To start small.\u0026nbspSavour the little details ground yourself in the sights and sounds. The unfurling of the lilac. Your best friend’s laugh.\u0026nbspIf you still find yourself struggling, that’s OK too. Don’t pathologise normal human responses. If you have not seen your sister in months, it is perfectly natural to be sad. If you haven’t been in a crowd since March, it is easy to be anxious – even more so if you’re shielding and are now going out for the very first time.\u0026nbspSimilarly, if you find those feelings dominating your mind and restricting your ability to get on, professional help is there. It is well known that mental health support is not always available on the NHS, but GPs are still the best start. Many therapists are now online, and some are even free.People talk about a grand return to normal after lockdown but the truth is, “normal” is hard to refind. Nothing is waiting for you exactly as you left it events inevitably alter our viewpoint, each of us rarely leaves a rough period unmarked. And that is OK.\u0026nbspThings change. Nothing is guaranteed. You adapt, perhaps even finding something better than before.\u0026nbspWe are taught to always be moving. That a night in front of Netflix is wasted. That Fomo is the modern way.If being unable to leave home does anything, it helps you re-evaluate those particular untruths. “Home”\u0026nbspis just a different way of living, no less because it is smaller. It is a thing to be valued, to perhaps see more kindly than before. But if – when – you do get back out in the world, it will be all the more beautiful from your time away. Lick an ice-cream on a bench, as the summer sun warms your skin.\u0026nbspMemories go round on a loop, inviting us out once again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bb7dccfd407ab59cf38f78ee7cf6b75b03cfe97/0_242_5173_3103/master/5173.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1024ff121714198bfbc9ec15db8b7048","title":"muddy waters why swimming in the sea might make you sick","story":"A study has found that sea-bathers are three times as likely to report infections as people who don’t have a dip.

And even then, that’s not really such a great idea.

Brexit was a certainty, the Conservatives had won a big parliamentary majority, and the Labour party was more estranged than ever from its old heartlands. Having covered a country in mounting political ferment since 2010, we thought we could at least put Anywhere but Westminster on pause.But in March, everything changed once again. As the Covid-19 crisis reached the decisive point of lockdown, we decided the series had to be reawakened. But if we were as subject to the new restrictions as anyone else, and just as scared of the virus, how could we do it?The answer has defined our experience of the past two months. Instead of travelling to places, we have issued call-outs for information about what people are living through, and footage of their lives, usually shot on their phones. In addition, often using contacts we have acquired over the past 10 years, we have approached old and new sources, and asked them to participate. A mountain of video has arrived, which we and our team have spent long days and nights combining with our own material and turning into finished films. The result, by a mixture of accident and design, has been an ongoing series of videos that tells the story of this crisis from the core of people’s actual experience.We’ve chronicled the lives of a 26-year-old man whose arthritis medication suppresses his immune system, meaning he has to live in complete isolation, and an intensive care nurse who facilitates people saying their last goodbyes via Zoom. We’ve spoken to families whose experience of lockdown is light years away from any “bake cakes and learn Spanish” cliches, and people who have spoken movingly about losing loved ones. Crucially, we have also gone out of our way to explore how communities have come together, and provided new kinds of support to friends and neighbours.Unintentionally, it feels like what we’re doing is true to most people’s experience of the crisis – and, in particular, the mixture of an often lonely world suddenly mediated via the internet, and an unexpected sense of common purpose and togetherness. It sometimes feels as if encouraging people to document their own experiences is sparking a change in the way we feel about our journalism, and presenting us with a new challenge we will have to face when the crisis recedes: how to push even further beyond the standard approaches of the media, and give an even more authentic sense of where the country is going.For now, one thing seems particularly clear. The convulsive political events of the past 10 years were at least partly about rising inequality and insecurity, and people’s sense that power was too distant. Covid-19 has highlighted those things to the point that they are even more inescapable than before – which, for us, means that the work has to go on.Stay at home, keep your distance from people and don’t mix with anyone outside of your circle: the rules of lockdown are almost the polar opposite of the rules of Anywhere but Westminster.Our process has been to get out there to places the media doesn’t normally visit, get close to people, and talk to those outside our bubble. Seeing a political media that was too socially distant, we wanted to counteract it with a kind of journalistic gap-closing.Through the ruptures of Corbynism, Brexit, and the rise of populism, the idea that there was a gap between the way politics was presented in the news and lived in the world became accepted, and even a cliche. After 10 years, I sometimes felt like one of an ageing pair of small-time bank robbers, always coming back for one last job.But coronavirus and the resulting lockdown brought us new purpose – or a new version of our old purpose. Once again, the news was dominated by images from government briefings from Westminster and political journalists trying to hold them to account – this time over Zoom. There was also a blizzard of figures: infection rates, deaths, jobs lost, workers in furlough. We wanted to give more space to ordinary people to speak – putting human stories to those numbers and policies, but also capturing the ways in which communities were coming together to help each other.Same old problem, then: the difference is that we are working from our bedrooms and putting the films together using footage sent to us by people around Britain. Like everything else about this moment, it’s been a journey of discovery, with highs and lows. I will not miss wrestling with hundreds of clips shot in different formats, sent to me along with a constant stream of messages, questions, and pinging alerts. But I have also found moments of emotion in the footage that it would be hard to match in anything I shot myself.A paradox has become clear: while the issues we cover have always been bottom-up, the process of making a film that has a narrative viewers will watch and engage with is a very top-down process, requiring lots of control in the hands of the person filming and editing. Normally we videographers film with great attention to detail, trying to get each shot just right, and capturing every aspect of a scene in sequences of shots. Now I’m in collaboration with people who don’t even hold the camera the right way round (hint: it’s not vertical). But what they lack in technical skills they have made up for in authenticity.So, in many ways, this has been a process of letting go – of the old standards that we thought were so important, and of the visual “grammar” we have taken for granted. Instead we have found value in a new kind of intimacy and sincerity that comes from people having filmed their own stories, and the greater sense of control they have in the process.

Experts also warned that while many households managed to repay their debts during lockdown, the hit to workers’ wages and rising job losses at the onset of the deepest recession in living memory would force others deep into the red.Laura Suter, a personal finance analyst at the investment platform AJ Bell,\u0026nbspsaid: “The lockdown has created a ide in the country, with some households seeing cuts to income, job losses or being furloughed, while others are seeing their finances benefit from an enforced halt to much of their spending.”Consumers had been racking up increasingly higher levels of debt on credit cards, personal loans and car finance in recent years, with total borrowing surpassing the levels recorded before the 2008 financial crisis.However, the pace of growth in consumer borrowing had started to slow before the crisis struck, with households making the first net repayment of credit card debt in almost seven years in December, amid a slowdown in spending ahead of Christmas amid uncertainty over the general election and Brexit.As consumers rein in their spending, the figures from the Bank showed a sharp increase in business debts triggered by the steep decline in sales.In a reflection of the rush to raise short-term funding as income evaporates, UK private sector businesses took on a further £8.4bn of bank debt in April, on top of a record £30.2bn borrowed in March as the Covid-19 crisis struck.Thomas Pugh, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said households were likely to have continued paying down their debts in May as lockdown measures continued, while businesses probably borrowed more to stay afloat.“But even when the lockdown is lifted, consumers are likely to remain cautious and many firms will struggle with low demand and the mountain of new debt,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b56ec416b7a907d7bf3b78cbe96b1675bf6e62e6/0_94_5160_3097/master/5160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9974e19cfcdef22172fd06bcd70957ce","title":"the 100 greatest uk no 1s no 4 donna summer i feel love","story":"Hypnotic synth, peerless vocals and visionary ambition make the 1977 genre-busting hit a turning point in pop and a truly timeless trackIn 1975, a stellar team based in Germany laid the groundwork for a musical revolution, the aftershock of which is still being felt today. American singer Donna Summer, alongside production and songwriting duo Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, were responsible for the torrid single Love to Love You Baby. In technical terms, the track’s modernism can be heard in a heavily foregrounded 44 beat bolstered, metronomically, by rudimentary drum programming. But that isn’t what initially captured the imaginations of the disco cognoscenti.During a coke-fuelled orgy at his LA mansion, the head of Casablanca records, Neil Bogart, took a break from the festivities to phone Bellotte in a state of high excitement saying that everyone was “fucking to this track” and demanding constant rewinds. He asked the trio to expand the song until it filled the side of an album, something that was relatively easy for them to do because of the rigid grid of drum machine beats. The resulting track, replete with 22 simulated orgasms (courtesy of the 12-inch version at least), earned Summer, a practising Christian and trained gospel singer, a BBC ban, a trans-Atlantic hit and a new record deal with Casablanca.I Feel Love began life in 1977 as a bookend track to round off a disco concept album. The theme of I Remember Yesterday, Summer’s fifth album, was to evoke different decades, starting in the 1940s and ending up with a song that would represent the future. Moroder and Bellotte realised the sci-fi textures they needed could only be produced using a modular synthesiser. The pair had previously used a Moog Modular 3P to record Son of My Father but found the process of wrangling the complicated, Tardis-like rack of oscillators and patch cables to be “a pain in the butt”. The process was complicated by the fact the synth was owned by a pop-phobic avant garde composer called Eberhard Schoener.But Schoener’s assistant Robby Wedel – the unsung hero of the I Feel Love story – borrowed the Moog and reassembled it in Moroder’s studio. As well as supplying the technology, Wedel solved the most pressing of many problems that the team faced in creating the sound of the future by sequencing the electronic composition to the 16-track recorder. It was this act that made it such an outstandingly avant garde track – no one knew the synth was capable of this, not even Robert Moog himself. But the task remained painstaking. The highly temperamental instrument would not stay in tune for long and had to be manually retuned after each 20-second section was recorded.Wedel nails one of the key ingredients of the track when he describes the bassline as being like “a giant’s hammer on a wall”, its power matched only by trance-inducing hypnotism created by astute use of a delay-like effect. If you listen to the track through good headphones you can hear the bassline hit first via the left channel only to play again a sixteenth later through the right channel, giving it that instantly recognisable juddering spatiality.Of course, it’s not entirely machine-made. Apart from Summer’s peerless vocal performance, which included a spontaneously improvised falsetto, there’s also the beat. Wedel, who knew the Moog inside out, used it to generate hi-hat and snare sounds with white noise but couldn’t quite get the bass drum sound right, so a session musician, Keith Forsey, was brought in to play the metronomic 44.Remarkably, Casablanca didn’t think that much of I Feel Love’s future potential and it was consigned to the B-side of the Can’t We Just Sit Down (And Talk It Over) single, released 1 May 1977. Yet the track soon took on a life of its own and began tearing up dancefloors. By 2 July, it had been released as an A-side. It went to No 1 in the UK, Australia, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands.For many, what was already a damn near perfect track, was – somehow – improved the following year by a remix. Patrick Cowley, a visionary cosmic disco producer who was part of Sylvester’s backing band, warped the track into a psychedelic 15-minute masterpiece. What’s truly stunning about his remix is that it was a bootleg made from an off-the-shelf copy of the album, with him adding extra percussion, crackling snare fills, and washes of ecstatic electronic noise. Not having the luxury of having Wedel sync his work, he did everything painstakingly by hand. While initially only available on DJ acetates and white labels during Cowley’s active lifetime, it got an official release at the end of 1982 and became a massive hit all over again.It’s impossible to completely quantify the effect of I Feel Love on dance music. It signified the end of one era in disco (that of lush orchestration and large bands) and the start of another (the producer as electronic auteur backing a a). Along with Kraftwerk’s Trans-Europe Express, it acted as a conduit between the avant garde and the dancefloors of the world. It foreshadowed the rise of house music and techno. Despite early outlier users such as Stevie Wonder, I Feel Love decisively recast the image of the synthesiser. It was no longer primarily the tool of pallid European futurists and the toy of rich prog rock musicians, but the key to dance music’s revolutionary potential going into the 1980s and beyond.Not only has I Feel Love never gone out of fashion, it has consistently jumped between genres in the intervening decades with incredible ease. I Feel Love is, or has been, a staple of house, techno, electroclash and nu-disco sets while also exerting an influence on post punk, new wave, EBM, hi-energy, P-Funk and industrial. There is no end to the list of artists who have been influenced by this track, but one exchange acts as a revelatory example: in 1977, Brian Eno charged into the studio while David Bowie was recording, brandishing a copy of I Feel Love, and stated excitedly: “This is it, look no further. This is going to change the sound of club music for the next 15 years.” His only mistake was one of gross under-exaggeration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fa2082e08a61e9d6523e9adf0c13e7d0f0251ef/0_106_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d98ce4552898ffc78ff82874e3ed65e9","title":"england easing out of lockdown is it safe podcast","story":"Health officials and even government scientists have warned against the easing of the coronavirus lockdown in England, saying it could lead to a surge in infections.

This is substantially higher than the usual estimate for influenza of about 1.4 to 2.0. The infection rate dropped incrementally with the series of recommendations that started on 12 March, but did not fall precipitously until the full lockdown was announced 11 days later. Those restrictions have meant the R0 now appears to be below 1.0 in the UK, and on Monday the government eased some of the lockdown rules, allowing people to meet outside in groups of up to six, outdoor markets and car showrooms to begin operating again, and schools to reopen.

It incited a furious reaction from many MPs, including those who are shielding and black and ethnic minority (BAME) politicians.In a sombre moment in the debate that preceded the vote, the shadow Commons leader, Valerie Vaz, launched a blistering attack on the government, asking what “risk assessment” the government had done for both BAME MPs and workers in the parliament buildings.Since 21 April a virtual parliament has allowed MPs to vote online or using their phones instead of cramming into backrooms in the House of Commons which ide the “ayes” from the “noes”.But Tuesday’s first physically-distanced voting demonstrated how the system risked being choked, despite Rees-Mogg’s claim it would be better for democracy.Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow work and pensions secretary, described the queuing system as “genius level stuff” while Neil Coyle, the Labour MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark, asked if there were\u0026nbspany “cat shepherds” in Westminster to move the queue through quickly.\u0026nbsp“Queue two doesn’t even begin in courtyard. Welcome to what Johnson and Mogg think is acceptable for a 21st century modern democracy,” Coyle tweeted, photographing the queue weaving its way through the parliamentary building through the lawned courtyard the underground secure passage to the Portcullis House atrium where it ended.“Government should be wholly embarrassed,” he added.\u0026nbspStewart McDonald, the Scottish National party MP for Glasgow South, said it was “absurd”, quipping that it might give the Conservatives “a practice run for the long airport queues post-Brexit”. He also complained that some MPs were not paying heed to social distancing.In a partial climbdown, Rees-Mogg said he would put forward a second motion on Wednesday to allow the hybrid parliament to continue to allow MPs to attend debates virtually.However, while he did not rule out a virtual or proxy vote, there were no plans to allow MPs who could not attend the house on medical grounds to have a vote on legislation.He pledged there would be a “pairing” arrangement that would ensure each MP unable to make the vote because of shielding issues would be matched by a non-voting government MP.But he faced an immediate backlash, with MPs living hundreds of miles from Westminster branding it “democracy for the elite”.The Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland, Alistair Carmichael, who took 18 hours to get to Westminster because of flight restrictions, said Rees-Mogg was giving a green light to a parliament for people “within driving distance of London”.\u0026nbspThe Democratic Unionist Ian Paisley said the move would “obstruct” the right to vote of the party’s eight MPs as there were flight restrictions in place between Belfast and London, while the SNP’s leader in the Commons, Ian Blackford, said it had taken him 16 hours to get to London because he had to get the sleeper train. “What a waste of time in the middle of a national health crisis when MPs should be attending to their overflowing postbags,” he said.Carmichael said it was also irresponsible. He would be staying in London “for the duration” because he felt he would have no choice but to self-isolate for 14 days if he returned to the islands from a potentially infectious environment.Rees-Mogg, who lives close to Westminster, questioned the democratic value of MPs who were voting on their phones or from their home offices.\u0026nbsp“Voting while taking a sunny walk or watching television does democracy an injustice,” he told the 30 or so physically-distanced MPs present in the chamber.\u0026nbspRees-Mogg claimed it was in voters’ interests to get parliament back up and running as legislation had been “clogged” with “no detailed, line-by-line consideration of bills that will affect people’s lives”.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c3054a52f81582c624562fb08c410a19f780454/0_284_5294_3177/master/5294.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca0433f8c5e7b2367e6f8f7c9013b1e0","title":"the tories turn parliament into the worlds worst theme park","story":"Jacob Rees-Mogg quashes digital Commons in favour of every vote becoming a 45-minute conga lineWhere to start? If it wasn’t already bad enough that the UK has the highest mortality rate in Europe and Dominic Cummings is given a free pass on his midnight flit to Durham and a 60-mile round trip eyesight test, the Tory government has now decided to turn the House of Commons into the world’s worst theme park. One where the only attraction is the kilometre-long queue itself for a ride that doesn’t exist.Some countries have used the global health crisis to discover the best of themselves. We have actively worked on becoming the worst possible iteration of ourselves. Still, at least the rest of the world can piss themselves laughing at our expense. So maybe look on it as a global public service.To recap. Before the Whitsun recess, the Commons had a perfectly serviceable hybrid participation procedure, along with a fully functional remote voting system, to enable parliament to operate during the coronavirus pandemic. But Jacob Rees-Mogg wasn’t happy with that. Having spent several weeks trying to close down the Commons last year during the unlawful prorogation, the leader of the house has now decided he wants it to make it as inaccessible for MPs as possible.Anyone who is over 70, is pregnant or has health, childcare or travel issues is now effectively barred from parliament. With their constituents disenfranchised. Jakey likes to pretend to be the great parliamentarian – the master democrat steeped in centuries of tradition – but the reality is that Westminster is just a stage on which he gets to cosplay his public school fantasies in a suit that’s several sizes too big for him. Ideally the only people he wants in the Commons are people just like him: MPs with large London houses, a private income and an inherited nanny.For reasons best know to himself – perhaps he had forgotten the chamber was still restricted to 50 MPs so he would still be basically on his own during prime minister’s questions – Boris Johnson chose to indulge Jakey’s perversions by turning the vote into a three-line whip for Tory MPs. And as most of them are barely sensate lobby fodder with no mind of their own, they duly obliged by voting to deny other MPs a vote. Not for the first time in the past few weeks, the UK was putting on a good show of acting like a banana republic.Still, at least we got to enjoy the spectacle of Tory MPs having to suffer the humiliation of waiting for 43 minutes in a queue that snaked round Westminster Hall and back into Portcullis House. I shouldn’t think Jakey and Liam Fox can remember the last time they had to queue for anything. And even when they got to the front, dozens could barely manage to blurt out their names and what they were voting for. Tory Stephen Crabb first went down the “no” side while shouting aye, before changing direction and heading for the “aye” side where he promptly said no.It was low comedy performed by a cast of Tory grotesques who couldn’t even manage to observe the basics of physical distancing. As if they believed themselves immune to a disease that had already killed 60,000 people – with a lot of help from their own government – by virtue of their own importance. Some at least had the grace to look slightly ashamed to be participating in this profoundly undemocratic land grab but Maria Miller appeared unrepentant. Until earlier this year, Miller had been chair of the women and equalities committee but was now more than happy to trample all over those whom she used to pretend to care about. How she sleeps at night is anyone’s guess.Unfortunately for the opposition MPs and the handful of Tory MPs with a conscience, they also had to participate in the farce. Not once but twice, as the government had to first see off an amendment tabled by the Tory chair of the procedure committee, Karen Bradley, that proposed to maintain the hybrid status quo until the end of the summer. Some managed to maintain a modicum of good humour first time round, but as the exercise in futility extended towards the 90-minute mark many began to look seriously pissed off and their votes were cast with a definite edge in their voice. Kevin Brennan spat out the words “Mogg shambles”.Then the voting merely reflected the nature of the debate. Only this time we were seeing the “one rule for the elite, another for the rest of us” enshrined in law. It’s government policy for people to still work from home wherever possible, and here was Jakey and the rest of the cabinet actively making it impossible for MPs to work from home. If the government can treat its co-workers that badly, just imagine the contempt it has for the rest of us. Lou Reed had it about right. Give me your hungry, your tired, your poor I’ll piss on them. Your poor huddled masses, let’s club them to death.But it was all just water off Jakey and Boris’s back: Jakey even joked about the similarities to Alton Towers by telling MPs he had taken his sister Stigmata to the theme park. An opportunity for a cynical erosion of parliamentary democracy had been there for the taking and they hadn’t been able to refuse a gift horse. There had to be an upside of the coronavirus somewhere and it could make Brexit a little less hassle. And the donkeys had just gone along with it. From now on, every vote will be a 45-minute conga, with at least a hundred or more MPs effectively excluded. The Tories have effectively taken us from a modern voting system to one that would have been rejected in the Middle Ages.If I was an opposition MP, I’d tell any Tory asking for a pair to sod off. Make them all turn up and pray for the wettest June on record.\u0026nbspLet it rain. Let them get soaked three times a day as the rest of the world sniggers at us.

My assessment is that that’s not very likely – fishing remains an emblematic issue for the government,” said Deas.\u0026nbspHis comments came as the fourth round of Brexit talks about trade and the future relationship between the UK and the EU began on Tuesday.In the past week, both sides have lowered their expectations, saying they think it is unlikely the impasse on fisheries and other issues will be broken.\u0026nbspAt a press briefing, Deas said the industry did not support an extension to the transition period and that skirmishes between English and French fishing leaders would be almost inevitable.\u0026nbsp“France benefits more than anybody else from relative stability from the current quota shares. If there’s any change to that, those quota shares or any other aspect that affects French fishermen, as day follows night there will be blockades, they have done it for much less in the past,” said Deas.He said other countries take “a much more pragmatic” view and recognise that “quota shares will have to change”.“There will be a reaction in France by the fishermen, that’s just the nature of the beast,” he said but added that that was not a reason “not to do what we’re doing” or to extend the transition period.Two years ago, British and French boats clashed in the Channel in what became known as the “scallop wars”.Elspeth Macdonald, the chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation, warned that the French had much to lose if talks break down, with 5,000 jobs in Boulogne dependent on the business.She also pointed out that the fishing industry by value is worth “about £1bn in each direction”. However, this is split by 11 nations, with Ireland, France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and the Netherlands being particularly hit by any reduced access to British waters.Last week, the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he had spoken to 11 fishing ministers and there would be no change to his mandate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26a30baa90235794fa36520a18ecfed3273af321/0_137_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c72fb507d0fe67813b3e2c0af1a542ec","title":"young offenders locked up for over 22 hours a day mps hear","story":"Justice select committee told of damage being done to children during Covid-19 lockdownMPs have been warned it is “unacceptable” that children in young offenders institutions are still being locked up for in excess of 22 hours a day, 10 weeks after lockdown.Many of them have had no access to face-to-face education during that time, the justice select committee hearing on the impact of Covid-19 on the youth justice system was told.The custody estate should have moved more swiftly, and there are now real concerns that young offenders, who had initially accepted the restrictions placed on them, would lose patience if they see changes to lockdown in the community, but no relaxation of regimes in YOIs.Very few children had been released under the early release scheme, the committee heard. Since lockdown, there had been additional evidence of self-harm and increased attempted suicide, which was being tested.“Was it acceptable on 23 March to shut down regime, including education, so that you can assess the situation and start delivering a service safely to children? Absolutely it was,” said Angus Mulready-Jones, the inspectorate of prisons lead for children and young people.“Is it still acceptable, 10 weeks down the line, to be in a position where children across the estate are locked up for in excess of 22 hours a day? No. I think that is not an acceptable position, and the estate needed to have moved quicker.”Findings from four weeks into the coronavirus crisis – around 20 April – discovered that time out of cell was “very poor in the public sector estate”, with the privately-run Parc Prison and young offender institute in south Wales performing “five times better” than Cookham Wood young offender institution, said Mulready-Jones.“Those differences remain today, where Cookham Wood is delivering less than one hour out of cell each day for the children there, whereas Parc in South Wales is delivering closer to four hours out of cell.”He said the key difference was the amount of educational activities on offer. At Parc, provision was more akin to that offered to vulnerable children in the community. “Most children in custody would fit that description , and so in my opinion, custody needed to have moved quicker to deliver education in the sites that it has, particularly those children’s sites.“And, until they deliver adequately some form of education, those regimes will still remain inadequate,” he said.Peter Clarke, chief inspector of prisons, said some YOIs had wanted to introduce face-to-face education after lockdown “but were prevented from doing so because there was central direction”.Clarke added there now needed to be flexibility and the ability to mitigate “the bad effects of long-term isolation, which is what boys in YOIs are experiencing at the moment.”“We have spoken to governors, not only in the YOIs, but wider across the custodials, who are becoming frustrated with their inability to innovate and mitigate at a local level. And, I think it needs to happen.“We are being told now that whilst prisoners and children in YOIs have understood the need for restrictions so far, as they begin to see the situation changing in the community they will lose patience if they don’t see a similar progression, not necessarily at the same pace, but some progression within the custodial state in terms of relaxing regimes,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4d588d7136905952f916162cde28da3b2eaa13f/0_132_4928_2959/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cba40f24ddbf7ac0f4e718bda28ea0ab","title":"record numbers used uk food banks in first month of lockdown","story":"Charities say government support is failing to protect low-income familiesPoverty campaigners have called for an emergency cash support scheme to help struggling low-income households after UK food bank charities reported that the first full month of coronavirus lockdown was their “busiest ever”.The charities said their experience of record food bank use in April, following a huge surge in food aid in March, showed it was clear that current social security safety net measures were not enough to prevent poorer families being swept into destitution.The number of families with children who received food parcels almost doubled in April compared to the the same period last year, the Trussell Trust said, a rise it described as unprecedented.Ifan said half of the 132 food banks it surveyed had expanded operations to cope with rising demand in April, taking on more volunteers and opening more venues. A third had increased the size of inidual food parcels to support people for longer.Trussell Trust chief executive Emma Revie said: “People need to be able to put food on their table. The government must put urgent support in place to ensure people already struggling to keep their heads above water and stay afloat.”Although government emergency measures such as the job retention scheme had helped, many families were already falling through the gaps and more support would be needed when those measures wind down over the coming months, charities said.They called for local authorities to be funded to re-provide emergency cash grants to families through local welfare schemes. Many of these schemes have been drastically reduced or wound up in recent years.This should be implemented alongside a rise in benefit rates for families with children, a suspension of benefit deductions on advance loans given out to cover claimants through the five-week wait for universal credit, and a lifting of the benefit cap.Child Poverty Action Group chief executive Alison Garnham said: “No parent wants to depend on charity to feed their own child but\u0026nbspit is clear that food\u0026nbspbanks are becoming the only option for a growing number of families whose finances have all but collapsed because of Covid-19.\u0026nbspStruggle is turning to real hardship.”Ifan coordinator Sabine Goodwin said: “Our food bank figures paint a grim picture of what is unfolding across the UK and the numbers of people having to resort to emergency food parcels to survive. But the solution to the escalating food insecurity crisis has never been the provision of charitable food aid. Everyone needs to be able to afford to buy food\u0026nbspand the\u0026nbspbare essentials.”\u0026nbspA government spokesperson said: “We understand that this is a difficult time for people on low incomes and we’ve taken significant action to support those affected by coronavirus, including through\u0026nbspincome protection schemes, mortgage holidays and additional support for renters.\u0026nbsp“For those most in need we’ve injected more than £6.5bn into the welfare system, which includes an increase to\u0026nbspuniversal credit of up to £1,040 a year. No one has to wait five weeks for money as urgent payments are available, while some people\u0026nbspmay be eligible for a nine-month grace period where their income is not capped.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56190353dd47ee1ab8d57526d7f013f4a9b0bfcc/0_0_2441_1010/master/2441.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37f9bf541b9073ec3acbf8dd60b3cab3 465w","title":"the great gatsby defies virus with october west end reopening","story":"Play will incorporate face masks and physical distancing into its immersive stagingA vastly reduced capacity and masks that double as PPE are two of the measures put in place by the producers of the immersive theatre piece The Great Gatsby, which is planning to reopen in October, months ahead of predictions for the West End.Hartshorn said: “Gatsby provides you with an easier environment to social distance than at a supermarket. The thing we’re doubling down on is PPE: in Gatsby you’re invited to a party so we’ve made it a masquerade ball which requires a mask, so we’re managing to incorporate that into the show.”The plan is to reopen on 1 October with a capacity of 90, with an additional 10 cast and three crew members. Certain scenes will be cut, including a group charleston for 250 people, and they are experimenting with having an A and B cast, which means if someone presents symptoms of Covid-19 they will have enough actors to keep the show going.“Gatsby lends itself to social distancing between people and they have the agency to move around the space as you see fit as an audience member,” Hook said.\u0026nbspThe action will take place in one large space, with smaller breakout rooms for groups of up to four ticketholders, rather than 20 people pre-Covid-19.The return of The Great Gatsby is a rare positive story for British theatre, which has been completely shuttered because of Covid-19, with many predicting it will be left decimated because of the financial impact. Julian Bird, the chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, said British theatre companies had already lost about £330m because of the lockdown.In early May, the theatre producer\u0026nbspSir Cameron Mackintosh said the lockdown measures imposed because of the Covid-19 outbreak meant West End theatres were unlikely to be able to reopen until 2021. Sonia Friedman, the producer behind West End hits such as The Book of Mormon and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, wrote in the  (paywall) that British theatre was on the “brink of total collapse” and needed an urgent government rescue package.Hartshorn and Hook ssaid immersive theatre’s ability to put on performances in larger spaces meant they were well positioned to be pioneers of the art form’s return as Covid-19 continued to mean many institutions remained closed.“Every single piece of traditional theatre is a massive challenge at the moment,” said Hartshorn. “We produced Amélie, which was nominated for three Olivier awards. The only way we could conceive of that going ahead is moving into a theatre that is three times the size of the one we had planned.”The producers joined the calls for government support and clearer guidelines for venues that are desperate to reopen as soon as possible. “It’s been hard to watch the government not stepping in and saying ‘here’s the plan’,” said Hook. “The Arts Council’s £160m is a drop in the ocean compared to other countries and there are so many cracks for people to fall through.”There have been other innovative attempts to bring theatre back. The\u0026nbspBig House\u0026nbspvenue in north London has announced a socially distanced production and is inviting six audience members at a time to watch the performances of its play The Ballad of Corona V.\u0026nbspThe Old Vic announced last week that Claire Foy and Matt Smith will return in June for a series of “socially distanced performances” of the play Lungs, which will be performed to an empty auditorium and live-streamed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30370d5ac4672cae057cb921312e8f72e59ccc9d/0_207_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d3484974f957c04f805332dc5d5be61","title":"ellie kurttz actors in lockdown in pictures","story":"Throughout theatre’s shutdown, photographer Ellie Kurttz has been taking portraits of creatives remotely, capturing images from video calls.

However the full details of its work for the government are unknown because the published version of the contract was partly redacted.The disclosure comes amid questions from civil liberties groups as to how private companies hired by the government during the pandemic are using confidential data.The unredacted portion of the contract shows that the MHCLG said such work was likely to require data from\u0026nbsp“social media, utility providers and telecom bills, credit rating agencies” as well as from the government, but provides few other specifics.It brings the number of government contracts awarded to Faculty to at least nine in the last two years. The contracts in total are worth at least £1.6m.Three of these contracts relate to the provision of artificial intelligence services to inform government departments attempting to manage the impact of coronavirus.Faculty, which has links to senior Tory figures in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office, declined to say how many contracts it had won in total from the government for work connected to the pandemic, nor how much the contracts were worth.The latest contract was awarded directly to Faculty without other firms being given an opportunity to make a competitive bid. The ministry said there was an “urgent need to bring in additional analytics support to help inform our response to the coronavirus pandemic”.Public bodies have been allowed to award contracts without a competitive tender during the pandemic as ministers believe that private firms need to be hired quickly to deal with the outbreak. The MHCLG contract, entitled “Data scientists for MHCLG Covid-19 response”, was awarded in April and will run until July.The precise details of the company’s work are not entirely clear from the contract, in part because a key passage relating to “three areas where immediate support is required” is blacked out. An MHCLG spokesperson said the withheld information related to datasets held by the ministry that were considered sensitive.“Faculty is helping MHCLG to analyse data in real time allowing the department to monitor the impact of Covid-19 on local communities and respond to emerging issues at pace.”Founded in 2014 as Advanced Skills Initiative, the company rebranded as Faculty in February 2019. It first came to public attention for its work helping the Vote Leave campaign.Dominic Cummings, the chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign and now chief adviser to the prime minister, Boris Johnson, recruited one of Faculty’s data scientists, Ben Warner, to work with him in Downing Street.In April the  revealed that both Cummings and Warner had been attending meetings of Sage, the government’s committee of scientific advisers. It subsequently emerged that Marc Warner, the brother of Ben and the chief executive of Faculty, has also attended.Faculty has previously said that it has “strong governance procedures in place to guard against conflicts of interest when competing for new work. All of its contracts with the government are won through the proper processes and in line with procurement rules.”Faculty has previously received at least two other contracts for work on Covid-19. One of Faculty’s shareholders is the Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew, who owns £90,000 of the company’s shares. He is resisting calls to dispose of the shareholding despite his role overseeing the Government Digital Service, which is responsible for digital procurement.Growing concern about the extent of private involvement in the government’s coronavirus response – and uncertainty surrounding the use of confidential data by tech firms hired by the government – has prompted one campaign group to threaten legal action.The technology campaign group Foxglove said it had asked\u0026nbspthe government for copies of data sharing agreements signed with the companies involved in the government’s “Covid-19 datastore”, including Faculty, in April. Last month the government said it\u0026nbspneeded more time\u0026nbspto decide whether releasing them would unduly damage the companies’ commercial interests.The Scott Trust, the ultimate owner of the , is the sole investor in GMG Ventures, which is a minority shareholder in Faculty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/178552b6c3fbd200c1b5c26b8553c9329ff2dfe0/0_222_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14c5d36a907ed105dab00c669b6a7d0c","title":"grindr dating app removes ethnicity filter to support black lives matter","story":"Feature will not be part of app’s next release following accusations of hypocrisyGrindr is removing an “ethnicity filter” from its dating app as part of its support for the Black Lives Matter movement, the company announced on Monday.The controversial feature, limited to those who stump up £12.99 a month for the premium version of the app, allows users to sort search results based on reported ethnicity, height, weight and other characteristics.In a statement posted to Instagram, the company said “We stand in solidarity with the #BlackLivesMatter movement and the hundreds of thousands of queer people of color who log in to our app every day.“We will continue to fight racism on Grindr, both through dialogue with our community and a zero-tolerance policy for racism and hate speech on our platform.

Many condemned the company’s show of solidarity as hollow when taken alongside the existence of a feature that allows users to explicitly discriminate based on race.The company has\u0026nbsplong maintained that the ethnicity filter\u0026nbspwas useful for minority users who wanted to find people like themselves, rather than enforce racism.“We decided before we were ready to pull the plug on that, it was a conversation we wanted with our user base,” Grindr’s head of communications told the  in 2018. “While I believe the ethnicity filter does promote racist behaviour in the app, other minority groups use the filter because they want to quickly find other members of their minority community.”The announcement came on the first day of Pride month, Grindr noted. “We can still come together in the spirit of Pride, but Pride this year has an added responsibility, a shifted tone, and a new priority that will be reflected in our programming – support and solidarity for queer people of color and the #BlackLivesMatter movement.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb89be772925525dffe4cfd01635221039f00086/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5ca80abb9acf62cc2567b1c4e2f31b5","title":"us senator huawei 5g is like soviets building wests submarines","story":"Tom Cotton tells MPs the US will review intelligence sharing if firm’s kit is usedA Republican senator told MPs that using Huawei kit in 5G phone networks would be akin to allowing Russia to build submarines for western nations during the cold war, in a tense hearing that saw him clash with opposition MPs.Tom Cotton, who represents Arkansas, said he had geopolitical and technical objections to Huawei and claimed that, if hacked, its equipment could track the movements of key parts for F35 fighter jets.Deploying Huawei, the politician continued, “would be as if we had relied on adversarial nations in the cold war to build our submarines, or to build our tanks. It’s just not something that we would have ever considered.”Ten days ago, an increasingly nervous Downing Street said it was reviewing a plan put forward by Boris Johnson as recently as January and indicated that it could be prepared to eliminate Huawei involvement entirely by 2023.Cotton said that he would welcome the UK removing Huawei “even earlier” and argued that the Chinese company’s kit could be targeted by People’s Liberation Army hackers to track the movement of key parts of US F35 fighter aircraft if it were compromised.The senator has recently submitted an amendment to the US\u0026nbsp2021 National Defense Authorization Act that would block the deployment of US air force F35s in countries where Huawei equipment is used, and told the committee “we believe\u0026nbspour airmen could be at risk”.But he was challenged by Kevan Jones, a Labour MP who has sat on the intelligence and security committee. The backbencher said GCHQ had concluded there was no security risk to Anglo-American operations.“There is no way, there’s no evidence at all, that anything, that cooperation between our two nations is going to be compromised in terms of what has been proposed,” Jones said, and accused Cotton of making “threats to try and change policy in UK”.The senator disagreed, saying that the US National Security Council was reviewing intelligence sharing with the UK in the light of the initial Huawei decision, prompting Jones to interrupt. “There’s no way that Huawei equipment will come anywhere near anything in terms of our signals intelligence,” the Labour MP added.Using the cover of parliamentary privilege, Cotton asked Jones “why are you so eager to put a criminal organisation’s technology into your networks” and accused Huawei of supplying technology used by Beijing to suppress China’s Uighur Muslim minority.Huawei says that it is a privately owned company, controlled by an employee trust, which is independent of the state. Its leaders say it has not cooperated with any attempt to orchestrate surveillance\u0026nbspby the communist regime and its technology has been audited as compliant by Britain’s spy agencies.Stewart McDonald, an SNP MP, also challenged Cotton, arguing that the behaviour of Donald Trump, particularly during the George Floyd crisis, adversely affected the United States’s ability to lead on the issue. “The current presidential leadership and, in particular, his style of leadership is grossly undermining,” McDonald said.Speaking after the hearing, Victor Zhang, the vice-president of Huawei, said the hearing demonstrated that the senator’s principal concern was that the company had become too successful in an industry where the US has traditionally dominated.\u0026nbsp“It’s clear its market position, rather than security concerns, underpins America’s attack on Huawei as the committee was given no evidence to substantiate security allegations,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd4507b6870c1fec6ce9200232a615144b878ac3/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81b4cf2257c670d37242e385d1116c19","title":"10 best novels set in portugal saramago monica ali","story":"From a Saramago masterpiece to Monica Ali’s rural blues, via mountains, cities and coast, bookmark this reading list for a flavour of Portugal – and its peopleAwarded the Nobel prize in 1998 for his ability to help us “once again apprehend an elusory reality”, José Saramago is without question Portugal’s most famous literary export. His 1984 novel The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis, set in a prewar fascist Lisbon, is widely considered his masterpiece. For a lighter and more uplifting read, however, my pick would be his 1982 historical romp, Baltasar and Blimunda. Framed by the construction of the Convent of Mafra, a modern-day tourist honeypot, it describes a heretical priest trying to escape the clutches of the Inquisition with the aid of a one-handed former solider (Baltasar) and his X-ray-eyed lover (Blimunda).The second novel is a fantastically tricky accomplishment to pull off and, if the critics are any guide (Goodreads’ gives it an underwhelming 2.75), Monica Ali’s Alentejo Blues falls somewhat flat. Sure, it’s not as electric as Brick Lane, but, as an evocation of rural Portugal, it’s definitely worth a read. Set in and around the village of Mamarrosa, this series of gently unfolding vignettes transports readers into the lives – and minds – of a fictional populace: a disgruntled cafe owner, a wannabe au pair, a squalid English family, a gay pig farmer. Ali is always a joy to read. Skin-deep and stylised as it may be (“this neat, pretty book”, novelist Natasha Walter called it), don’t let that put you off.Originally published in German, Pascal Mercier’s Night Train to Lisbon is a philosophically intense mystery set in the Portuguese capital during the Estado Novo dictatorship from the early 1930s until 1974 mostly under the rule of António Salazar. The protagonist, a Swiss classicist called Raimund Gregorius (played by Jeremy Irons in the 2013 film adaptation), becomes intrigued by some notebooks he stumbles on by a Portuguese doctor called Amadeu de Prado. Amadeu has the misfortune of being obliged to treat the head of Salazar’s secret police. By saving the man’s life, the until-then popular doctor finds his own life upturned. Gregorius’ quest to stitch back the threads of Amadeu’s life provides Mercier with as opportunity to memorably depict Portugal pre- and post-democracy.In another explicit treatment of Portugal’s years of dictatorship, Italian writer Antonio Tabucchi superbly captures the ethical compromises and psychological tensions of living under a fascist regime. The Pereira of the title is a book-loving journalist on the Lisboa newspaper, who, despite his best efforts to keep his head down, finds himself drawn into a web of perilous subversion. Published in 1994, some critics suggest it’s as much a contemporary critique of Italy under Silvio Berlusconi as it is a historical portrayal of Portugal under Salazar. That could be true: as Pereira Maintains reveals, fascism is drearily – and dangerously – similar wherever it takes root.Beguiling and more than a bit bonkers – one of the protagonists, a widowed Canadian diplomat, moves to Portugal with a chimpanzee another insists on always walking backwards – this successor to The Life of Pi serves up another magical Martel fable. The ocean of his Booker-winning debut is swapped here for the terra firma of Portugal over a century-long timeframe. Made up of three, loosely related stories, each section involves the protagonist setting off on a wild goose-chase into the country’s northern hills (“mountains” is a bit of a stretch). These quests all eventually lead to the village of Tuizelo, which, unlike the majority of this fantastical fable, actually exists (note: it is in Montesinho natural park, replete with a “plain and simple” church disarmingly similar to that of Martel’s description).From the capture of Ceuta in 1415 until the handover of Macau in 1999, Portugal can lay claim to having had one of the most enduring empires in world history. Perhaps that’s why the country appears to suffer so little post-colonial angst. Dulce Maria Cardoso’s recent novel The Return shows another less celebrated side of the imperial narrative. After the independence wars in Lusophone Africa of the 1960s and early 1970s, Portuguese evacuees upped and went back to the “motherland” in droves – an involuntary reverse migration that required adjustment on the part of both returnees and recipients. Written in poetic and prescient prose, Cardoso draws on her own experience (she grew up in Angola) to capture the plight of Portugal’s retornados.\u0026nbspPublished in 1941, Miguel Torga’s tautly constructed short stories of life in the barren hills of Portugal’s Trás-os-Montes (literally Over-the-Mountains) region became an instant classic. Ostensibly, life has changed considerably since Torga’s day, the dirt-poor villages of his youth are now blessed with electricity, the internet, running water and paved roads. Yet, as my Portuguese friends are all quick to tell me, the soul of this rustic corner of the country’s hinterland remains much the same. Written in the spare, thrifty prose for which Torga was famous (he was twice nominated for the Nobel prize), Tales from the Mountain offers an unflinching, up-close view of a Portugal where outsiders rarely tread.Considered by many as one of Portugal’s best – if not the best – writer, Eça de Queiroz survives as a staple in the Portuguese canon. Famed for his realist depictions of 19th-century life (he died in 1900), his satirical account of Portugal’s decadence – The Illustrious House of Ramires – is both hilarious and savage at the same time. For a more positive spin on Portugal, try his posthumous romance The City and the Mountains, which is set between Paris (affluent, yet vacuous) and the Douro valley (impoverished, yet enchanting). That said, if your lockdown luggage allows for only one Eça de Queiroz title, then it has to be his 1888 masterpiece, The Maias. A stalwart of the school syllabus (and superbly translated by Margaret Jull Costa), the novel tells the story of Portugal’s incestuous bourgeoisie society through the decline and fall of a high-flying, ill-fated Lisbon family.\u0026nbsp This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

First, precisely measure out 12 teams, each consisting of two chefs, then serve up in two batches of six. Any more that that, and it becomes impossible to remember the contestants’ faces, let alone invest emotionally in their “gelatine control” technique.\u0026nbspNext, carefully fold in a pair of judges – Cherish Finden and Benoit Blin – who are as exacting as they are eccentric then finish off with the able, amusing presenting duo of comedian Tom Allen and former GBBO contestant Liam Charles. Some may find the cheesy preshow presenters’ sketch (a leftover from Mel and Sue’s day) overpowers other flavours, but that’s a matter for personal taste.The fifth series (the third on Channel 4) continued this week with a miniatures challenge that was ideal for any chefs given to cryptic self-expression. They had been tasked with making 24 identical millefeuilles, constructed from puff pastry and at least two crème pâtissière-like fillings, plus 24 illusion desserts. The latter, in Benoit’s words, should be “in the shape of an egg, but taste nothing like one”.Some of the more intriguing efforts included Lexington Catering’s chocolate-based take on Chinese delicacy “century eggs” (“More like three-and-half-hour eggs” quipped Liam) and Park Plaza hotel’s yolk made from a curd of sea buckthorn. No, me neither, but team leader Domenico informed us that it tastes “like a kumquat, but more sour”, which regular kumquat-quaffers will no doubt find very descriptive.\u0026nbspIt’s not just the ingredient lists that are telling, though. This format allows us to get to know the inidual contestants in context as team members and, in some cases, bosses or skivvies. For all that The Professionals is often unfavourably compared with GBBO in its 2013-16 prime, or the more instantly appealing Junior Bake Off, it does bring to the table a deeper understanding of cookery science. And not just the chemistry bit, the psychology bit too.Teams with a traditional chefsous-chef hierarchy can perform extremely well – the frontrunners so far, Domenico and Alessandra, have this dynamic – but it’s the more equal partnerships that seem to demonstrate the most resilience in the face of setbacks. Does the solidarity engendered by Ryan and Clanny’s matching barbershop fades (last week they had stars shaved in this week it’s diamonds) contribute to The Ivy’s ability to bounce back from disappointment? Is Andrew and Ian’s non-stop pop music punning the secret of The Lounge’s unshakable morale? As ever, the proof is in those puddings.\u0026nbspOr rather, in this case, the avian-themed pièce montée that they were instructed to make as this week’s showpiece challenge. Having managed only eight illusion eggs out of the requested 24, proud Lancastrians Andrew and Ian decide to “bring some northern attitude” and redouble their efforts overnight. They also shrewdly declined to specify the bird species that would be perched atop their ambitious tower of nougatine and Paris-Brest choux pastries: “Sometimes it’s a swan, sometimes it’s a dove … sometimes it’s a penguin,” Andrew coyly told the judges.That was actually among the more structurally sound of these constructions. Tracy and Moos, nougatine novices, decided to make their entire swan from the tricky, brittle stuff, while Domenico’s addition of cappuccino flavouring to the classically French Paris-Brest risked provoking Benoit’s patriotic indignation: “So we go to Brest, but with a small detour via Roma?”The final five minutes is always a tense montage of trembling hands, sweating foreheads and swaying sugar-work, but this episode culminated in the almost unbearable tension of each team attempting to relocate their pièce montée from the work surfaces to the judging table without it crashing to the floor. As a glum Kristine commented: “It’s literally whose is gonna fall apart first, isn’t it?”Indeed, isn’t that what Bake Off: The Professionals is really all about? Not who makes the most most impressive edible structure, but who most effectively manages their stress throughout the painstaking process? Some people are cortisone-powered perfectionists, driven to excellence by their own nerves, while others own a cooling rack and know how to use it. The fact that many of us at home have also spent the last few months baking the pain away only makes these insights that much more timely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5aa04a8d7a31987ee996a7b35b011c7503f84fc/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4daa276ed14f966a6eaf43da2cf171a2","title":"less less less how the miniseries took over tv","story":"From Quiz to Chernobyl, the one-off television series is the perfect antidote to the relentlessness of multi-season shows.

In the groundhog day mood of lockdown, their blink-and-you’ll miss-them nature perhaps felt even more vital, a few brief moments of connection to the outside world as everyone hunkered down in separate living rooms.There have, of course, long been serials on TV, from Roots to Band of Brothers. However, “miniseries” or “limited series” (the preferred term in the US) have come into their own in the highly competitive streaming age, where attention s are ever-shorter, and a self-contained narrative – whether three or 12 episodes long – is often the “Goldilocks” option when compared with hasty one-offs or eight-series fantasy epics, which might end in disappointment.Previously merged with the movies category and also featuring single seasons of longer shows, today the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series heaves with one-series wonders recent contenders have included Netflix’s When They See Us, The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, and Fargo. Writing in 2016, Kaitlyn Tiffany of US entertainment site The Verge described miniseries as a way for networks “to take creative risks, pushing the medium forward even if a particular show doesn’t become a zeitgeist-dominating TV event like Breaking Bad or The Sopranos”.\u0026nbspAnd yet, a mere four years later, miniseries are at the heart of TV viewing, rather than hors d’oeuvres in our viewing diets. Chernobyl is a case in point as well as winning in the Emmy Limited Series category last year, it scooped awards for every other category available to a limited series, bar supporting actor. Once made up of a hodgepodge of TV movies and a single series (see Downton Abbey in 2010), the Limited Series category was no more cogent than ever. And the hits seem unlikely to stop anytime soon. Hot on the heels of the Netflix documentary smash Tiger King (itself a limited series), it has been announced that Nicolas Cage will play its protagonist, Joe Exotic, in a separate eight-part show. Meanwhile, Anna Delvey, the Robin Hood “heiress”, who scammed half of New York, is also the subject of an upcoming Netflix miniseries, Inventing Anna, created and produced by Shonda Rhimes.\u0026nbsp“The actors on these shows are either incredibly famous or you’ve never seen them before in your life. I also really love the filmmaking aspect of it – I love really well-shot, well-lit programmes, and these are almost like movies because they’re more contained. The producers are putting that effort in to make something stand on its own, too – they’re like, we have six episodes to say everything we want to say. In other shows they’re not thinking of quality, they’re thinking of quantity.”The success of programmes like Sharp Objects, Big Little Lies and Little Fires Everywhere also highlights a growing part of the miniseries ecosystem: book-to-TV adaptations. “The development of and investment in miniseries for TV has seen a real boom in the sale of film and TV rights”, says Juliet Mushens, literary agent and CEO of London-based agency Mushens Entertainment. “The space was dominated by film for quite a long time, but in more recent years I have seen a real increase in TV production companies acquiring book rights – even in competitive situations.”Big names both in front of and behind the camera, says Mushens, can “make them more attractive to authors – and of course they have a positive impact on book sales, too.” From Mushens’s roster, Jessie Burton’s The Miniaturist and The Feed by Nick Clark Windo have been adapted for TV, with Chernobyl director Johan Renck in talks to work on bringing her title Girl A by Abigail Dean to the small screen with Sony’s 3000 Pictures.But what happens when audiences want more than a limited run can offer? Following the huge success of Normal People, which broke records for BBC iPlayer in April, rumours have abounded of a second series following starcrossed Irish lovers Marianne and Connell. While these remain unsubstantiated, director Lenny Abrahamson has said that he has “a fantasy of ... you know, seeing where they are in 10 years’ time sort of thing”. The miniseries, then, perhaps cynically, could be seen as the ultimate winwin for broadcasters if a show is a hit it can be extended without any prior commitment, while, if it fails, there are no further decisions to be taken.\u0026nbspSimilarly, while there have been calls for a second series of HBO’s hugely successful Watchmen adaptation, its creator Damon Lindelof has said he won’t continue with the show, though he would hand it over to someone else: “Unless you’re compelled to say something new, I don’t think that you should do it just because you did it once successfully.”\u0026nbspIt seems, then, that while miniseries are hugely popular, they can also be a halfway house for programme makers trying to cater to an ever-changing world where commitment isn’t guaranteed, and where TikTok is as much of a competitor as a rival channel. But, when done correctly, they are perhaps the best kind of television: the sort that leaves you wanting more, while also not needing it. And, at the very worst, unlike Game of Thrones, you won’t have watched 60 episodes to get there.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f30d61f105e79067c40e00322d4b18e979a99e2/120_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b8c34494b00c8a8156720ed3b33ee07f","title":"share your coronavirus contact tracing experiences with us","story":"Whether you are a contact tracer or have taken part in the scheme, we would like to hear from youOn Thursday 25,000 new contact tracers started speaking to those with coronavirus and tracing people they have come into close contact with over the past two weeks.

It was not until 20 January that China confirmed coronavirus was contagious and 30 January that the WHO declared a global emergency.“We’re going on very minimal information,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, an epidemiologist and the WHO technical lead for Covid-19, according to the AP. “It’s clearly not enough for you to do proper planning.”The report comes amid growing international scrutiny of China’s handling of the outbreak and moves to establish an independent investigation into the origins of the virus, which has infected more than 6 million and killed more than 375,000 people around the world.The World Health Organization (WHO) was founded as the UN global health body in 1948 in the aftermath of the second world war with a mandate to\u0026nbsppromote global health,\u0026nbspprotect against infectious disease and to serve the vulnerable.\u0026nbspIts current programme envisages expanding universal healthcare to a billion more people, protecting another billion from health emergencies and providing a further billion people with better health and wellbeing.The WHO acts as a clearing house for investigation, data and technical recommendations on emerging disease threats such as the coronavirus and Ebola. It also supports eradication of existing diseases such as malaria and polio and promotes global public health.While its role on emerging diseases is most familiar in the developed world, its practical involvement is far more marked in the global south, where it has been working to expand basic healthcare, support vaccination and sustain weak and often stressed health systems through its emergencies programmes.\u0026nbspTrump has presented the\u0026nbspfreezing of US funding to the WHO\u0026nbspas a direct response to what he claims was its slow reaction in raising the alarm over the global threat from the coronavirus and being too “China-centric” in its response. The allegation that the WHO was slow to warn of the risk of human-to-human transmission, and that it failed to cross-examine Chinese transparency early on, is largely not borne out by the evidence. And the organisation’s funding was already in his sights on 7 February,\u0026nbspwhen his administration was suggesting cutting the US contribution\u0026nbspby half.The WHO has been criticised for consistently lauding China, even as questions emerged over the suppression of early warnings and information. The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has praised China for “setting a new standard for outbreak response” in its swift and aggressive measures.The WHO’s office in China did not respond to a request for comment on the recordings. It said in a statement, reported by the AP: “Our leadership and staff have worked night and day in compliance with the organisation’s rules and regulations to support and share information with all member states equally, and engage in frank and forthright conversations with governments at all levels.”In early January, Michael Ryan, the WHO’s chief of emergencies, said he feared a repeat of the Sars epidemic in 2002, which Chinese officials initially covered up.“This is exactly the same scenario, endlessly trying to get updates from China about what was going on,” he said, according to the AP report. “The WHO barely got out of that one with its neck intact given the issues that arose around transparency in southern China.”Ryan criticised China for not cooperating and advised for applying more pressure on Beijing. “This would not happen in Congo and did not happen in Congo and other places,” he said, apparently referring to the Ebola outbreak. “We need to see the data. It’s absolutely important at this point.”Warnings and reports of a mysterious Sars-like virus began to filter out of Wuhan city in December but were suppressed by authorities. On 9 January, Chinese state media announced the illness was the result of a new coronavirus but said it was not contagious.Almost two weeks later, officials admitted the virus was transmittable, as hospitals in the city were already flooded with patients and cases were appearing across the region. Authorities locked down Wuhan on 23 January, but at least 5 million residents had left, travelling across the country as well as overseas before the lunar new year holiday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2618ac23bf0c6ccbdef2b38e2a11855","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance 2 june midnight","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:According to researchers from Johns Hopkins University, at least 6,339,005 people are known to have been infected, while at least 378,266 are known to have died since the outbreak began.The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and recording regimes, as well as suspected underreporting.A senior US army vaccine researcher says it is reasonable to expect that some sort of vaccine could be available to some parts of the US population by the end of the year. The US defence secretary, Mark Esper, has promised Washington will collaborate with the private sector to produce a vaccine to treat US citizens and partners abroad in 2020.Iran\u0026nbspconfirms its\u0026nbspsecond\u0026nbsphighest number of new cases in a 24-hour period\u0026nbspsince its outbreak began, with the country’s health ministry saying 3,117 people have tested positive.

The worldwide travel warning still applies.

Last Saturday, there were just 21.Across the three flights that took off, that means an average of seven passengers. Gatwick says that the figure – even lower than the 24 initially reported – is an outlier, but with a typical day currently falling anywhere between 100 and 400 passengers, the airport remains a ghost town.Just seven flights were scheduled at the airport on Tuesday, to and from Jersey, Dublin, Kingston, and Sofia. At about 2pm, in one major thoroughfare that normally bustles with passengers, staff and whiteboard-wielding cab drivers, there were six people, or one-fifth the number of hand sanitiser stations.Even stranger than the emptiness was the silence: with almost no passengers, the usually ubiquitous tannoy announcements had been muted completely.As the lockdown begins to lift, the desertion of Gatwick is a reminder of the vast challenges that remain for the aviation sector, with the announcement of a 14-day quarantine period from 8 June, and continuing advice to only travel when necessary, meaning that services will be restored at a glacial pace.\u0026nbspThe airport fears that the quarantine rules will have “a significant impact on our ability to restart”, a spokesperson said, adding that the airport would be lobbying for the guidelines to be regularly reviewed.In the meantime, a single branch of Boots is all that remains of the usually rich retail offer. There were no queues. “I’ve got no idea how long it’s been like this now, honestly,” a cashier said. “One day just merges into another.”\u0026nbspIn an even quieter corner, a man with no plans to travel was being told to stop using the free internet and go home. “If you come back within 24 hours you are liable to be arrested,” a bored-sounding police officer said. “You can’t just come here to get online. This is not an internet hub.” He paused, then added: “I appreciate it isn’t particularly busy.”Sarah, who asked that her last name not be used, had just returned from Jersey, on the first Blue Islands flight into Gatwick since lockdown began. She had been stranded after visiting home for Mother’s Day. “I kind of preferred being there,” she said, adding that the tiny propeller plane she had come back on had been packed, with no gaps between passengers but precautions including masks for all and no cabin service. “But with things starting to get more normal I had to come back for work.”\u0026nbspJason Harris was one of those headed the other way, having secured permission from the island’s immigration service and facing a coronavirus test on arrival, followed by two weeks in isolation if the result was positive.\u0026nbspA teacher who had been stranded on a trip back to his South Wales home, he was unable to delay his journey any longer if he was to be back in time for the restart of school.\u0026nbsp“When I left, there were 10 of us on the plane, the airport and the station were dead – it was quite upsetting,” he said. “I thought it would feel different coming back – but going through the station again today, and it was still dead – it was upsetting again.”Pharmacist Zahar Ali was going to Jersey from her home in Brighton, having volunteered to help fill an urgent staff shortage on the island.\u0026nbsp“I just thought … why not?” she said, as she smoked a cigarette next to the drop-off zone (one police car, three empty airport vehicles, nothing else). “It’ll be different. But it’s really strange being here, it’s normally so packed.”Although staff appear to heavily outnumber passengers, the underlying figures are devastating, says Unite regional officer Jamie Major.\u0026nbsp“So many businesses are dependent on the decisions the airlines take,” he said. “It’s a massive chain of dominos. For every plane taking off, it’s got to be cleaned, catered, ground-handled, the bags have to be screened – and it’s not happening.”The local area, where 36,000 jobs rely on the airport, is likewise in limbo. “The truth is you don’t really notice the flights one way or another when you’ve grown up around Crawley,” says the local Labour council leader, Peter Lamb. “But to some extent it’s a bit unnerving because it is so quiet. We all have friends and relatives who work in aviation.”While the area has been somewhat insulated from the airport’s struggles by the government’s furlough scheme, Lamb fears that many people are yet to understand the extent of the impact that lies ahead.\u0026nbsp“The big problem is that the public don’t think it’s going to happen,” he said. “I don’t think they’ve woken up to the reality that what’s been the most significant part of local industry isn’t going to be viable for a decade.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cd3ab487ae54c7eea8b0308ede10f21d3a33ce9/0_0_4107_2464/master/4107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18b8aa4cc967fdcd893f000514f8b0c1","title":"global report germany eases travel ban cafe culture returns paris","story":"Elsewhere, Italy’s president warns Covid-19 ‘is not over’, and former UK PMs join calls for a coordinated global responseGermany lifted its blanket European travel ban as coronavirus lockdowns across the EU continued to ease, with officials saying new cases in western Europe were now in steady decline.Parisians reclaimed their cafe terraces and Berliners took back their bars as normal life inched closer to returning in many parts of the continent.Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said his government was maintaining its travel warning for non-European destinations, but from Wednesday it would issue inidual advice for all Schengen-zone countries to allow holidaymakers to decide where they could safely travel this summer.In the French capital, contented customers sat outside cafes in the French capital and sipped their morning espressos for the first time in 11 weeks, while bars, casinos, fitness studios and dance schools all reopened in Germany’s biggest city.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.There were, however, strict rules: Parisian bars and restaurants have been given permission to sprawl across pavements but tables must be a metre apart. In the rest of France, customers can now be served inside while maintaining the same distance.In Berlin, gyms must guarantee a 3-metre distance between customers, while bars can only serve at the table, not the counter. Customers in most establishments must give their name and phone number so they can be contacted in case of infection.France’s Covid-19 tracking app, StopCovid, was due to be released at midday but was delayed by technical issues. The app, developed independently of Apple and Google, should allow anyone diagnosed with Covid-19 to warn those with whom they have been in contact in the previous two weeks so they can be tested.The World Health Organization said new cases of Covid-19 were falling steadily in western Europe but rising in hotspots in Russia and eastern Europe. Russia, where deaths exceeded 5,000 on Tuesday, announced a $72bn recovery plan to over the next two years.In Italy, the president, Sergio Mattarella, warned on the country’s national day that, contrary to some recent statements, the coronavirus crisis “is not over, and institutions and citizens alike will still have to face its consequences and trauma”.Speaking a day after Alberto Zangrillo, the head of Milan’s San Raffaele hospital, caused a furore by claiming the\u0026nbspvirus\u0026nbspno longer existed in Italy, Mattarella said it would be “unacceptable and unforgivable to squander this legacy of sacrifice and pain”.Underlining the risk of local spikes in infections as restrictions ease, authorities said gatherings of extended families in the city of Göttingen, north-west\u0026nbspGermany,\u0026nbsptwo weekends ago had led to 68 people contracting the virus and 300 ordered to self-isolate for 14 days.Spain’s health ministry has reported no new Covid-19 deaths for a second consecutive day. However, it also said there had been 34 deaths across\u0026nbspthe country over the past week, leading to some confusion.Fernando Simón, the head of Spain’s centre for health emergencies, said the death figures were “yielding some problems” but added that the numbers were provided by the country’s regional governments.\u0026nbspTo date, the country has registered 27,127 deaths and 239,932 cases.Worldwide, coronavirus has infected more than 6,300,000 people, according to Johns Hopkins University trackers, and killed more than 375,000.A group of more than 230 former world leaders, global health experts and economists called on the\u0026nbspG20\u0026nbspto convene an urgent summit to provide a “strongly coordinated global response” to what they described as an unprecedented global crisis.Noting poorer countries were most at risk, they demanded the developed world release 76 countries from debt payments, double the World Bank’s emergency aid fund and honour billions of dollars committed to Covid-19 vaccine efforts.“The consequences of not acting now would be felt for the rest of the decade,” said the signatories, who included the former UK prime minsters Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, Helen Clark of New Zealand and the ex-UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon.In other developments:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/821d7b535c6f8eb3ad718ef3b286522af2bc87f9/0_140_3104_1863/master/3104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6e9c44a068756fb5c6cb5ccf5169408","title":"valencia criticise atalanta coach who attended match with covid 19","story":"Gian Piero Gasperini admits he had symptoms prior to Champions League match in Spain The Spanish football club Valencia has criticised\u0026nbspthe coach of Italian team Atalanta for “putting the health of numerous people at risk’’ after confessing he had symptoms of Covid-19 prior to the Champions League match between the two sides in March.In an interview with the Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport, Gian Piero Gasperini admitted he was very sick the day before the second leg match in Valencia on 10 March, which took place behind closed doors, but that he was afraid to go to a hospital as they were overflowing with Covid-19 patients at the time.Atalanta is based in Bergamo, one of the cities in Italy hardest hit by Covid-19. The first leg Champions League match between the two clubs, on 19 February, in Milan,\u0026nbspis thought to be among the main factors that contributed to an escalation of cases in Italy’s worst-affected province\u0026nbspand has been described as the\u0026nbsp“biological bomb”\u0026nbspthat turned the north of the country into the centre of the country’s outbreak.That day, about 40,000 football fans from Bergamo travelled the 30 miles (50km) to Milan’s San Siro stadium to watch Atalanta beat Valencia 4-1.“I was afraid,” Gaperini said. “The day before the match in Valencia I wasn’t well the afternoon of the match I felt even worse. The following two nights after the match, I didn’t sleep much. I didn’t have a fever, but I felt miserable, as if I had a fever of 40 degrees. Ambulances went by every two minutes. The hospital was nearby. I was as if we were at war. At night, I thought: ‘If I end up there, who knows what will happen to me?’ I can’t leave now, with so much to do …”“If you look at the pictures, I did not look good on the bench,” he added.An antibodies test carried out 10 days ago confirmed Gasperini had contracted the virus.In a statement on Monday, the Spanish club said: “Following the statements made by the Atalanta coach, Gian Piero Gasperini, Valencia FC wishes to publicly express its surprise over the fact that the coach of the rival team has admitted that he knew he apparently had symptoms compatible with the coronavirus on both the day of the match played in Mestalla – which Atalanta won 4-3 – and the day before. And yet he took no preventive measures, thereby potentially putting the health of numerous people at risk during both his journey to, and stay in, Valencia.”“It should be remembered,” it added, “that this game was played behind closed doors in accordance with the strict measures put in place by Spanish health authorities to prevent the risk of Covid-19 transmission, especially in the case of people coming from an area that had already been declared a public risk zone.”Italy has the third highest coronavirus death toll in the world, with more than 33,000 deaths.Gasperini said he self-isolated for three weeks at Atalanta’s training ground after the trip to Valencia and respected social distancing with his family.Like Italy, Spain has been particularly hard hit by the virus. To date, there have been 239,638 cases and 21,127 deaths.However, the country’s strict lockdown, which has been in force since 14 March, has succeeded in containing the virus. On Monday, Spain reported no Covid-19 deaths over the previous 24 hours for the first time since the beginning of March. The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has said he will seek congress’s approval for a sixth and final extension of the state of emergency, which will expire on 21 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2463b9b9fd633a45d76f2f1b6aea1f5911d1c837/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd7fbd43f65e8729ebfbd70416d21fca","title":"we cant relax europeans face up to life after lockdown","story":"From Spain to Denmark, even those who have coped with coronavirus are aware the world has changed dramaticallyHer customers may be back and there are, miraculously, more of them. Spring is here the sun is out. No one wants to dwell on what happened everyone wants to pick up their lives again, same as before.“But still,” says Sophie Fornairon, “things have changed.”As the countries of continental Europe emerge, cautiously, step by step and at very different rhythms, from their coronavirus lockdowns, even those who managed to make something of confinement see the world is no longer as it was – and may not be for some time.When France first shut down on 16 March, Fornairon was one of many who believed bookshops like hers could have been kept open safely.Books, she says, “can help at times like this. They can deliver answers and provide peace. They lift you out of the everyday and away from the moment. They transport you to other worlds. They are anti-fear. But not everyone has them at home, and the libraries were shut. So I started delivering, on foot.”A good bookseller, she says, is not unlike a doctor – which, until five years ago when she opened her Paris bookshop, La Librairie du Canal, is what she was: a transplant specialist at the nearby Hôpital St-Louis. “A book,” she says, firmly, “has a therapeutic function.”In 55 days of France’s lockdown, Fornairon and her trolley delivered 2,000 packages of books, to loyal customers keen to keep her in business and an expanding list of new ones. “They wanted all sorts,” she says. “Children’s, science fiction, classics: La Peste, War and Peace, The Odyssey, Proust. Teach yourself: a language, or music.”It was exhausting but it saved her business, bringing in half what the small bookshop would usually earn and allowing her to pay the rent and bills. And since non-essential stores reopened in France from 11 May, it has brought her, wholly unexpectedly, many more customers than she had before.“It’s like people have suddenly seen the value of the local bookshop,” Fornairon says. “People who once shopped on Amazon are coming to us because we offer proximity, contact, community, advice. We are cultural mediators. They like it.”Will it last? Sadly, she is not sure. Understandably, Fornairon says, no one yet wants to acknowledge “just how massive the coming economic crisis is going to be. Right now, all might seem fine. But this is just the beginning.”More than 500 miles away in Berlin, DJ Alessio Armeni – stage name Freddy K – is concerned for the future too. A fortnight before the German capital’s nightclubs closed on 13 March, Armeni played the 12-hour final set at Berghain, Berlin’s celebrated temple for electronica lovers, starting at 1am on Sunday night.But authorities had already identified two clubs, Trompete and Kater Blau, as Covid-19 hotspots. “In Berlin, clubs actually started to shut their doors before the authorities made them because they wanted to protect their guests,” he says. “This city may cherish freedom and fun, but with an incredible sense of responsibility.”The DJ worked assiduously throughout the lockdown, playing a daily live techno set for a radio station and contributing to United We Stream, an online fundraising initiative that has so far raised more than €475,000 (£420,000) for struggling venues in a city that sees clubs as “something of cultural value that’s important to the city”.But while Berlin’s bars and restaurants began reopening on 15 May, clubland remains in limbo, with no timetable for its return. In the long run, Italian-born Armeni says, nightclubs simply serve too primal a function to be replaced by live streams.“You can just about imagine people dancing in front of their laptops,” he says. “But for me, DJing is about finding a connection with a crowd. I miss the surge of adrenaline when that happens. I miss the smell, the sweat, the eye contact.”For now, Berlin’s partygoers had been respectful of distancing rules. “But politicians need to give us a prospect for the future soon,” he says, “or you’re going to get illegal raves in the forests.”A thousand miles away in Spain, Joan Guerola hopes all can learn from what has happened. Under Spain’s staggered lockdown loosening rules, from 11 May the parish priest of Sant Miquel de Deltebre-La Cava in Catalonia has been able to hold masses for a third of his parishioners. Since 25 May, half may come in.But during the peak of one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns, Guerola resorted to less orthodox pastoral methods.In Holy Week, the 42-year-old clambered aboard a flatbed truck decked out with a huge picture of Jesus, a loudspeaker and a makeshift altar to deliver mobile blessings. “People couldn’t come to church on Holy Thursday, so I took the blessed sacrament to them,” he says.The past two months have entailed other significant, if less dramatic, changes. Masses have been broadcast on YouTube or Facebook. But technology cannot yet replace physical presence: Guerola has taken communion to old people who have no internet, and tended to the sick and the dying.“When I’ve had to administer the last rites, instead of anointing with my hands I’ve done it with the little wooden sticks doctors use,” he says. “Communion has been with gloves and a mask. The main thing has just been being there.”The past few months, he believes, have offered lessons to everyone, whatever their beliefs – or lack of them. “I think this has shown you should live life day-by-day,” he says. “And it’s a reminder never to put off till tomorrow what you can do today. You never know how things could turn out.”On the Danish island of Fyn, lockdown came so fast on 12 March that Claire Astley, a primary school teacher whose father is English, had no time to even say goodbye to her classes. Her last two pupils returned last week, marking the end of a long journey back to a new normality.When a batch of chicks hatched in the incubator at the back of Astley’s classroom, two went straight to 10-year-olds with a parent in a risk group. “They each have a friend they can share a chick with,” she explains. “They can only touch one other person, because they have to be careful.”The return of those final two pupils – only made possible by their parents isolating from them at home – came a full five weeks after most of the rest of their classmates were among the first of Europe’s pupils to go back to school, on 15 April.Lockdown, by contrast, happened disturbingly fast, from one day to the next. “We started with having Zoom meetings just once a week, because nobody knew how to use it,” says Astley.But while the school is now back, its half-day regime is one of many changes. Instead of moving between three classes, Astley has just one shared 24-pupil group. Half sit in the assembly room and half in the classroom, enabling two metres between desks. Teachers meet to plan online, despite being in adjacent classrooms.“It’s a very strange feeling,” Astley said. “Being with people, but not being able to be ‘there’, you know? So you’re all the time checking yourself. ‘Am I allowed to do this? Am I not allowed to do this?’ And for the kids, obviously that’s stressful too.”\u0026nbspFor many pupils, it has worked.\u0026nbspAs well as the chicks, the class has had a tadpole project, made beads, and staged a marble Olympics. Others, though, have struggled. “Children who like their structure find it a bit exhausting,” she says.Exhausting – and still alarming – is what the past few weeks and months have been for Enzo Lattuca, at 32 one of Italy’s youngest mayors and in office for just seven months when the pandemic struck Cesena, a city of 100,000 in the hard-hit Emilia-Romagna region. His concern now is a possible second wave.“The easiest part was getting people to comply with the lockdown rules,” Lattuca says. “The difficult part was knowing how to manoeuvre in such an unknown context, where we were unable to say how long it would last or how serious it would be. We just had to … keep going.”In a region that suffered more than 4,000 deaths – the second highest toll in Italy – the real battle was fought by medical workers, Lattuca says. At the peak of the pandemic, his city alone was was registering between 40 and 50 cases a day.But his job was not easy. During confinement, “staying close to citizens, answering their questions – even if their problem was minor, like ‘where can I take my dog for a pee?’ – was so important.”In the run-up to 4 May, when restrictions began to be ease, Lattuca had to find face masks for everyone. After 18 May, when bars, restaurants and shops began reopening, he faced young people gathering in groups outside bars. But for the most part, Lattuca says, people are acting cautiously.“They are enthusiastic about trying to get back some normality, but they’re doing it intelligently. We’ve had zero cases for a week now, but they are still paying attention. We can’t relax. We need to be prepared for a second wave. Because next time, we won’t have any excuses.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5655eaedb689bbd6c88b5466e921fa3e7771a23b/0_359_5411_3248/master/5411.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=47e6edad2e6835ff1d0f532a9687c075","title":"cyclone nisarga india evacuates 100000 as mumbai braces for historic storm","story":"First cyclone in 70 years for financial capital sparks rush to transfer Covid-19 patients and sanitise temporary sheltersAt least 100,000 people including coronavirus patients were being moved to safety as India’s west coast braced for a cyclone – the first such storm to threaten Mumbai in more than 70 years.Authorities in India’s financial capital, which is struggling to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, evacuated nearly 150 virus patients from a recently built field hospital to a facility with a concrete roof as a precautionary measure, officials said on Tuesday.The chief minister of Maharashtra state, Uddhav Thackeray, of which Mumbai is the capital, said people living in flimsy homes near the shore were being moved to safer places before Cyclone Nisarga made its scheduled landfall later on Wednesday.“Slum-dwellers … in low-lying areas have been instructed to evacuate,” Thackeray’s office wrote on social media.In Maharashtra’s Palghar district more than 21,000 villagers were being evacuated, local media reported, citing officials.Mumbai has rarely faced the brunt of cyclones. The last severe storm to hit the city struck in 1948, killing 12 people and injuring more than 100.Indian meteorologists have warned of heavy rainfall, with winds of 100-110kmh (60-70mph) and gusts of up to 120kmh capable of damaging thatched huts and power lines. Storm surges of one to two metres (3-6ft) could inundate low-lying areas of Maharashtra.Nisarga was also expected to hit the neighbouring state of Gujarat with nearly 79,000 people to be evacuated from coastal regions by Wednesday morning, the Gujarat relief commissioner Harshad Patel said.Patel said 18 districts across the state would experience heavy rainfall and strong winds of up to 110kmh.“In wake of the coronavirus outbreak all standard operating procedures are being followed at the temporary shelters which have been sanitised and instructions have been issued on following safe distancing,” said Arpit Sagar, an official in Valsad.Nisarga comes on the heels of Cyclone Amphan which killed more than 100 people when it hit eastern India and Bangladesh in May, flattening villages, destroying farms and leaving millions without electricity."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Taoiseach tells FG parliamentary party it may be next week before deal is finalisedUnions call for Government to lay out \u0026lsquoclear roadmap\u0026rsquo of just transition from peat productionUnthinkable: Conceivable Future is fostering a personal but \u0026lsquodeeply political\u0026rsquo debate"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutants"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Gardaí have turned away non-locals who tried to visit. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireMany public hospitals are not “fit for purpose” in terms of providing safe distancing required to protect against the spread of Covid-19, the Health Service Executive has warned.Even a “relatively modest spike” in the spread of the disease would have a very significant impact on critical care beds and the wider hospital system, it will on Tuesday tell a Dáil committee.Separately, public health officials are expected to say today that a large-scale acceleration of the easing of restrictions is unlikely given that new cases of the virus are occurring daily.“There were a lot of kites flown over the weekend, but I wouldn’t read a lot into them,” said a senior source, referring to newspaper reports that the roadmap towards the lifting of restrictions could be brought forward substantially.The impact of the easing of phase one measures last month will only become clear later this week, but there is concern that the number of new cases, while small, has increased three days in a row.One further death linked to Covid-19 was reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on Sunday evening. An additional 77 confirmed cases in the State were reported.NPHET will meet on Thursday to consider the impact of phase one and to decide whether to recommend the measures in phase two to go ahead. The Cabinet will decide on Friday whether the roadmap proceeds to phase two as planned on June 8th.SurgeThe delivery of healthcare will proceed in a higher-risk environment where an outbreak or surge could occur “at any time”, until a vaccine or cure for Covid-19 is developed, HSE national director of acute operations Liam Woods will say on Tuesday.Due to underlying capacity issues, now amplified by the need to manage in a post Covid-19 environment, “the only immediate acute options that can provide an occupancy of 80 per cent is the private hospital system,” Mr Woods will tell the Oireachtas special committee on Covid-19.The Government announced on Friday it would not be renewing the current deal with the country’s private hospitals after it runs out later this month, though it will seek to negotiate the use of private capacity in the event of a second wave of coronavirus.Mr Woods will tell the committee the arrangement has delivered “very substantive benefits”, with 7,605 inpatients and 26,007 day cases seen. The private hospitals have also dealt with 24,407 outpatients and provided 35,073 diagnostic tests.Occupancy levels have grown over time, reaching 51 per cent in late May, he will say.As the lockdown is eased, the provision of services in endoscopy, cardiology, urology and orthopaedics are areas of immediate priority, he will say.The waiting list for endoscopies climbed almost 50 per cent between the end of February and the end of April, while the number of people waiting for orthopaedic procedures increased by 41 per cent.According to Mr Woods, the four national screening programmes, which have been suspended under clinical advice since March, can restart only when “certain safety conditions” are met.Tbe private hospitals agreement represents “very poor value for money”, is not working and should be ended “without delay”, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association will tell the committee.Meanwhile, Department of Education officials are due to meet school and parent representatives in the coming days to discuss plans to reopen schools in late August.The outcome of the talks will feed into a detailed roadmap for how schools will be reopened, which is due to be published next week.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Holohan says \u0026lsquowe\u0026rsquore in a good position\u0026rsquo for second phase of reopening to proceedTaoiseach tells FG parliamentary party it may be next week before deal is finalisedClimate expert urges Irish Water to fix decaying system to ease pressure on supplySince April, almost 200 online hearings have taken place as their style and form evolve\u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom literally shaking,\u0026rsquo man tells judge, as he thanks himCases heard by judge sitting in physical courtroom while other parties use videolinkIrish Youth Foundation (IYF) survey show concerns about long-term impact on youthTaoiseach understood to have told TDs Fine Gael will not enter government \u0027at all costs\u0027Council maintenance crews investigate incident in south Dublin villageArlene Foster wants vote to send message to British government of Stormont\u0026rsquos rejection of abortion law enacted at Westminster\u0026lsquoAlmost two months I was stuck.

Photograph: Alan Betson  The Children roaring like tigers and aping the moves of primates in between peals of excited laughter as they wait impatiently to get through the gates of Dublin Zoo has been a sound of an Irish summer for more than 150 years. But it has been absent from 2020 until now.While Covid-19 restrictions have seen a dramatic curtailment in the numbers allowed in, a tightly controlled one-way system and access to all-indoor spaces closed, the zoo’s return was still well able to lift spirits – of staff and visitors.“It’s great to see real people again,” laughed the zoo’s operations manager, Gerry Creighton, as he watched a small and impeccably maintained socially distant queue form outside the gate ahead of its scheduled reopening at 9.30am.Under the Covid rules only those with prebooked tickets are allowed in, and numbers are strictly limited to 500 people in the mornings and a further 500 in the afternoons with the zoo closing for an hour in between the two. The restaurants, shop and Reptile House are all closed.None of the new rules dimmed the anticipation felt by Erin O’Toole and Michelle Leonard who had brought three children from Firhouse after spending much of Sunday morning on the zoo’s website trying to secure the golden tickets.“They are just so excited,” Ms Leonard said, gesturing toward the children roaring like lions at her feet. “And can you blame them? This is the first thing we have been able to do since the lockdown started.”Jason Quinn and Jeanne Doyle had their toddler twin sons with them on a long overdue visit. “They were supposed to come here for their birthday in March but that got cancelled and we ended up getting goldfish for them instead. We are all so excited we can hardly contain ourselves,” she added.Lavinia McClelland from Castleknock was, if anything, even more excited. “When I managed to book the tickets yesterday it was like I’d won a free trip to Dubai,” she told The .Her two-and-a-half year old son “has been asking five times a day every day when he can go back to zoo. It has been so sad. It has been heartbreaking. How can you explain what has been happening to a baby? But now we have this and it fantastic, it is bright light and a sign things are beginning again. This is a gateway to normality.”And then she was through that gateway and into the zoo.Aoife Lattin and her mother, Deirdre, were trying to wake 16-month-old Noah who had nodded off on the journey in from Swords – possibly because his excitement level at the promised of a day out at the zoo had him up very early. His mother and grandmother were pretty happy too.“I am a teacher and would normally be preparing for the State exams today so it is just very surreal to be here,” said the younger Lattin. “It is brilliant and an important step.”The importance of the day was not lost on zoo director Leo Oosterweghel, and he betrayed traces of excitement beneath his normally laconic and impenetrable exterior. “The zoo is part of people’s lives and there is this amazing sense of ownership,” he said.He pointed out that on a warm summer’s day the zoo would “maybe have six or seven thousand people and now will have to keep it to 500 in the morning and 500 in the evenings, but it is a start. This is a trial period, and we have a big site so are very comfortable we can adhere to social distancing rules.”As ever, the animals he cares for were foremost in his thoughts. “They have been very well looked after by the keepers in recent weeks, and there has been this great curiosity when I have walked past them. I think it will take a few weeks for them to settle back into the old normal.”For now we are still in the new normal. “We have been planning and preparing for weeks, and while there are limitations and restrictions, with such small numbers coming people will get a real opportunity to see the animals who are so curious about people now that they will be craning their necks to look back, if they have necks that is.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4269065.1591128545!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government formation talks squeezed on several fronts","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen deputy leader Catherine Martin must decide by this weekend if she will challenge Eamon Ryan for the leadership. Photograph: Eric Luke Some Ministers and senior officials, as well as Opposition politicians involved in the process, privately warn that talks will have to be concluded by next week at the latest. They point to the need to pass votes in the Dáil and Seanad before June 30th or key sections of the Offences Against the State Act – the anti-terrorist and organised crime legislation that governs, among other things, the Special Criminal Court – will lapse. The Act must be reviewed every year and its extension approved by votes in the Oireachtas. Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan is expected to bring the annual review to the Oireachtas next week.Party insiders say it could take up to two weeks for the parties to gain approval from their memberships (which could, of course, decide to reject any deal). If an agreement on a programme for government were to be reached this day next week, that would leave one week at the end of June for the election of a new taoiseach by the Dáil, the nomination of ministers and the passing of the votes on the Offences Against the State Act. In other words, not much wriggle room.Separately, Green Party deputy leader Catherine Martin must decide by this weekend if she will let her name go forward to challenge Eamon Ryan for the leadership of the Green Party. Martin – who is heading the Green negotiating team at the talks – has been approached by some party activists who want her to stand against Ryan, and has said she will consider her options. A contest would not take place until after the conclusion of the government-formation process, one way or another.But what are the chances of agreeing a deal by next week? Insiders vary in their assessments of progress thus far, but while it is clear that significant progress has been made – and agreed documents on a range of policy issues were due to be signed off by the teams on Tuesday night – there are a number of areas where agreement has not yet been reached.Sticking points:\u0026nbspSeven key differences in the talksThe 7 per cent targetThis is the key policy for the Greens, and insiders say the programme will contain a commitment to reduce Ireland’s emissions of greenhouses gases by an average of 7 per cent a year. The Greens have pressed on how exactly this would be achieved and measured, where sticking points remain.Transportplanning This includes a contentious review of the National Development Plan. The Greens are sticking to the requirement to have 10 per cent of the transport budget set aside for cycling and 10 per cent for walking, though have conceded that the budget for roads maintenance should be preserved as a road safety measure.Housing There are major differences on the Land Development Agency, the State body with the remit to develop State lands for housing. The Greens believe such lands should be developed by the State for public housing and oppose lands being sold to private developers.Agriculture Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil’s rural constituencies are wary of the Greens’ influence in this area, and some of the Green proposals have proved particularly problematic – including a requirement that targets be set for the number of hectares of bog to be “rewetted”.State pension age This is primarily a dispute between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. The State pension age is due to increase to 67 next year, and Fianna Fáil says the planned rise should not go ahead and has called for a review of pension policy. It is understood this would also take a wider look at the PRSI system. Fine Gael insists that deferring the eligibility age must go ahead, claiming it would not be prudent to abandon it. It believes transition welfare payments should apply until someone reaches 67. Legislation that would ban forcing people to retire at 65 is also being discussed.Budget and economic issues A session on finance and economic issues over the weekend is said to have been difficult. Green finance spokeswoman Neasa Hourigan sought details on budgetary measures that could be introduced in next autumn’s budget, but both Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Fianna Fáil finance spokesman Michael McGrath pushed back, insisting it was impossible to predict the economic conditions that far ahead given the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Underpinning the parties’ differences, however, are the fears of some Green TDs that the Government will be forced – or choose – to introduce cuts to public spending or tax increases, and that they will be pilloried by critics on the left, especially Sinn Féin, for supporting “austerity”. Fine Gael is also understood to be pushing for a broad commitment to income tax cuts at some point during the government’s term of office if circumstances allow, but Fianna Fáil and the Greens are not keen, with some arguing that such a pledge may never be delivered upon.Direct provision Ending the direct provision system is a key demand of the Greens and a cherished goal of the party membership. Green Party figures say they want an immediate overhaul of the system in advance of it being scrapped entirely, with responsibility for housing those waiting on asylum decisions being passed to Approved Housing Bodies. Green sources are impatient with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael arguments for a phasing out of the direct provision system over a number of years.Catherine Day, a former secretary general of the European Commission, is due to report back to the government later this year on the future of direct provision. Her report is cited by those in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael but the Greens are suspicious of claims that it would take years to abolish the current system.The best news and analysis from the campaign trailStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4268988.1591120910!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hosepipe bans increasingly likely until action taken on dublin leaks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVartry Reservoir water treatment works in Co Wicklow. Water supplies for the greater Dublin area have dropped dramatically during the ‘driest spring since 1837’. File photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireHosepipe bans will become increasingly regular until Irish Water grasps the “nettle” of leakage from decaying pipes in Dublin city, a climate expert has warned.The national water utility has said an imminent hosepipe ban is highly likely as water supplies for the greater Dublin area have dropped dramatically during a period of drought.Water conservation orders restricting use were first introduced in Dublin during the summer of 2018, and later extended to much of Leinster and Munster, to reduce pressure on water supply.Emeritus professor John Sweeney, who specialises in climate research in Maynooth University, said hosepipe bans would become “increasingly regular” if steps were not taken to address pressure on water supply.One of the problems was the huge levels of water lost through leaks in old pipes, particularly in areas such as Dublin city centre.The Dublin region was having its “driest spring since 1837”, which had a massive impact on water supply, Prof Sweeney said.At the same time Irish Water has seen “unprecedented demand” over recent weeks, according to Yvonne Harris, the utility’s head of customer operations.Some 16 water supplies are already classified as at “drought” level, while a further 38 are “pending drought”, Ms Harris told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme.“We feel it is highly likely we will be required to implement a water conservation order,” she added. Ms Harris said on hot days “demand is soaring beyond any previous levels”.Hand-washing hygiene was obviously critical during the coronavirus pandemic, Ms Harris said, but she appealed to the public not to use water for “unnecessary purposes”.Around 40 per cent of water supplied is lost through leaking pipes, between ageing Victorian-era pipes, and also substandard drainage infrastructure in some Celtic Tiger developments. Dublin and surrounding areas would continue to face problems with its water supply until that “nettle is grasped”, Prof Sweeney said.However, the process of tearing up city centre streets to replace older pipes in areas such as Temple Bar would likely see “disruption on the scale of the Luas works,” he said.Such a move would be opposed by groups representing the service industry, which has already taken a huge financial hit due to the coronavirus pandemic.‘Managed process’Adrian Cummings, chief executive of the Restaurants Association of Ireland, said the hospitality industry “is on its knees” and any retrofitting of water pipes “has to be done in a managed process”.Works to replace water mains should focus on residential areas for the foreseeable future, as major disruption to Dublin city centre “would not be welcomed” by businesses, he said.Donal O’Keeffe, chief executive of the Licensed Vintners Association, which represents Dublin pubs, said “no step should be taken that would compromise” the service sector’s recovery.There had also been an “absence” of progress in the Shannon water scheme, Prof Sweeney said, referencing the planned development of a €1.3 billion pipeline to extract water from the river Shannon to address demand in Dublin.Meanwhile, on Tuesday night rainfall was expected to spread from the southeast.The rest of the week is to be much cooler, with Wednesday forecast to be blustery and cloudy. Temperatures in the northwest will be between 11 and 14 degrees, but may reach 20 degrees elsewhere.The showery and cloudy conditions are forecast to continue into Friday and Saturday, with top temperatures of between nine and 14 degrees.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4268752.1591111892!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"luke ming flanagan bares his bottom half to european parliament","story":" MEP Luke Ming Flanagan lived out a remote working nightmare by participating in a European Parliament committee meeting on agriculture in a state of undress.

Obviously at all times we should be trying to get the maximum bang for our buck, “ Mr Flanagan told the committee from the bed as he rubbed his bare legs, apparently unaware the camera was showing his bottom half.“In countries like Ireland where people are on smaller payments these farmers are even suffering further,” he continued, in reference to European Union CAP subsidies for farmers.The interpreters who were live translating his words into various European languages could be heard fighting back laughter as Mr Flanagan spoke.Following the contribution, committee chair MEP Norbert Lins grinned as he thanked Mr Flanagan for his words.The representative for Midlands-North-West laughed off the incident on social media, saying he had just returned from a run. “Was in a T-shirt two minutes before. Decided to put on shirt to look respectable! That worked really well,” Mr Flanagan wrote on Twitter. He told The  he was doing most of his meetings from the bedroom in his house in Roscommon as it is “the handiest place to work from” with his wife and children also at home.“I wasn’t that bothered to be quite honest,” Mr. Flanagan said of his appearance. “What’s in a pair of legs at the end of the day?”The European Parliament has set up a remote voting system to keep working throughout the pandemic, with MEPs able to cast ballots via email and participate in debates over video link.

If there were cheaper beds out there, we could have got them, but there weren’t.” Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill “Well, I wouldn’t start from here anyways.” That old joke about the farmer’s response to a tourist looking for directions came to mind when the Department of Health’s head honcho appeared at Tuesday’s meeting of the Covid Committee. Members wanted to hear all the details surrounding the “arrangement” between Jim Breslin’s department and the private hospitals which saw the temporary abandonment of our two-tier medical system as private beds were brought into the public hospital sector. But Breslin wasn’t laughing. With hindsight, he accepted there are aspects of the deal which his department might revisit when – nobody at the meeting was suggesting there might be an “if” – the second surge of the virus hits. But it’s easy after the event to take a more informed approach the next time and easier for politicians who weren’t confronted by the urgent necessity to secure critical hospital beds at short notice to ask searching questions about how this was achieved. There was a general view that the reason these private beds weren’t needed in the end was down to good luck, he said. They had been acquired “if Covid-19 took us to the place none of us wanted to go”. That journey didn’t happen, despite the woefully inadequate number of intensive care beds in the public system before anybody even knew of the existence of coronavirus. “But we are all a bit Irish, because we got through this and we look back and say ‘Oh, we must have been lucky’. We weren’t lucky with the amount of capacity we have. We knew on ICU that we had less than the international norms. We knew in other things that we were short, but yet we got through it and I think it’s worth asking the question: how come we have managed?” The secretary general pointed to the quality of staff here, the performance of people at the front line and the commitment from people in the health service. “I might even mention the department, I might mention the Oireachtas. We did manage to do something right.” He needed to get that off his chest. Bed shamblesBut we have entered strange territory when the man in charge of the Department of Health relies on the hospital beds shambles it presided over before the pandemic stuck to demonstrate just how well it responded to this particular crisis. All the witnesses appeared via video-link. But it was uneventful. All were wearing their full complement of clothes and there wasn’t as much as a bare ankle or hairy knee on show. The appearance of MEP Ming the Trouserless at a different committee meeting on Tuesday was far more entertaining. He made Roscommon the newest European fleshpot when contributing remotely to a meeting while unaware that the camera shot showed him sitting in his underwear. There’s an idea to liven things up in Leinster House, where video-links are now a thing. The two Sinn Féin TDs, David Cullinane and Louise O’Reilly, took the toughest line of the committee members present in the chamber. They were very concerned about the high cost of covering all the private beds in the country for the three-month emergency. Cullinane was like a terrier, snapping at the civil servant, hurrying him along, interrupting replies. The Waterford TD said less than half of the private beds were used. How much capacity did they think they needed? At the start, looking at what was happening in countries like Italy, “we considered we would probably need it all, and more besides”. So they negotiated a deal on the basis they would be using the full capacity in private hospitals?Used-car salesmanThe senior civil servant gave a classic senior civil servant’s answer: “We anticipated we potentially might.” Cullinane was not happy with the deal. “There were no other beds on the island that we could get access to . . . If there were cheaper beds out there, we could have got them, but there weren’t,” said Breslin. The Sinn Féin deputy then drew on his own expertise in the private sector. It seems he was once a used-car salesman. “I worked in the car sales industry at one point and I can tell you I would love to see people like you coming through the door if I was selling a used car.” Having heard the details, a cost of €300 million didn’t strike him as a good outcome, given there was no costbenefit analysis and less than half of the beds were used. Breslin bit back. “I’ll tell you what that sounds like to me: that sounds like a fire alarm went off and we sent four fire tenders to put out the fire and people are now saying we only should have sent three. I am very happy that we sent four fire tenders because what if it needed more than three?” Those four fire engines zig-zagged in and out of the exchanges for the rest of the session. “We were delighted that four fire engines were sent to deal with the crisis rather than three,” said Labour’s Duncan Smith. Róisín Shortall of the Social Democrat’s agreed with his comments. Fine Gael’s Colm Brophy thought some questions sounded like a case of “classic Monday morning quarterbacking”, a term used to describe people who criticise and offer alternative solutions after the event. As for the fire engines? “They were well-needed and well-wanted. I wouldn’t send any of them away early, that risk should never be taken.” Waterford Independent Matt Shanahan had a different take. He agreed it was right to dispatch four fire tenders “but I would also say that pretty soon we discovered that two fire tenders had the fire under control. We could have sent those other tenders off to treat fires elsewhere.” Sinn Féin’s Louise O’Reilly had the last word: “If we wanted a complete picture of that we could say that the conditions were created in advance for the fire to get out of control.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4269096.1591131880!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"programme for government must include fiscal responsibility varadkar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVaradkar raised the prospect of a cross-party effort to appoint senators to pass legislation if government formation talks had not concluded. File photograph: Crispin RodwellThe Fine Gael will not enter government “at all costs” and must see fiscal responsibility at the centre of any deal, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has told his TDs. A meeting of the Fine Gael parliamentary party, held remotely, also heard Mr Varadkar raise the prospect of cross-party efforts to appoint senators to pass legislation if government-formation talks had not concluded.Sections of emergency anti-terrorist and anti-crime gang legislation are set to lapse if a new government is not formed by the end of June because the Seanad is not in session.The provisions of the Offences against the State Act and the Criminal Justice Amendment Act 2009 are renewed each year by the end of June through a motion of both the Dáil and the Seanad.If the laws are not renewed by June 30th, then non-jury trials for certain offences will not be allowed. These include offences relating both to paramilitary and gang crimes, such as directing the activities of a criminal organisation or training in firearms.A number of provisions on evidence will also lapse including the extra powers given to gardaí to allow them to make inferences from an accused person’s silence.The measures will not be renewed because the Seanad is in abeyance until a new government is formed. Only 49 members of the 60-seat Seanad have been elected. The remaining 11 are chosen by the incoming taoiseach. Mr Varadkar is not empowered to nominate them.Senator Sean Kyne asked Mr Varadkar about this, and said it would be a shame if this was allowed lapse under Fine Gael. Mr Varadkar is understood to have responded that efforts would still be made to ensure that did not happen, such seeking “cross-party” approval to appoint 11 senators, even if such efforts are unsuccessful.Other parties immediately poured cold water on the idea, with one well-placed source arguing that a taoiseach has to be elected by the Dáil first. Both Mr Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney said that any programme for government must reflect Fine Gael values, citing fiscal responsibility and the deficit. Mr Varadkar is said to have told his TDs: “It won’t be government at all costs.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Officials and media say US criticism of Hong Kong policing illustrates double standardsExperts fear country\u0026rsquos caseload could reach 1m in several weeks if virus is not curbedBejing approved decision to create laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorismMove paves way for anti-sedition laws which rights advocates say will threaten city\u0026rsquos freedomsAt least 69 cases this week linked to cluster of infections at logistics facilityThousands take to streets to oppose Beijing-backed laws curtailing city\u0026rsquos freedomsMove to impose security law illustrates Beijing\u0026rsquos increasing tendency to flex its muscleProtesters get ready for more demonstrations against proposed Beijing lawsCommissioner in territory says contentious new security law aimed at \u0026lsquotroublemakers\u0026rsquoPM has made most of her communication skills and the country\u0026rsquos political cultureCian English (19), from Carlow, died following fall from Gold Coast apartmentChina proposes path to imposing rules used against dissidents on the mainlandPolice fire tear gas in popular shopping district as protesters take to the streets\u0026lsquoThere is a political virus spreading in United States,\u0026rsquo says China\u0026rsquos foreign ministerWinds gusting up to 210kmh expected near iron ore producing heartland of the PilbaraInvestigation begins into cause of Pakistan International Airlines crash that killed 97Officials confirm two survivors after PIA aircraft crashes in residential area of KarachiOutrage among pro-democracy legislators at security law put forward at National People\u0026rsquos CongressRescue teams hampered by torn-down power lines and flooding over large tracts of landPro-Beijing politicians are pushing contentious laws in the face of intense oppositionStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"War and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayAccident in which 15 wounded takes place during training exercise in Gulf of OmanFormation of coalition to proceed after supreme court clears way for PM to remain in officePolitics and ision facilitate virus in country with just 208 ventilators and scant testingPresident fears country\u0026rsquos 44 cases and three deaths could \u0026lsquosuddenly spike in few days or weeks\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

Some, even most, of the tough measures imposed in Norway\u0027s lockdown now looked like steps too far. Was it necessary to close schools? she mused. Perhaps not.It was a preemptive step only a leader with Solberg\u0027s folksy, down-to-earth style could get away with. I probably took many of the decisions out of fear, she admitted, reminding viewers of the terrifying images then flooding their screens from Italy.She is not the first in Norway to conclude that closing schools and kindergartens, making everyone work from home, or limiting gatherings to a maximum of five people might have been excessive.As far back as May 5, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) published a briefing note reporting that at the time the lockdown was imposed on March 12, Norway\u0027s reproduction number - the number of people each infected person on average infects - had already fallen to 1.1. It slipped under 1 on March 19.  Our assessment now....is that we could possibly have achieved the same effects and avoided some of the unfortunate impacts by not locking down, but by instead keeping open but with infection control measures, Camilla Stoltenberg, NIPH\u0027s Director General (and the sister of Nato head Jens Stoltenberg) said in a TV interview earlier this month.No one doubts Norway\u0027s success in bringing the pandemic under control. On Friday, there were just 30 people in hospital with coronavirus and five on a ventilator. Only one person had died all week. The per capita death toll is now 44 per million people, just over a tenth of that seen in neighbouring Sweden, where 4,971 people have died.But this success has come at a prohibitive social and economic cost. An expert committee charged with carrying out a cost-benefit analysis into the lockdown measures in April estimated that they had together cost Norway 27bn kroner (£2.3) every month. With only 0.7 per cent of Norwegians infected, according to NIPH estimates, there is almost no immunity in the population.The expert committee concluded last Friday that the country should avoid lockdown if there is a second wave of infections.We recommend a much lighter approach, the committee\u0027s head, Steinar Holden, an Oslo University economics professor, told the Sunday .  We should start with measures at an inidual level -- which is what we have now -- and if there’s a second wave, we should have measures in the local area where this occurs, and avoid measures at a national level if that is possible.Norway\u0027s current strategy -- using testing, contact tracing, and home isolation to keep the level of infections down without heavy restrictions -- would be best, the report concluded. But if this \u0027keep down\u0027 strategy fails to prevent a surge in cases, a \u0027brake strategy\u0027 which aims to suppress the rate of transmission but not bring it below 1, would be preferable to a lockdown.If it’s necessary to have very strict restrictions for a long time, then the costs are higher than letting the infection go through the population, Holden told the . Because that would be immensely costly.According to the report, a brake strategy would cost as much as 234bn kroner (£20bn) less than an unstable keep-down scenario, if you assume that those infected gain immunity and that no vaccine is developed until 2023. But it would also lead to a little over 3,000 additional deaths.  One measure that no one thinks should be reimposed is school closures.Holden\u0027s committee estimated in April that the measure had cost 6.7 bn kroner (£520m) a month, while at best having little impact on the spread of infection. NIPH has gone further, and suggested that school closures may have even increased the spread.Margrethe Greve-Isdahl, the doctor who is NIPH\u0027s expert on infections in schools, told the  that if schools hadn\u0027t been closed, they could have played a role in informing people in immigrant communities - which were hit disproportionately hard by the epidemic - of hygiene and social distancing rules.They can learn these measures in school and teach their parents and grandparents, so at least for some of these hard-to-reach minorities, there might be a positive effect from keeping kids in school.There were also fears in late March and April that adolescents were spreading the virus more out of schools than they would have been in them. There were large groups of adolescents that were hanging out together and not necessarily following any preventive measures, Greve-Isdahl said.  But perhaps the main reason Norway is unlikely to close schools again, whatever happens in future waves of infection, is the recognition of the impact on the most vulnerable pupils.  There\u0027s now a lot of information available on how it has impacted negatively on the economy and on vulnerable children. Their whole care system has kind of collapsed, Greve-Isdahl says. I think there would be it would be difficult to impose heavy restrictions again.Norway, it seems, has already decided a second lockdown is not the way to go, however much the infection flares up again. But that does not mean its prime minister has any regrets.I think it was the right to do at the time, she said. Based on the information we had, we took a precautionary strategy.It will probably never be possible to know, she added, which of the lockdown measures Norway imposed caused the number of infections to drop away so sharply, if any.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pandora pledges use recycled metals jewellery 2025","story":"The jewellery company Pandora has announced it will stop using mined silver and gold by 2025 and only buy from recycled sources as it seeks to lower its carbon footprint.The Danish company, known for its charm bracelets, claims the move will cut emissions by two thirds for silver and by more than 99 per cent for gold.Alexander Lacik, Pandora\u0027s CEO said: Silver and gold are beautiful jewellery materials that can be recycled forever without losing their quality.Metals mined centuries ago are just as good as new. They will never tarnish or decay. We wish to help develop a more responsible way of crafting affordable luxury, like our jewellery, and prevent these fine metals ending up in landfills. We want to do our part to build a more circular economy.The company intends to source the precious metals from recycled laptops and phones to cut down on mining, which can have devastating effects on bioersity as well as contributing to soil erosion and contaminating groundwater with chemicals.The company, which operates in more than 100 countries, already uses recycled materials in 71 per cent of its supply chain, but will now extend them to all of its parts including chains and fixings.Only about 15 per cent of the world\u0027s silver currently comes from recycled sources. Doubling that would cut carbon emissions by the equivalent of powering 42,000 homes, Pandora claims.Currently, only 35 per cent of silver used in consumer electronics is recycled in Europe, dropping to 15 per cent in Asia.Rising demand for electrical goods has led to an increase in deep sea mining, which threatens marine ecosystems and risks polluting the oceans.The European Union plans to extend its incoming right to repair rules on appliances to cover electronic devices, forcing manufacturers to make their products easier to reuse.Mads Twomey-Madsen, Pandora\u0027s head of sustainability, said he is calling on the electronics industries to play into this challenge and make it easier for consumers to recycle their unwanted gadgets.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"two metre social distancing rulebased outdated science may have","story":"The two-metre rule on social distancing is based on outdated science that may have overestimated the risk by up to fifteen times, senior MPs and scientists have warned.The Government on Tuesday said the controversial rule would stay in place despite a major study showing the comparative risk of halving the distance to one metre was far less than previously thought.Business leaders and MPs have called for the guidance to be altered in line with WHO guidance and rules followed by some other countries in order to avoid mass redundancies and help the hospitality sector reopen.Last week, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, suggested two metres was still necessary as the risk of spreading the virus remained too great.But an analysis published on Tuesday in the Lancet found the risk of standing one metre apart was only around twice that of standing two metres apart - a 2.6 per cent chance of catching the disease compared to 1.3 per cent.Keeping one metre apart also cuts the overall risk of catching coronavirus by 80 per cent, the study found.Professor Robert Dingwall, a Government adviser on Covid-19, said scientists backing the two-metre rule were relying too heavily on experimental lab work that doesn\u0027t translate into a real world setting.Prof Dingwall, an advocate of reducing social distancing to one metre, said that too many scientists were basing their calculations for safe distancing on transmission of the disease in the laboratory, failing to take into account real world conditions in which air flow played a huge part in dispersing the virus. He believes there is almost zero risk of catching Covid-19 outdoors and that one metre is sufficient for maintaining a safe social distance.In the latest paper produced by the the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) committee on the issue in April, scientists recommended keeping the rule, saying two metres is a good measure of the distance where the direct person-to-person transmission risk drops significantly. The paper, based on previous studies from countries including China, US and South Africa, said: Evidence from modelling studies and simple calculation in a room without ventilation flow suggests that exposure could be 10-30 times higher at one metre compared to two metres.On May 27, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had asked members of Sage to review the guidance.However, a Number 10 spokesman said on Tuesday that the Government still believes the two-metre rule should remain in place. Greg Clark, chairman of the science and technology committee, said ministers should only be using the most “up-to-date” scientific analysis to decide whether to reduce the distance.  “Now the world has several months’ experience of the coronavirus we have the chance to learn how countries with different rules – such as Germany, Australia and Singapore – have fared in practice,” he told the . “As we come out of lockdown it may be the case that the distance rules can be set to reflect different situations – recognising that the risk of transmission is much less outdoors than indoors, for example, and that wearing face masks protects people against infection.”On Tuesday, the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH) stressed the vital importance of the two-metre distance as more businesses prepare to open.The professional body, which represents those who work in environmental health roles such as in the food, housing and transport industries, urged the Government to maintain the two-metre guidance especially for riskier businesses including pubs.CIEH Wales director Kate Thompson said: Protecting public health and avoiding the possibility of a second peak of infections should be key. It is, therefore, vital that the two-metre rule is not reduced due to pressure from industry.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bame covid coronavirus black ethnic minority background","story":"Despite only accounting for 13 per cent of the population in England and Wales, 44 per cent of all NHS doctors and 24 per cent of nurses are from a BAME background.Of at least 169 front-line health and social care workers in England and Wales known to have died because of Covid-19, 63.9 per cent were black or from an ethnic minority.Among them was Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, a 53-year-old consultant who warned the Prime Minister about the need for more personal protective equipment (PPE) to support NHS staff during the pandemic.In a Facebook post in March, he warned Boris Johnson to “ensure urgently personal protective equipment for each and every NHS worker”.Manjeet Singh Riyat, who was the United Kingdom\u0027s first Sikh A\u0026ampE consultant, died on April 20. Mr Riyat was described as instrumental in building emergency services in Derbyshire over the last two decades, and was widely respected across the NHS.Bhai Amrik Singh, the Chair of the Sikh Federation (UK) said: “Manjeet had spent most of his life helping others as an A\u0026ampE consultant, from treating the sick to training junior doctors. Something very much in line with his faith principles of being a devout Sikh.”“This is a true tragedy, as another frontline NHS worker falls victim to this deadly virus. His death comes as a huge loss to the Derby \u0026amp Burton hospital, wider NHS family and to the whole Sikh community.”“The limited data available and images of those who have passed away suggests Covid-19 is disproportionally impacting on Sikhs and wider BAME communities.”Dr Chaand Nagpaul, British Medical Association (BMA) council chair, welcomed the review into BAME deaths, but stressed it must be informed by real-time data to understand why the virus appears to be disproportionately affecting BAME communities and healthcare workers. “This must include daily updates on ethnicity, circumstance and all protected characteristics of all patients in hospital as well as levels of illness in the community which is not currently recorded,” Dr Nagpaul said.“The government must send a directive to every hospital telling them to record the ethnicity of patients who are admitted and succumb to COVID immediately.”Black, Asian and minority ethnic patients are shown by new data to face a disproportionately high risk of death from coronavirus. Black men and women are more than four times more likely to die a coronavirus-related death than white people, new analysis by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has suggested.Black males in England and Wales are 4.2 times more likely, while black women are 4.3 times more likely to die after contracting the virus, after accounting for age. eople of Bangladeshi and Pakistani, Indian, and mixed ethnicities also had an increased risk of death involving Covid-19.A study released on May 1 by the Institute of Fiscal Studies has shown that people of black African origin are three times more likely to die of coronavirus in the UK than white Britons, with deaths among those of Pakistani heritage 2.7 times as high.Of the 13,918 victims who tested positive in hospital up to April 17, 16.2 per cent of these were of BAME background. BAME communities make up around 13 per cent of the total population.Initial data on patients with confirmed Covid-19 from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) also suggested ethnic minorities are over-represented compared with the general population.Around 7.5 per cent of the population were Asian and 3.3 per cent black in the 2011 UK census.The first 10 doctors named as having died from Covid-19 in the UK were from BAME communities - a figure that the Labour Party described as deeply disturbing.Some analysts have suggested that the burden of coronavirus falls on poorer communities, in which BAME people are over-represented.Marsha de Cordova, the shadow equalities secretary, called for the Government to urgently investigate why BAME communities are more vulnerable to this virus.Her call came after the chairman of the BMA, Dr Nagpaul, said it could not be random that the first 10 doctors named as having died from the virus were all from BAME communities.Those doctors have ancestry in regions including Asia, the Middle East and Africa. However, the BMA chair said that even allowing for the over-representation of BAME staff in the NHS the fact that they were all from ethnic minorities was “extremely disturbing and worrying”.England\u0027s Chief Medical Officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said it was critical to find out which groups are most at risk. He said it remains unclear why some ethnic groups appear to be more vulnerable. I\u0027ve had discussions with scientists about this in terms of trying to tease this apart today, he said.It is not just in the UK that the number of BAME people affected by coronavirus has caused alarm.In the United States there has been growing concern over the rising number of coronavirus deaths among African-American communities. The latest data suggests that people who are black or hiic in the US are twice as likely to die from Covid-19.In states reporting fatalities by race, 34 per cent of American victims were black, according to research from John Hopkins University, and black Americans also represent 33 per cent of coronavirus hospital admissions.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"new lockdown rules uk government guidelines","story":"When Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown on March 23, few people realised it would mean they would be prevented from family get-togethers for a full 10 weeks.Grandparents who have had to rely on photographs or Skype calls to see their grandchildren growing up are now finally able to see them in the flesh again after the Prime Minister said he could allow a “limited and cautious” easing of social restrictions from June 1.They will, however, have to resist the temptation to hug or kiss them or hold babies in their arms because people living in different households must stay two metres apart.Mr Johnson acknowledged the “frustration” many people will still feel, but at long last families and friends can spend time together in back gardens and even look forward to a summer barbecue.Yes you can, as long as they are not in the “shielding” category. From Monday, you can meet five other people at any one time, as long as it is in an outdoor space and social distancing is maintained. That means any two people from different households must stay two metres apart, though any groupings who live in the same house don’t need to socially distance from each other.Over-70s can be among them, as long as they take “extra care” with social distancing, hand-washing and touching hard surfaces where the virus might linger.You can now meet friends and family in your garden, in a park or any other outdoor space. Currently people have been able to meet in parks but not gardens. The Prime Minister said last night:“This was a cautious first step - but we know that there is no difference in the health risk. So we will now allow people to meet in gardens and other private outdoor spaces.”Yes you can, as long as you stay outside. There is no rule that dictates whose garden you can or can’t meet in. However, if young children from different households are part of the group, they must not share paddling pools, climbing frames, slides or anything else that would encourage them to be closer than two metres to each other and touch hard surfaces.However maintaining the two-metre social distancing rule for people who live in different households is still “essential”.Up to six people from six different households. The Government decided not to press ahead with an earlier plan for two households to be allowed to meet (to the exclusion of other households) and also decided against the “bubble” model of a set number of nominated friends and family who could meet each other.It means you can meet five friends on one day, and five other friends on another day, but Government sources have asked people to use “common sense” and not to invite, for example, three groups of five to your house at different times on the same day.That’s fine, as long as you take care not to touch surfaces or “linger” indoors. Just go straight through the house into the garden and use your common sense. If you do have a side gate or a garage through which you can access the garden, use that instead.Yes you can, as long as you stick to the six person rule and maintain social distancing. You can serve food and drinks but make sure crockery and cutlery are thoroughly cleaned before and afterwards, don’t share plates, cutlery, serving spoons or glasses and encourage people to fetch their own plates and utensils from a pile rather than handing them round.Mr Johnson said barbecues are allowed provided everybody washes their hands and “exercises common sense”. The Prime Ministerwarned: “If you\u0027re going to do things like that it\u0027s got to be incredibly scrupulous, and, and, and careful. Otherwise really we risk just transmitting that disease again.”Prof Whitty said people should take care eating with their hands at a barbecue. He said: “Remember that passing things from one person to another, if you haven\u0027t washed your hands, you could transmit the virus that wayYes you can, as long as you pay special attention to washing your hands thoroughly and avoid touching things on the way through the house. You could also use a paper towel to open and close bathroom doors and consider other sensible measures such as kitchen roll to dry hands on rather than a shared towel.Prof. Whitty said if someone went to use the lavatory it would be “absolutely critical that they wipe everything down, wash their hands, all the way through.”You can use a patio or roof terrace, if you have one, but otherwise you will need to meet your friends and family in a park or open space. Indoor meetings are strictly prohibited.Use an umbrella, or go home. Do not invite everyone indoors to keep dry, as this would be in breach of the rules.No. Overnight stays are banned. Even camping in your friend’s garden is banned because the Government has not relaxed the rules on overnight stays in any way.Asked if people can visit family and camp in their garden overnight, Mr Johnson said:“We don\u0027t want people to stay overnight. We don\u0027t want people to go to other households and stay there. I\u0027m just afraid we\u0027re not at that stage.”He added: “We’re not saying that people should now be allowed to move freely across the country and stay in other people’s houses. That is not where we are yet.”Yes it does. Until now, you have only been able to play outdoor sports with one other person, but the new rules mean that groups of up to six can meet at a time, as long as they observe social distancing rules.It means that four-ball golf groupings and doubles matches in tennis are back on (though your doubles partner must live with you), as well as kickabouts in the park.Outdoor exercise classes with up to six people are also allowed, as long as they stay 2m apart from each other, but any sporting activity that involves contact is still banned for non-elite sports, meaning you can kick a ball to each other but you can’t tackle.People who are classed as “extremely clinically vulnerable” will not see restrictions lifted and must continue to shield themselves.Mr Johnson said: “We are looking carefully at how we can make your life easier, and how we can better support you, and we want to say more on that soon.”He added: “ I do understand how difficult this has been for you, especially.And I want to thank you for all the efforts you have gone to - because your actions have helped the NHS to cope.”Not if you do not live in the same household. Asked when people will be able to hug close family again, Mr Johnson re-emphasised the need to maintain social distancing rules and said: “We\u0027re not there yet.”He said: “It\u0027s very, very important that people understand the really limited nature of what we\u0027re saying. We do want people to be able to see their friends and family. “We do want people to be able to see two grandparents at once, but it\u0027s got to be socially distant.” On June 1 the \u0027s Front Bench Editor, Daniel Capurro, answered your questions on the new lockdown rules. Read on for the best questions and answers.Email your questions for our next Q\u0026ampA to yourstory@telegraph. If you would like to remain anonymous please disclose this when you ask your question. George Eliot in the comments section asked: I am buying another home, expecting to complete soon.  I’m currently living in family accommodation, and I will still have most of my stuff in this  place for a while, until we get round to selling it.  Does that mean I cannot stay overnight in my new property?  The rules about not staying overnight in second homes seem at odds with the flexibility being given to other aspects of lockdown.If you are moving into your new home permanently then it does not count as your second home and you are free to stay there. You should not, however, be iding your time between the two properties. The point is for you not to keep travelling between communities and risking spreading the virus between the two. Marie Rayner via email asked about the new rule allowing six people to gather in a private garden, which was been a popular question among our readers.With regards to the new regulations where you can meet up to six friends, what happens if you are a family of more four or more? Does it mean a family of four can see two other people? A family of five can see one other person? A family of six or more cannot see anyone else?Groups of more than six people are only allowed if you are all from the same household. If there is a mix of households involved then no more than six people can meet, this includes hosting people in private gardens and roof terraces. You do not, of course, have to take your entire family everywhere you go, so, for example, two people from a family of six could meet four people from a family of five in the park. Mervyn AP in the comments section asked:Are we allowed to give our son driving lessons again?If you are in the same household, you are allowed to drive together to spend time outdoors or visit a shop that is open. There is nothing in the regulations that prevents a learner driver from being at the wheel. If your son is not in your household, then no, you may not. It is not possible to maintain social distancing during a driving lesson. You can read more in our guide here.A reader who\u0027d like to remain anonymous asked:In the case of orced parents what if one parent has very strong views their child should return to school on June 1 but the other is too concerned about the risks?The regulations do not take a view on this. It would be for the parents of the child to discuss and come to an arrangement that was within the rights set out by their custody agreement.My wife and I operate a holiday park in Northumberland. We have 70 acres of land , which has the Pennine Way going through and we adjoin the Kielder Forest.Can we allow our customers to visit their caravans just to check them?Non-essential businesses are not permitted to reopen until June 15 and indoor visits remain illegal except in very specific circumstances.Is there a limit on how far we can travel to see family?No, but you must not stay overnight and you may only see them outdoors and while maintaining social distancing. Our next question comes from a reader who\u0027d like to remain anonymous. They ask:My ex husband has our children 50 per cent of the time. When they are with me he wants to travel to London to stay with his girlfriend and her son. I don’t see from the guidance that this is allowed but how can I stop him? What if he agrees but goes anyway we would never know?If your ex husband is staying overnight somewhere that is not his primary residence then he is breaking the law and the police may choose to issue a fine if he is caught doing so. Are people with heart disease allowed out?If you should be shielding, you should by now have been contacted by your GP or the NHS with advice on how to do so. From June 1, those who are shielding have been advised that they may leave the house to be outdoors once a day and following strict social distancing guidelines. If in doubt, you should speak to your GP.Both my husband and I usually care for our grandchildren whilst the parents go to work. Sometimes it would be all five together (two households) ages 16 months to 12 years old. As schools nurseries and childminders can now have children are we allowed to start having the grandchildren again?Two of them are in year 6 and will be at school together.The new rules only apply to being outdoors and require that you stay two metres apart from members of other households, they are not intended to apply to childcare of family members. It is still illegal to have visitors indoors, except for specific exceptions. We have seven people in our household, does that mean we can invite another five around from different households for a BBQ making it 12 total? Or is it six total people if from different households?It is six in total, so you would not be able to have anyone round while all seven of you were in the garden.Why is it OK for day trippers to swarm to the country’s beauty spots, which rarely look socially distanced, leaving litter, doing their business behind bushes or in the sea and increasing the risk for local residents but not second home owners who have somewhere to go and can still observe a largely stay at home message and therefore limit these risks? Second home owners are also paying full council tax in these areas but can not go?I appreciate it’s a first world problem and the political implications but I’m really struggling to see a real reason.It is not, in fact, OK for day trippers to break social distancing rules by entering overcrowded beaches and beauty spots. They should not be breaking social distancing rules, although clearly this is hard to police. Second homes remain, however, a separate issue, because overnight stays are not permitted. The Government does not want people regularly flitting between communities and potentially spreading the virus. Council tax is neither here nor there.With the greater autonomy in the countries that comprise the UK, is a family in England allowed to visit their family in Wales?Or do we have to wait until the Welsh Secretary makes an announcement on this?Welsh rules apply in Wales and you must wait until the Welsh government makes an announcement. Currently, residents of Wales are not meant to travel more than five miles to see friends or family. My daughters household consists of a total of six two adults three teenagers and a two-year-old, can I still meet up with them as this would make us a group of seven (myself included)?You cannot meet up with them all at once, but there is nothing to prevent you meeting five or fewer of them either in a private garden or open space or a public area.Office work seems to have dropped off the radar from the government in this next phase. Are office workers allowed to return to a Covid-secure workplace?Even those that are technically able to work from home?The Government has said that all those who can work from home should continue to do so, but anyone who cannot work from home should return to work. That being said, businesses are still responsible for the health and safety of their employees and must have appropriate measures in place. Our 30-year-old son lives in 150 miles from us and is struggling to pay his rent. He wants to vacate his room in a shared house and come to live with us. Are we able to go and get him is my first question, and would we then need to go into self-isolation?  Here is what Dan has to say: The regulations are not clear on that question for adults in general, but on the issue of students in accommodation it says they are permitted to “change their primary residence for the purpose of the emergency period”. There is also no specific requirement to self-isolate after such a journey, but, applying common sense, it would be a good idea for anyone who had moved primary residence to avoid contact with others for some time.My wife and I have long made occasional journeys, by car, about 10 miles each way, to tend to a family grave. We have not done so during this crisis  –  can we now or next week resume these excursions?You can resume them right away. There is no limit on how far you may drive for your time spent outdoors, or the number of times you can go outside. You should, of course, continue to follow social distancing rules while there.I am 74 and diabetic and my husband is 88 and diabetic but not on medication. Otherwise we are very healthy and active.I have a son of 46 who is asthmatic and a bit overweight but in a different household. Do we come in the vulnerable or critically vulnerable category? What actually are the vulnerable category guidelines now as we don’t like to take any risks.Anyone who is considered vulnerable for medical reasons should by now have been contacted by the NHS or by their general practitioner and told to shield themselves. However, anyone over 70, no matter how healthy or otherwise, is still advised to take extra care in minimising their contact with anyone from outside of their household.My mother is 98, lives alone and is on medication for high blood pressure. She is in good  health other than her chronic arthritis. She did not get a letter from her doctor\u0027s surgery telling her she needs to shield herself. I have made minimum  care visits to dress a score on her leg as directed by her doctor and take her her weekly shopping and attend her care needs as required. I have been the only one who is supporting her in this lockdown. Other than my carer visits, she has been in self-isolation.With the new guidelines starting on June 1, are we able to visit her as part of socialising in her garden remaining two metres apart?Am I able to bring her by car to our house for a BBQ outside while maintaining the social distancing?From June 1, those who are shielding have been advised that they can leave home once a day to spend time outdoors and that they can do so with members of their own household or a single member of another household, at a distance of two metres. Therefore you should only visit her alone. The Government also advises against anyone sharing private vehicles with members of other households, although there are guidelines in place for if you must do so.What about those of us who have larger families within our household? We are a family of six. There are four children under eight. So we are still not able to see friends or family even at a distance?My children are desperately missing their friends. We\u0027ve stuck to the rules for ten long weeks and because of the size of our household we are still no nearer to being allowed contact with others?Unfortunately, as an entire household you cannot have guests. However, there is no reason under the new regulations why part of your household, say you and two of your children, could not visit another household or meet up with your children’s friends in the park.Peter Layton in the comments section asked: My wife is in a care home with dementia and I ring her daily for a short period.Am I allowed to take her out for a period after I meet her at the front door? She is fully mobile. Could I also take her in our car for a drive? There have been no cases of the virus at the home and I have self-isolated since lockdown.The Government guidance, as of June 1, is that vulnerable people are advised that they can go outside once a day and be accompanied by a single member of another household at a safe distance. You should not take her for a drive, however, as social distancing is not possible in a car.D Whyte in the comments section asked:We are in our 60s and 70s : can anyone tell us if it is legal for the Government to keep us locked up? Can we make our own choice in this or not?We are fit and healthy enough – more so than a lot of overweight and unhealthy people younger than us.A number of things remain illegal, including overnight stays away from your primary residence and visiting friends and family in an indoor setting. This is by Act of Parliament and if you break these laws, you are liable to be fined. Beyond that, there is nothing to force you to follow the rules, but those over 70 are advised to shield themselves because age itself is a risk factor for the virus, not just underlying health conditions. Even if you yourself are not bothered by the risks, you may end up taking a hospital bed and a ventilator from someone else who needs them. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/28/17/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-with-retina-display-screen-05042020.jpg","title":"apple bug app log in update fix iphone mac","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.The bug affected \u0027Sign in with Apple\u0027, a way for iOS users to log into apps that avoided competing, popular services from Facebook and Google\u0026nbspApple has fixed a sign-in bug that could have allowed malicious iniduals to take control of a user’s account, paying $100,000 to the person who found it.The flaw relates to the “Sign in with Apple” feature, which the company introduced in 2019 as a privacy-focused alternative to the sign-in options from Facebook or Google, yet one that is easier than using an email login.At the end of May, however, developer Bhavuk Jain disclosed a software vulnerability which meant that hackers could have achieved a “full account takeover of user accounts on that third party application irrespective of a victim having a valid Apple ID or not.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe issue was caused by code generated from Apple’s servers that was used to log in based on a user’s Apple ID email, but it was found that code could be generated for any email identification and Apple would verify the login.“Sign in with Apple” works by using a JWT (JSON Web Token) or a code from the Apple server. The request is made to the server, a JWT is sent to the user, which then logs into the third party application via Apple’s servers again. All of this is done almost instantly.However, Jain found that the JWT request was not secure. “I could request JWTs for any Email ID from Apple and when the signature of these tokens was verified using Apple’s public key, they showed as valid. This means an attacker could forge a JWT by linking any Email ID to it and gaining access to the victim’s account,” Jain wrote.After disclosing the bug, Jain received $100,000 as part of Apple’s bug bounty program. Apple says that it had checked its server logs and found no evidence that the exploit was used to take control of any accounts.This is not the only patch Apple had to make to its iOS 13.5 update.

In place of a funny script and a decipherable plot, the sequel shoves in endless celebrity cameos. Skrillex, Susan Boyle and Justin Bieber are one of the 39 celebrities that appear in the film, but the force of star power fails to make Zoolander 2 enjoyable.227 I Still Know What You Did Last SummerAn island getaway becomes the setting of predictable kills and lazy thrills in this sub-par slasher. Jennifer Love Hewitt, haunted by the events of the first film, leads a cast running for their lives. The implausibly gullible teen characters still scream, the red herrings are still obvious, and we still know how it’s all going to end.Jaws 2 sees the great white original reduced to a lukewarm b-movie filled with bad special effects and clumsy editing. The only positive thing about Jaws 2 is that all the characters are so annoying that it’s actually pretty satisfying watching them get eaten alive. See also Jaws 3, 4 and 5.He might have been a crazed narcissist, but Patrick Bateman deserved better than this sequel. Thankfully, no one actually remembers that American Psycho 2 exists, or that Mila Kunis is the lead, which is good because it ruins the ambiguous ending of the original film. No amount of peppermint sheet masks could ever clean this mess of a movie up. Deciding to leave Baby in the corner, Havana Nights shares little with the original Dirty Dancing. Patrick Swayze’s simmering dance instructor becomes a charisma deprived pool boy. Our heroine has been replaced by an uptight WASP and worst of all there’s no overhead lift. Your eyes will be left hungry for more.Even if you don’t like James Cameron’s 1997 Oscar-winning behemoth, it’s hard to forget the iconic image of a ship and its passengers meeting their watery doom. The digital effects of Titanic II, however, look like a child’s version of the original’s visuals. The plot – about a boat literally named Titanic II that takes its maiden voyage 100 years after the first – is equally creaky.Ten years after the original film, Mac Davis and Jackie Gleason fill in for Paul Newman and Robert Redford in this heist remake. Considering the movie’s clumsy mobster dialogue and slow-moving plot, the audience in 1983 might have felt like they were the ones who had really been hoodwinked.827 Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2The original Blair Witch changed the face of horror forever, inspiring hysteria with its cheap but innovative found-footage hook. Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 has better production values, but manages to be far less clever. A group of students visiting the first film’s location find themselves in danger, and the plot unravels from there.John Rambo is stripped of any the nuance he had in the first film, becoming an all-American macho cliche and increasing his body count through cartoonish violence. The ex-soldier tears through Vietnam to rescue American prisoners of war as a one man army, seemingly impervious to bullets or logic. If the absurd plot doesn’t jar for you, the politics probably will.Given the global recession that hung over this follow-up to the original 1987 Wall Street, director Oliver Stone could have made a far more interesting and timely film. A cast including Michael Sheen and Shia LaBeouf provide diminishing returns in a tale of greed that ultimately pulls its punches.1127 Weekend at Bernie\u0027s 2You may ask yourself how it’s possible to make a sequel to a film based on two friends pretending a corpse is still alive in order to party. The makers of Weekend at Bernie’s 2 were probably asking themselves the same thing in 1993. This tired comedy never crosses over from stupid into funny, despite many of the cast returning to try and recapture the dubious magic.The sequel to Donnie Darko toys with the concept of time, by wasting yours. The dialogue is awful, the acting wooden, and you don’t even get to see an angsty black haired Jake Gyllenhaal in all his blue-eyed glory. Director of the original, Richard Kelly, was so offended by S. Darko he described the experience of watching it as “horribly violating”.Robert De Niro’s reputation continued to devalue with the third installment of the Meet The Parents series. The title indicates how much effort was put into this family comedy, which relies on under-the-belt hits to wring any laughs out of its audience.This follow-up to the flashy 2013 film squanders the only reason it would have a sequel, and somehow is not named Now You See Me Now. The sleight-of-hand magic here is all style and no substance, and the endless overcomplicated reveals of characters tricking each other become very irritating.Mulan is a gender-bending, brave heroine who refuses to conform to society\u0027s expectations of her. That is, until she reappears in the Disney sequel as a devoted wife who is more than willing to comply with her husbands demands. Now even her pet dragon Mushu doesn’t like her. 1627 Son of the MaskJim Carrey is replaced by Alan Cumming in this low-budget comedy sequel, which manages to be both frantic and boring at once. Director Lawrence Guterman tries to make up for the lack of Carrey’s signature comedic vim by adding a baby and a dog, but their antics can’t distract from the ugly production design.Danny and Sandy flying off into the sunset should have been the end of Grease. But money-hungry film execs brought us back to Rydell High for sequel fans were hopelessly undevoted to. I hated that film with a vengeance and could not believe how bad it was, said Sandy stand-in Michelle Pfieffer years later. At the time I was young and didn\u0027t know any better.1827 Dumb and Dumber ToStupider even than its title, the Farrelly brothers’ sequel puts its stars (Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels) through an overlong retread of past material. The broad humour feels decades out of date, and the energy that propelled the original through its juvenile jokes is gone. It’s hard to imagine who was the target audience for these gross-out sight gags.Hitchcock’s 1963 film The Birds was a masterclass in suspense. The birds that menace Tippi Hedron and the other inhabitants of Bodega Bay become genuinely disturbing through a slow, atmospheric build of tension. This made-for-TV sequel has the same avian threat, and some of the same cast, but none of the classic thrills.Sharon Stone had bad instincts when she agreed to this film. Even a new take on her iconic leg-crossing interrogation scene couldn’t save this sequel from one of the worst rotten tomato ratings on record. It managed to make less than $6m Stateside on a $70m budget.Amy Adams tries her best to tear into her role as a sadistic, sex-obsessed bully but the script for Cruel Intentions 2 – strictly speaking, a prequel, but sssh – is so bad that even she failed to save it. When her stepbrother Sebastian moves into her Mum’s Manhattan mansion, she barges into his shower and warns him, no one is going to threaten my cushy life. What teenager would ever say cushy life? Did a Mean Girls sequel happen if Tina Fey wasn’t around to write it? No, no it did not. A Plastics vs nerds turf war in the pits of the high school jungle just doesn’t work without Fey’s tight one-liners. In Mean Girls 2 we hear none of the “on Wednesdays we wear pink” “that\u0027s why her hair is so big. It\u0027s full of secrets” “you can’t sit with us” zingers that made the original film so magical. Although the soundtrack had its fans, this film is essentially a remake of the 1980 original without one half of the titular Blues Brothers (John Belushi died in 1982). Bafflingly, he is replaced by a 10-year old child in sunglasses. It’s half as funny and nowhere near as infectiously fun, but if you only care about the music, that might not matter.Infamous for ruining what would have been, in many critics’ eyes, a perfect trio of movies, The Godfather Part III delivers a slow anti-climax. The film has its defenders, but given the calibre of the first two Godfathers, this last instalment is the black sheep of the family.A young Hilary Swank stars in the fourth Karate Kid film, a precursor to the modern trend of rebooting ailing franchises with a female lead. Pat Morita as Mr Miyagi is charming as always, but the script is mostly recycled. There are a couple of interesting differences: Swank has a pet hawk, Buddhist monks dance to the Cranberries, and there’s almost no fighting. But what’s a Karate Kid sequel without the Kid or the karate?It might be called Staying Alive, but you won’t want to after watching this sequel. Six years after our hero Tony Manero made white polyester bell bottoms popular, we check back in on him as he auditions for a new Broadway musical called Satan’s Alley. There are far too many romantic subplots, oiled up chests and loincloths to make this film okay. Keanu Reeves wisely didn’t pick up the phone for this Razzie-winning action thriller. The speeding bus rigged by a bomber in the 1994 film is bizarrely replaced by a cruise ship here, making the action a lot slower and more boring. Poor Sandra Bullock is given nothing interesting to do, and surely must have been tempted to look for a lifeboat.

Outstanding balances on loans fell by a further £2.4bn, taking total consumer credit lending to £64bn, the Bank of England said.The fall in net borrowing was primarily driven by consumers taking out less new credit than in previous months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBorrowers benefited from a sharp reduction in overdraft interest rates to just under 11 per cent, some 15 percentage points lower than the previous average.Under pressure from regulators to help struggling customers, banks have introduced £500 interest-free overdraft buffers.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?The figures raise questions for the Treasury as it attempts to get Britain’s economy back on its feet.While ministers may welcome a reduction in high-cost borrowing, the figures also point to a sharp drop-off in consumer spending which will severely hurt many businesses.“Households have reduced the amount they are borrowing in consumer credit as spending has fallen with Covid-19,” the Bank said.With benefit claims rising at their fastest rate ever and the threat of millions more becoming jobless as the government’s job retention scheme tapers off over coming months, there is a risk that demand for goods and services will crash further, an outcome that could put companies out of business, thereby deepening and prolonging the recession.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, forecast that spending and borrowing would rebound this month, as shops re-open their doors.He added: “But we doubt that households will spend the cash they have accumulated during the lockdown soon, given heightened job insecurity and lingering concerns about catching the virus.”The Bank of England’s data also showed that mortgage approvals fell to their lowest level since comparable records began in 1993.“Mortgage approvals likely will snap back too, now that in-person property viewings are allowed,” said Mr Tombs. “But with mortgage rates having fallen only marginally so far this year, unemployment set to rise and banks intending to restrict the supply of secured credit, we expect mortgage lending to remain at least 10 per cent below its pre-virus peak in the second half of this year.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Just under seven per cent of those polled intended to bring manufacturing into the UK.Eight in 10 employers said more meetings would take place over video conferencing rather than face-to-face, and staff who do have to meet others will do so in smaller numbers.Staggered start times, professional cleaning services and the introduction of PPE were also being considered by many bosses – and some intended to give their staff the freedom to plan where they want to work, and when.This could also lead to a rise in job opportunities for those not living in cities like London, if employers are more open to recruiting staff for remote working.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Outstanding balances on loans fell by a further £2.4bn, taking total consumer credit lending to £64bn, the Bank of England said.The fall in net borrowing was primarily driven by consumers taking out less new credit than in previous months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBorrowers benefited from a sharp reduction in overdraft interest rates to just under 11 per cent, some 15 percentage points lower than the previous average.Under pressure from regulators to help struggling customers, banks have introduced £500 interest-free overdraft buffers.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?The figures raise questions for the Treasury as it attempts to get Britain’s economy back on its feet.While ministers may welcome a reduction in high-cost borrowing, the figures also point to a sharp drop-off in consumer spending which will severely hurt many businesses.“Households have reduced the amount they are borrowing in consumer credit as spending has fallen with Covid-19,” the Bank said.With benefit claims rising at their fastest rate ever and the threat of millions more becoming jobless as the government’s job retention scheme tapers off over coming months, there is a risk that demand for goods and services will crash further, an outcome that could put companies out of business, thereby deepening and prolonging the recession.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, forecast that spending and borrowing would rebound this month, as shops re-open their doors.He added: “But we doubt that households will spend the cash they have accumulated during the lockdown soon, given heightened job insecurity and lingering concerns about catching the virus.”The Bank of England’s data also showed that mortgage approvals fell to their lowest level since comparable records began in 1993.“Mortgage approvals likely will snap back too, now that in-person property viewings are allowed,” said Mr Tombs. “But with mortgage rates having fallen only marginally so far this year, unemployment set to rise and banks intending to restrict the supply of secured credit, we expect mortgage lending to remain at least 10 per cent below its pre-virus peak in the second half of this year.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Meanwhile, others were teaching their classmates how to wash their hands.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“They are overjoyed to be back,” says Adams – who runs Oaklea Montessori, a group of three nurseries in Essex. “They were rushing in.”Nurseries have been shut for more than two months to limit the spread of coronavirus, although some – like two of Adams’ settings – have stayed open for children of key workers.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?From Monday this week, the government gave the green light for nurseries to reopen to all children, as well as for primary schools to bring back certain classes. According to Adams, having stayed partially open throughout the pandemic has helped ease parents’ anxieties about sending their children back.“We haven’t had any cases and nobody has been ill,” she says. “I think it helps to reassure parents it is going to be ok.”Hannah Tranah, the childcare development manager at the nursery group Storal Learning, said many children were happy to be back after spending ten weeks at home.“A lot have been running through the doors excited to get back in,” she tells The Independent.“So many have been excited to be back at nursery with their friends in an environment they know well, and with staff they know well.”However, things have not gone exactly back to normal just yet. Nurseries have had to adapt for children and staff safety during the pandemic, especially due to the difficulty of getting young children to keep their distance from one another.“To a certain degree, it’s near impossible to get young children to social distance,” adds Tranah. “We are doing a lot to educate the older children about what social distancing is and why we’re doing it.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailStaff at Storal Learning, which has more than 20 nurseries in England, have been using stories to explain distancing.Adams says her Essex nurseries are not enforcing social distancing between the children.  “Particularly with under-twos, I think that would be absolutely impossible,” she added.They have capped their numbers to around half of what they would usually have, with between 10 to 12 children coming in at each setting. “We’re trying to combine groups of children so siblings are together and they remain with the practitioner throughout the day, ideally throughout the week,” Adams says. “That is a different way of working because normally there is an awful lot of flow.”They have also stepped up cleaning – for example, wiping down inidual books - and carrying out lots of risk assessments, the Essex nursery owner and practitioner says. Children can still play with soft toys – which are regularly cleaned – although there are less on offer than before.  “It is really important to keep comfort and to keep it a homely place,” Adams says. “That is very important. We didn’t want it to become completely sterile.”Storal Learning nurseries have also found ways to adapt to protect children and employees during the Covid-19 outbreak. Staff are assigned to a bubble, or a group of children who has limited contact with other bubbles, Varun Chanrai, the managing director, said. “Some smaller nurseries may have had to put a cap on occupancy but we haven’t had to do that because of the size of the buildings,” he tells The Independent.Teachers can stay away when schools reopen if they have ‘safety fears’Even at half term, families queue for food in school playgroundNot safe to reopen all schools next week, Independent Sage warnsHands and toys are washed regularly, and parents asked to drop children off at staggered times, Tranah explains. As nurseries make the first step to getting back to normal, challenges still remain for those operating with reduced numbers.   Experts have even warned some childcare providers could go out of business as they struggle to cope during the coronavirus crisis. Nearly three in four nursery leaders expect to operate at a loss over the next three months amid reduced demand and increased costs associated with operating safely, a survey by the National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) has suggested. “It’s a real threat to the sector,” warns Chanrai​, although he is not worried about his company due to its large size.“There are challenges at the best of times, and when you’re operating at such low capacity, the challenges are exacerbated for sure.”“We need to have a reasonable consistency throughout the summer,” says Adams.“I wouldn’t be at all surprised if there are a number of settings that will close as a consequence.”Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But the Department for Health and Social Care has repeatedly failed to provide a daily testing figure in May, an omission which No 10 has been unable to explain.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile the number of people tested remains unclear, the highest known daily total was 80,297 on 21 May. The health secretary revealed on Monday that capacity is now at 206,000, however this includes at least 40,000 antibody tests, which were counted towards the target after hospitals were instructed to start using them on Friday.The largest number of tests given on a single day was 164,757 on 19 May, with the most recent total at the time of writing on 31 May being less than 130,000.The government has acknowledged that large-scale testing and contact tracing will be vital to ending the lockdown, having promised in the earlier stages of the pandemic to eventually deliver 250,000 tests a day.After the government declared it had met its initial goal of providing 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April – a claim contested amid accusations of data manipulation – a new target for May was set.​This pledge was then watered down, with Downing Street stressing that the 200,000 target set by the PM related only to testing capacity and not to the number of tests actually carried out.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However some, including Lil Nas X, have expressed concern that it could have an adverse effect.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I know y’all mean well but... bro saying stop posting for a day is the worst idea ever,” Lil Nas X tweeted.He added: “I just really think this is the time to push as hard as ever. I don’t think the movement has ever been this powerful. We don’t need to slow it down by posting nothing. We need to spread info and be as loud as ever.”Instagram users urged to be careful over ‘Blackout Tuesday’Why people are posting black squares to their InstagramBlack Lives Matter protesters stage marches around the worldSeth Rogen tells off people criticising Black Lives Matter supportMusician Dillon Francis pointed out in response that some people have been posting black squares using the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag, which has the negative effect to drown out important information for the movement.Lil Nas X shared Francis’s message, adding: “This is not helping us. Bro who the hell thought of this?? Ppl need to see what’s going on.”He then suggested other ways people could support the movement, writing: “Not tryna be announcing but what if we posted donation and petitions links on Instagram all at the same time instead of pitch-black images.”People have urged social media users to use caution if they decide to participate in Blackout Tuesday.Notably, participants have been asked not to use the #BLM and #BlackLivesMatter hashtags if they post black squares, and some have suggested people continue sharing information.UPDATE (02.06.20) A previous version of this article’s headline incorrectly stated that Lil Nas X had stated that he deemed the Blackout Tuesday initiative to be “the worst idea ever”. This headline took his words out of context. As made clear in the article, Lil Nas X was criticising the decision of some social media users to post images of black squares on Instagram, rather than deciding to support the movement in other ways.

This month also sees the arrival of new Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams comedy Eurovision Song Contest.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAs ever, there is a whole bunch of licenced content being included, ranging from films such as Hereditary, Mamma Mia!

I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 430 27. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 630 25. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Magic realism comes to Netflix in this coming-of-age story set in Dakar, Senegal. Ada (Mame Bineta Sane) is betrothed to a wealthy man but then falls in love with construction worker Souleiman (Ibrahima Traoré). When he vanishes her world is tipped head-over-heels. In truth, the bare-bone plot is merely the chassis upon which director Mati Diop drapes a hallucinatory romance and mystery with elements of the supernatural.Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Price twinkle ecumenically in this two-hander about Pontiffs Benedict XVI (Hopkins) and Francis (Price) who are thrown together at a time of crisis for the Church. The two leads were nominated for Oscars, as was screenwriter Anthony McCarten, adapting his 2019 play of the same name.Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1630 15. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1730 14. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.2030 11. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2330 8. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? Adam Sandler blazes like a diamond-drill in Josh and Benny Safdie’s sensory-rush drama about a jeweller and gambling addict trying to hold onto his sanity as his world comes crashing down. It’s an exhausting, sometimes overwhelming watch – but with Sandler as the audience’s lodestar, it’s a journey worth staying with.Noah Baumbach draws on the breakdown of his marriage to Jennifer Jason Leigh in this unflinching chronicling of a modern orce. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are compelling as a couple who wake one morning to discover they’ve fallen out of love, while Laura Dern deservedly won an Oscar as Johansson’s force-of-nature attorney.2730 4. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2830 3. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. Teaming up with De Niro, Pacino and Joe Pesci, Martin Scorsese suggested The Irishman might be the cinematic event of the decade. There is certainly lots to love in this generations-ning tale of hitman Frank Sheeran (De Niro) and his relationship with union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) and his own daughter (Anna Paquin). True, the film isn’t quite a classic at the level of Goodfellas. The de-aging technology employed to turn the cast into thirtysomething gangsters feels rubbery and unconvincing. And the 209-minute running time left many viewers suffering numb bum. But it’s still Scorsese doing mobsters and unmistakably the work of a director reaching for a big artistic statement.The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  130 30. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter.

Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are compelling as a couple who wake one morning to discover they’ve fallen out of love, while Laura Dern deservedly won an Oscar as Johansson’s force-of-nature attorney.2730 4. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2830 3. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. Teaming up with De Niro, Pacino and Joe Pesci, Martin Scorsese suggested The Irishman might be the cinematic event of the decade. There is certainly lots to love in this generations-ning tale of hitman Frank Sheeran (De Niro) and his relationship with union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) and his own daughter (Anna Paquin). True, the film isn’t quite a classic at the level of Goodfellas. The de-aging technology employed to turn the cast into thirtysomething gangsters feels rubbery and unconvincing. And the 209-minute running time left many viewers suffering numb bum. But it’s still Scorsese doing mobsters and unmistakably the work of a director reaching for a big artistic statement.The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.

This is our reality. You deciding to ignore it for your own comfort doesn’t make it any less true.”Rogen had little patience for the “all lives matter” rhetoric on his Instagram page. To one person complaining that others were “making this only about” black people, Rogen responded: “F*** off. You don’t deserve my movies anymore. Stop watching my s**.”Several other people left variations of “all lives matter” on Rogen’s post, to which he replied with messages such as ”shut the f*** up”, “f*** off”, and “f*** you and both your parents”.Rogen has been praised for his reaction on Twitter, where people have been sharing screenshots of his Instagram responses and applauding his approach.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Felix Project has supplied 1,376 tons of produce since 23 March, the equivalent of 3,276,190 meals. This support has ameliorated the deep distress of those unable to afford or access food – in particular, families struggling below the breadline, NHS workers and the elderly.The sum raised from sales of Hirst’s rainbow butterfly hearts means that we are more than halfway to our goal of securing £10m for The Felix Project to help food-poor Londoners over the next three years. It is a pledge given added urgency by the latest jobless claims, which have surged to more than two million.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMore than 4,400 people backed our campaign by purchasing the Hirst limited edition prints – 3,109 bought the small size, costing £300 each, and 1,299 bought the large size, costing £1,000. The net proceeds amounted to £1.55m. Mr Hirst said: “It’s amazing to see how people have pulled together and helped each other during this crisis. I am so grateful to everyone who has helped me do my little bit and bought a butterfly heart edition – it’s turned out to be a brilliant communal way to help raise money for The Felix Project and support their important work across London.”How to support our campaignEvgeny Lebedev, shareholder in The Independent, said: “I have long believed in the power of art and this is a wonderful affirmation of that. With the support of Damien Hirst we have passed the halfway point in our mission to ensure no Londoner in any corner of the city goes hungry because of Covid.”Other substantial new donors to our campaign include management consultants McKinsey \u0026amp Company, whose employees voted to make our appeal partner their charity of choice.Olga Nefedova, associate partner, said: “We are making a donation to organisations helping our most vulnerable communities. The Felix Project is very much one of these organisations.”So far, more than six million meals have been delivered by the London Food Alliance – established in response to the coronavirus pandemic and made up of Felix, FareShare and City Harvest – of which over half have been supplied by The Felix Project.Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, paid tribute to the extraordinary all-round effort. “London was hit hard and fast – but oh, how it has stepped up and fought back,” he said. “We are inspired by the mobilisation of businesses, donors and supporters who have joined forces with our staff and volunteers.” The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Colman visits The Felix ProjectRebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

I feel so angry, isolated, desperate to talk to someone. I have been contacting people I lost touch with a long time ago, just to have someone to talk to.”Ms Olley, who is 73 and has no television and only last week bought a computer, said staying in her London home of 40 years was having an impact on her physically.“I am beginning to feel old,” she said. “I sit on the sofa and don’t move much, so you feel like an old lady. You see people out and about and you’re stuck inside. You want to go out but I have been feeling fearful about coronavirus because of my age. You see people outside and think, ‘How come they get to go out? Why can’t I?’”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFor many people over 70 who have been told to self-isolate, the pandemic has been a mental and physical challenge. For some, it has also meant extra anxiety of being unable to access food easily.Ms Olley has come to rely for her daily meals on a doughty little charity called Made in Hackney, a cookery school delivering food supplied by our appeal partner, The Felix Project. The charity supplies 500 nutritious meals a day to the borough’s most vulnerable and nearly half its beneficiaries are over 70. Although the service was due to stop on 17 June, it is fundraising so the team can continue.How to support our campaignShe added: “Knowing that someone would come to my house and see if I was dead or alive every day – it sounds bad, but it is reassuring. The volunteers have been wonderful. They ring you occasionally to check in as well.”Another Made in Hackney beneficiary is Nigel Howat, 79, a former sightseeing bus company boss who has lived in his Hackney housing association accommodation for more than 20 years.Due to his age, he sometimes struggles to breathe. He also has a gluten intolerance, with wheat products making him violently ill. While he has neighbours to chat to from a safe distance, he has been missing his family. His stepson, Darren, was recently diagnosed with lymphoid cancer.“He lives in Merton and I haven’t seen him since his diagnosis,” said Mr Howat. “Normally I would be there to support him, but that is impossible at the moment, so it’s been hard.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The charity suggests up to 2.4 million people aged 70 and over have difficulty with at least one element of daily living.Angus Wyllie, 72, from Barnet, has struggled with cooking and operating his iPad to keep in touch with his relatives.“I am more of a ‘put a ready meal in the oven’ kind of person,” he admitted. “My iPad packed up early into lockdown which meant I couldn’t contact people, or get deliveries.”He has benefited from the largesse of Katie-Louise Barber who has been cooking hundreds of meals from Felix-supplied produce out of her home in Barnet since the start of the pandemic. She delivers her food parcels across London every week and about half are to the elderly.Top chefs ‘rhyme for restaurants’ in support of our appealIt’s a laugh cooking with kids, says actor David MorrisseyHelp the Hungry tops £5.5m following successful Hirst heart sale“Katie has been a lifesaver,” Mr Wyllie said. “She has been delivering to a few neighbours including a family of three nearby who have been struggling.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

The NI Assembly has passed a motion calling for a transition extension until we get through the Covid crisis. For the past 3 years the UK government said it wanted to listen to NI’s representatives. We’ve spoken – over to them.”During the debate, the former No 10 adviser also urged members to “consider whether their constituents deserve the consequences of a crash out of the transition at the end of this year in the middle of the biggest global health crisis that any of us have lived through”.He said: “Some will say, ‘What is the point of this motion? Boris Johnston and his gang will do whatever they want. Stormont is irrelevant’. Except that last part is not true. At the insistence of Boris Johnston\u0027s government, the Northern Ireland Assembly is a named party to the withdrawal agreement. That is unique. The Scottish Parliament is not mentioned the Welsh Assembly is not mentioned Dáil Éireann is not mentioned the Bundestag is not mentioned but we are.” Sadiq Khan breaks Labour ranks to call for Brexit transition extensionResponding to vote, the Liberal Democrat’s Brexit and foreign affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael said: “The Conservatives’ proposed Brexit will have a profound impact on the people and businesses of Northern Ireland.” He added: “The NI Assembly’s vote is a clear indication that Boris Johnson must rethink and do the right thing for those across the UK. Not enough progress has been made on negotiations and we are now dangerously close to the extension deadline.”Ahead of the motion being debated at Stormont, however, the DUP’s Westminster MP Sammy Wilson, described the motion as “irrelevant”, adding: “This is a decision to be made in London. The prime minister has made it quite clear that the 31 December is still the deadline”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They must now offer the same level of support to those who need to self-isolate.”She added: “The short term cost will be nothing compared to the long-term impact of failing to control another outbreak.”Rachel Harrison, national officer at the GMB union, said the scheme had been brought in by ministers on whopping salaries without any real understanding of its impact on working people.“People are being forced back to work in unsafe working environments, on unsafe public transport, to come into contact with people with Covid-19, and then be forced to take 14 days off work on statutory sick pay, she said.“Civic duty does not pay the bills, neither does statutory sick pay. If the government is instructing people to stay at home, they must pay their wages. Otherwise track and trace will just spread either poverty or infection.”Union leaders have previously expressed concern that the test and trace system will be undermined unless sick pay is increased.TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said the government must raise statutory sick pay to the level of the real Living Wage – which works out at around £325 per week – and ensure the lowest paid workers are eligible.She said: “Everyone wants NHS Test and Trace to work, so we can all get on with our lives. But it’s not viable to ask people to self-isolate, perhaps repeatedly, if they will be pushed into financial hardship by doing so.”It comes amid problems with the rollout of the test and trace scheme, with NHS contact tracers unable to log on when it first launched last week. The accompanying smartphone which was originally due to launch in mid May has not yet been made widely available.On Monday Mr Hancock insisted the test and trace system was a success but he was unable to provide figures of many people had been contacted so far.However, figures obtained by Channel 4 News suggested fewer than four in 10 coronavirus patients identified by the scheme so far had been contacted.The Treasury has been contacted by comment.test and trace\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Jacob Rees-Mogg has vowed to bring forward a motion that will allow MPs who can’t attend parliament physically on “medical grounds” to continue to ask questions remotely – but defended ending virtual voting.The partial climbdown from the government comes after ministers faced significant criticism from cross-party MPs over the decision to end the so-called “hybrid parliament” which was introduced due to the outbreak of coronavirus.Those opposed to the proposals said MPs self-isolating or shielding due to Covid-19 and cannot be physically present in the Commons would be unable to participate in parliamentary business and represent constituents.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDuring the first socially distanced vote on Tuesday, MPs were seen in long queues stretching across the parliamentary estate, with some posting on social media of the “ludicrous scenes” before walking through the chamber inidually to vote.They voted by 261 to 163 in favour of the government’s motion which stated members “may only participate physically within the parliamentary estate” – ending the virtual proceedings that came into force in April.Created with Sketch.How coronavirus lockdowns changed the world\u0027s most polluted cities Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Earlier, the leader of the Commons Mr Rees-Mogg unveiled the government’s compromise, saying he will bring forward a motion on Wednesday “to allow members who for medical grounds are unable to attend to continue to appear for scrutiny – that is to say questions, urgent questions and statements – remotely”.But defending the decision to end virtual voting, he said: “Voting while enjoying a sunny walk or watching television does democracy an injustice – the solemn decisions we take together affect the lives of millions of people in this country.”“We ask members to vote in person for a reason, because it is the heart of what parliament is about,” he added.His comments provoked an immediate backlash, with senior Labour MP Hilary Benn commenting: “It’s completely unacceptable for the government to continue to deny MPs who are shielding, or living with those who are, the right to vote in the parliament to which they have been elected.”Shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz said Mr Rees-Mogg had acted in a “staggeringly arrogant” manner, adding: “What the leader of the House is proposing is discriminatory.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Many are shielding, some can’t get childcare, others can’t travel. Yet, Rees-Mogg demands MPs return to vote in person. “Rees-Mogg is preventing MPs with caring commitments, or need to shield, from having their say. It’s democracy for the elite.”While welcoming the physical return of parliament, the former Tory chancellor Sajid Javid earlier said: “I cannot understand why MPs genuinely affected by Covid-19 – such as those shielding, self-isolating, caring – are unable to vote by proxy. I hope the government thinks again.”“I’ll be joining 1km+ queue of MPs to vote to keep remote participation so everyone can represent their constituents.”The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) also wrote to all MPs on Tuesday warning that proposals to end remote voting will “place at significant disadvantage MPs who are shielding or self-isolating”. Tories join revolt to stop older and sick MPs losing ‘right to vote’EHRC’s chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath said: “We are concerned by the announcement today from the leader of the House of Commons which implies parliament may proceed without provision for the remote participation of members who are unable to travel to Westminster because of the pandemic.“This will place at significant disadvantage MPs who are shielding or self-isolating because of age, disability, health conditions or pregnancy, as well as other members who will struggle to attend the chamber in person due to travel restrictions and caring responsibilities.“It cannot be right for parliament to proceed without provision for remote participation when many elected representatives cannot attend in person.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Just under seven per cent of those polled intended to bring manufacturing into the UK.Eight in 10 employers said more meetings would take place over video conferencing rather than face-to-face, and staff who do have to meet others will do so in smaller numbers.Staggered start times, professional cleaning services and the introduction of PPE were also being considered by many bosses – and some intended to give their staff the freedom to plan where they want to work, and when.This could also lead to a rise in job opportunities for those not living in cities like London, if employers are more open to recruiting staff for remote working.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His freedom came about based on his acquittal from charges.”The release comes as the Trump administration continues a maximum-pressure campaign targeting Iran after unilaterally withdrawing from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers in May 2018.Since then, both countries have seen a series of escalating incidents, including a US drone strike that killed Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad earlier this year and an Iranian ballistic missile attack targeting American troops in Iraq.Additional reporting by APDepartment of Homeland Security\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Children who have lost a term’s schooling are effectively immune and don’t spread the virus.We know thousands are missing le-saving early diagnosis and treatment for non-Covid diseases.We know depression, drugs and domestic abuse are costing lives.Yet there are virtually no new cases of Covid outside hospitals and care homes.Scientists think the virus was already petering out as the world pulled down the shutters.They can find no evidence that ending lockdown leads to a deadly second wave.How did we end up in this state of paralysed confusion The question must be put as soon as possible to a public inquiry led by a figure of impeccable authority.It will inevitably focus on “the Blob” — the well-meaning but short-sighted officials who think they run the country.If the inquiry does its job, it will shake up the vast NHS bureaucracy, bungling Public Health England and the poorly named Sage committee of scientic experts.It will find outthe so-called Care Quality Commission let down care homes and why the Cabinet Office Civil Contingencies Secretariat was caught with its pants down.It will swtly provide the basis for a shake-up of the entire civil service, whose mandarin class desperately needs reform as Britain takes on the world after Brexit.Their foam-flecked four-letter fury is matched only by their hypocrisy.Alastair Campbell is a sad relic of his former self. Newsnight’s Emily Maitlis has removed all doubt about her rancid Tory hatred.They are as much to blame for the spiteful mob outside Cummings’ home as beneath-contempt Emily Thornberry.But they all come last behind self-described “farting fatty” Miriam Margolyes, who wished Boris Johnson dead as he fought for breath in intensive care.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All of which are already severely scarred by  weeks of lockdown.But it also grossly undermines the idea of a global, outward looking post-Brexit Britain.Brexiteers rightly laughed at Remoaners who shrieked that our thriving banking and financial services industries would move abroadwe left the EU.Butwe close ourselves off to international business because of the virus, their hysterical predictions could actually come true.Of course the last thing we want is the country flooded with infected tourists.But health checks at airports would be a much better way to keep Brits safe.TOP scientist Professor Peter Openshaw has the right idea: the Government should lt lockdown restrictions by region. Yes, the Prime Minister might feel uncomfortable singling out a specic town or city for draconian restrictions.But the economy must come before political niceties. And shutting down businesses in Cornwall because of a minor new outbreak in Newcastle would be economically bonkers.France — with a population comparable to the UK — introduced “red” and “green” zones when restrictions were first eased on May . Two weeks on, deaths across the country are still falling.It’s time Britain followed suit. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The entire show was given over to Dominic Cummings.None of it was funny, obviously. Have I Got News For You hasn’t been funny in years.What still slightly surprised me, however, was that they chose to believe every single negative story the Press had written about him, last week, including some of the stuff which, like the police hauling him in for questioning, was clearly a load of cobblers.Quite a contrast to the previous week when, based on one Mail on Sunday story, host Charlie Brooker asked: “Why do you think the Press has got it in for Keir Starmer ”Apart from the fact the entire Press hasn’t got it in for him , it’s the question’s assumption that gives the game away here.The BBC and HIGNFY have already decided Keir Starmer is great and will not tolerate any dissent.I’m grateful for it anyway, as it shines a light on the dumb equation that’s come to govern this show: Have I Got News For You believes every bad word written about the Government and disbelieves every bad word written of the Opposition.If a satirical show is stupid enough to put every politician it agrees withoff limits, it’s guaranteed to fail, which is why HIGNFY’s time has come and long gone and it deserves to be jettisoned as quickly as possible.For that to happen, though, the BBC would need to dismount its high horse, admit errors and bias and change its political culture entirely.So expect it to keep coming back.

They have croissants.”The real grit in the oyster, however, was actress Britt Ekland who, apart from those moments when she was chasing after multi-millionaire Duncan, always gave the impression she’d rather set fire to her own Wicker Man than spend one more second in India.Would she finally be converted to the idea, the last episode of the series asked, by spending a night at a luxury retirement complex, in the foothills of the Himalayas, with Henry Blofeld and Paul Chuckle Well, Britt arrived like a dry cough in the morning, but  hours later . . .“This is my ultimate hell.

Yet now the rate is going down we are going to start doing so.This will seem perverse to the millions of us who have complied with ­lockdown laws while seeing planes arrive from highly infected nations.While we are effectively ­closing our borders, other nations are loosening their restrictions and opening up their markets to foreign travel.Many British companies have offices and subsidiaries overseas but the bosses of those firms won’t be able to visit their foreign-based business centres because they will face a two-week quarantine upon their .It gives totally the wrong impression to the world.The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, had rightly ­campaigned for Brexit on the basis that Britain would be an outward-looking nation.

Around  per cent of the ­British workforce — four ­million people — have jobs either in or linked to tourism in this country.The industry is worth £billion to the economy but since lockdown it has stalled.The winter months are quiet, the spring has been spent in lockdown and the summer months are the most crucial.When the Government’s­ ­furlough scheme comes to an end, businesses will face some very tough ­choices.I am concerned about my ,-strong workforce and the last thing I would want to do is lay off staff. But I have got £.million going out the window every month due to lockdown.There are many businesses in this country that will not be able to weather the storm.Tourist destinations across the country, such as the Cotswolds and Bronte country in West Yorkshire, rely heavily on foreign visitors.At my London hotels, more than  per cent of the ­business comes from overseas.To make matters worse, while most European countries — including Italy — have reduced the two-metre social distancing rule to one metre, just about making operating possible, we continue to persist with the two-metre ruling.How can you go to a restaurant where everyone will be two metres apart  How will staff serve you at a distance Of course, every Covid- death we have seen is a ­tragedy and my heart goes out to the families of the victims.But the reality of the disease is that for the majority of the population, the virus is not deadly unless there are underlying health issues.I am  and had three bad weeks with the virus — a week of high temperature, a week of gradually losing the symptoms and a third week where I was like a wet rag.At my age, it takes four or five weeks to properly recover from it.We must not lose sight of the number of livelihoods that have already been seriously damaged and the millions of people who will find themselves out of jobs at the end of lockdown.For the tourism industry, which has already been brought to a standstill, the two-week quarantine would be the final nail in the coffin.Let’s keep Britain open, so there is hope for the future.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Conventional wisdom about sound money and financial prudence has disappeared.Until recently the enemies of socialism, the Conservatives have now become converts to government action.Mrs Thatcher famously talked about “rolling back the frontiers of the state.”Now, in the wake of the Covid crisis, they have come sweeping forward once more.In the process, the public finances have taken a battering.In April the Government borrowed over £billion, a larger sum than for the whole of .The fiscal deficit is now projected to reach no less than £billion, perhaps even £billion in the worst case scenario.At the same time, more than million people — more than half the entire national workforce — are effectively on the state payroll.Even as lockdown eases, much of the economy has now been taken into the custody of the state.All this has to be paid for — and the bills cannot be met simply by printing more money.That is the route to a debased currency, soaring interest rates and hyperinflation.The reality is that massive state intervention is simply not sustainable except in an emergency.If printing money were the recipe for prosperity, then Zimbabwe would be the richest country on earth rather than mired in poverty.That is the lesson of history.If the Government carries on spending and intervening on a level that would have even made Jeremy Corbyn blush, then our country will be in real danger of sliding back to the dark days of the s.Gripped by industrial unrest and economic decline, Britain then was known as the “sick man of Europe”.Because of extravagant spending, the public finances were in a desperate state. In  inflation reached  per cent.The following year, Britain’s deficit was so enormous that the Government humiliatingly had to ask for a £.billion handout from the IMF.With the economy limping from one crisis to another, taxes soared, with the top rate on “unearned income” reaching  per cent.Some of the revenue was swallowed up in bailouts of troubled companies.In  the engine and car maker Rolls-Royce was rescued, followed by the Upper Clyde shipbuilders in  and volume motor manufacturer British Leyland in .Indeed, this was an era of institutionalised bullying by the strike-happy trade unions, who held the Government and the nation to ransom by flexing their industrial muscle.When Sir Horace Cutler, the Tory leader of the Greater London Council in the late s, was asked how many people work for London Transport, he replied, “about half of them.”In , which saw the Winter of Discontent, no fewer than million working days were lost to stoppages.At the peak of the disruption, bodies were left unburied and rubbish piled high in the street.The very fabric of society appeared to be falling part.“There is madness in the air,” recorded Bernard Donoghue, an aide to the Prime Minister Jim Callaghan.It was precisely the public’s revulsion at failed socialism and trade union irresponsibility that brought Margaret Thatcher to power in  on a  of reviving the economy.She achieved it by taming the unions, reinvigorating enterprise, restoring the work ethic and shrinking the Government.We need the same again today. All the good work of the last four decades will be undonewe slide back into the dependency culture, headed by a sprawling, sclerotic state machine.The only sure foundation on which to build a lasting recovery is by the wealth creation of the private sector.In practice that means the Government’s priority must be to encourage commerce and competition, not to dish out subsidies.So businesses should be urged to re-open as soon as possible, backed up by reductions in corporation tax and rates.Barriers to growth, like the strict social distancing limits, should be lted.At the same time, the Government should drop its plans to impose heavy-handed rules on quarantine for all travellers to Britain.It is a policy that will do nothing to protect public health but will cause huge damage to the economy, especially the travel industry.Similarly, Britain’s highly flexible labour market — the engine of the job creation miracle since  — must be maintained in the face of demands for more regulations.The best support that the Government can provide is not bailouts and bureaucracy, but a dynamic business environment along with a strong civic infrastructure, including modernised transport links and improved broadband.Soon after he became Prime Minister in , Jim Callaghan said: “We used to think we could spend our way out of recession. I tell you in all candour, that option no longer exists.”Under siege from inflation and the unions, his government was unable to abide by those sensible words.But as we come out of lockdown, their truth is more important than ever.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The NHS also removed ibuprofen as a suggested treatment for mild cases. But, a subsequent study suggested the drug did not worsen or improve patients conditions.Now, a team of scientists in London are starting a new clinical trial to seethe anti-inflammatory could in fact help speed up the recovery in some patients by reducing serious side effects.Its hoped the drug could lead to shorter hospital stays and fewer people ending up in intensive care units .Animal studies have shown that the treatment can increase survival rates by  per cent.Prof Mitul Mehta, whos leading the trial at KCL, told PA: This is very promising, but of course it is an animal study, so we want to translate that really compelling result into humans.Its a trial for patients with Covid- disease to seegiving them an anti-inflammatory drug - a specic form of ibuprofen - will reduce the respiratory problems they have.Prof Mehta stressed that the trial was for patients already in hospital, not those with mild or suspected Covid-.Volunteers will be selected from patients who are in hospital, but that are not so ill they need intensive care.Prof Mehta said: If we can reduce their symptoms at that stage we have a number of benefits. We could reduce the amount of time someone spends in hospital - they might recover quicker and go home, thats obviously a fantastic outcome.We also might be reduce the degree of respiratory distress so that it can be managed in the hospital setting, without needing to go to ICU, and thats a fantastic outcome as well.Theoretically, this treatment, given at this time, should be beneficial.But, of course, this is based on animal studies. Its based on case reports, we need to do a trial to show that the evidence actually matches what we expect to happen.The Liberate trial is being carried out at KCL as well as Guys and St Thomass NHS Foundation Trust, along with the pharmaceutical organisation, the SEEK Group.Half of the patients taking part will be given standard care, while the other half will receive standard care as well as the special ibuprofen formulation.Prof Matthew Hotopf, director of the NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre, said: This highly innovative therapeutic approach seeks to rapidly advance a potentially important new treatment.If successful, the global public health value of this trial would be immense given the low cost and availability of this medicine.Earlier this year, at the start of the pandemic, there was some controversy over the use of ibuprofen after a French health minister advised against using it.Scientists in the UK launched a review and the NHS removed the drug as a recommended treatment for mild cases. But the findings showed ibuprofen does not make Covid infections better or worse.The Commission on Human Medicines expert working group concluded: There is currently insufficient evidence to establish a link between use of ibuprofen and susceptibility to contracting Covid- or the worsening of symptoms. To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

or at least a conversation about his concerns.All fell on deaf ears, and then Kate comes along, snaps her fingers and gets an outpouring of support.Meghan says its just so telling.She explained this was one of the main reasons why she and Harry said their goodbyes to royal le - the lack of support and complete disregard for the pain and anguish Meghan suffered while being crucied in the media.Meghan said, rather than backing her, she was made to feel like she was asking too much, expecting too much, when all she wanted was support from the powers that be.It comes after claims that Kate and William are taking legal action against Tatler. The article made reference to eating disorders, suggesting Kate has become “perilously thin like Princess Diana”.Kate and William have reportedly demanded the magazine remove its online profile of Kate.And a royal source said the article caused immense unnecessary pain for Kate.Last year, it was claimed that the so-called Fab Four split when Harry accused Prince William and Kate of not supporting Meghan ahead of their wedding."},{"url":null,"title":"new zealand scrap social distancing monday boosting hopes rest world","story":"NEW Zealand is set to scrap social distancing from next week after  days without a single new case of coronavirus.The country has just one active case of COVID- in the country today and has recorded only  deaths and , cases since the pandemic began.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern had previously said June  was the latest a decision to loosen remaining social distancing restrictions would come, and on June  the Government would reconsider the settings of alert level .But after speaking with director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield this week, Ardern said the country could be in level  as early as June , as long as we keep seeing the results were seeing now.She said: We are exceeding our expectations in terms of our progress, which is a fantastic position to be in.Our strategy of go hard, go early has paid off.Gong to level  means all social distancing measures and limits on mass gatherings will be lted, but borders will remain closed to the outside world   The South Pacic island nation of . million people had introduced a strict lockdown and enforced it for nearly seven weeks, despite there being no signs an epidemic was taking hold.Most businesses were shut and everyone except essential workers had to stay at home.Ms Ardern added: We will be one of the first countries in the world toto this level of normality so quickly.Meanwhile in the UK daily coronavirus cases are falling to some of the lowest rates since the outbreak with the latest daily cases standing at , and the overnight death toll of , with nearly , dead so far. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the coronavirus outbreak has had a very signicant impact on Britain.He told tonights No  briefing that it underlined the importance of developing a test and trace system.It is undoubtedly true that we have had a very signicant impact from this virus -

And Britain has been very good at it.But as we slowly move out of lockdown with thoughts of shopping, seeing our friends and family, and a cool drink in a pub garden, how effective this two-metre rule actually is has become a new national obsession.Many are starting to ask: Do we really need to keep a two-metre gap  Could it in fact be ONE metre  It may sound trivial, a metre is still too far to hug, kiss, even to shake hands with friends and loved ones.But for many businesses which rely on allowing people to gather more closely — theatres, restaurants, pubs, to name but a few — cutting the official social distance in half could be the dference between keeping afloat or going under.The official advice of the World Health Organization is that one metre is sufficient, a belief shared by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The Danes changed their position three weeks ago to one metre and most of the European countries’ public health officials advise one metre in certain circumstances.Now a new study by the WHO has found that while a two-metre distance reduced the risk of the virus being passed on to . per cent, a one-metre gap only increased the chance of transmission to . per cent.So a small risk either way, but enough to justy potentially endangering some of the industries we both enjoy and, for many thousands, rely upon for work. I have been asking for a couple of months how that distance was established, yet its origins are very obscure.It seems to go back to research on the distance between beds in the old-fashioned Nightingale wards in the s. It has become a folklore of infection control and public health, until people have started asking questions about it today.Experiments about the distance droplets travel have been conducted under such articial conditions that they are not applicable to everyday lives.Laboratory air is articially still, whereas air is not still, even when you are sitting in a room with all the windows and doors closed. Air flow breaks up the particles from a sneeze or a cough and they tend to fall pretty quickly on to your clothes or face.The serious risk of infection is when you get up to half a metre away from somebody with Covid- who sneezes or coughs.But the dference between one metre and two metres is the dference between a very small risk and a very tiny risk.To the economy, the dference is a radical one. Shting from two metres to one metre would allow us to get back to something close to business as usual. If you imagine a two-metre circle drawn around any inidual, that takes up  and a half square metres.When you come down to a one-metre safe zone, it is only . square metres. So you could get four times as many people into any given space. With the two-metre rule,  per cent of pubs and bars say it wouldn’t be economically viable to reopen. With four times as many customers, only small pubs would face dficulties.The current approach doesn’t grasp that town centres are leisure destinations and that people won’t go outit is an unpleasant experience. Shoppers want to have a coffee, lunch, try on clothes, it is a social activity with their friends.I believe that cinemas are safe to reopen and that perhaps we might be able to allow some fans back into football stadiums to cheer on their teams again.In a typical cinema, where seating is tiered and there is air conditioning,you do happen to be coughing out, the thermal heat from the bodies should rise it up out into the air conditioning system.Allowing fans to attend football matches again would be a challenge, because of the congestion going into the stadium.They would have to carefully plan entrance and exit times and leave every other seat vacant unless there is a family group, so you would probably be playing in front of a stadium which is  per cent full.I may be part of a faction that favours one metre, but the consensus is that the risk of transmission outside is very low.So joggers don’t have to go into the road to avoid getting too close to someone  on the pavement — because their slipstream will mean the droplets will probably stick to them anyway.The best way to reduce the risk of the virus spreading is a good standard of hygiene, sanitising your hands at the end of a journey and after eating.If you are involved in a lot of customer interactions, such as supermarket checkouts, Perspex barriers are helpful.The Government has taken so much flak on easing lockdown restrictions that they seem to be reluctant to get into a fight on this one. But we need to remember that interrupting the transmission of the virus is not about rules and their enforcement.It is about assessing the risk at each inidual venue, because sticking to two metres in all cases poses a risk to our economic health.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In April we paid off a record £.billion of personal debt and tripled our monthly savings to £.billion. That’s thanks to generous furlough payments, mortgage holidays and saved daily expenses.Far too many think this surreal situation is sustainable. It is not. A huge crash is coming when the bailouts end.The faster weto normality, the less horric its impact will be. WHEN is quarantine not quarantine  When you can still go out — even on the bus.This contradictory fudge is, incredibly, what the Government has come up with, caught between those wanting to lock visitors up for a fortnight and those, like The Sun, who believe that would wreck tourism, our economy and vast numbers of jobs.Quarantining already looks bonkers at this stage. This half-measure is a joke:Restrictive enough to deter most travellers, but not enough to prevent badly infected arrivals from passing Covid on. And farcical enough to further erode trust in the Government.IT should not take George Floyd’s appalling murder and the ensuing protests to remind the world that black lives matter.That sentiment was also why it was vital for Public Health England to find out exactly why BAME people have a higher risk of dying from Covid — and to recommend counter-measures.Why didn’t it  The PHE report just restates what we knew.

Black lives matter”. But despite invoking the slogan which has dominated headlines in recent weeks as protests continue in the US and around the world following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, Mr Hancock did not announce any new measures to protect against those communities most at risk from coronavirus. Hancock said those from BAME communities worried about ing to work should consult the safety at work guidance published by the Government. The number one thing Iaposd say for anybody in a higher risk group, the most important thing to do is stringently follow the social distancing guides, including the work on social distancing at work that has been published, he said. There is specic guidance for social distancing in the workplace. He confirmed that Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch had been tasked with leading on the Governmentaposs response to the PHE report and what further could be done. Mr Hancock said: There is much more work to be done and the report shows that. But he could not give a timetable for recommendations to protect those at risk - particularly BAME workers on the frontline.The Public Health Englandreview found people of Bangladeshi ethnicity had around twice the risk of death as people of white British ethnicity, while people of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, other Asian, Caribbean and black ethnicity had between a % and % higher risk of death. Professor Gurch Randhawa, Professor of Diversity in Public Health and Director of the Institute for Health Research at the University of Bedfordshire, says the report fails to make recommendations to improve the situation it documents, despite this being its original brief: “Sadly, but predictably, the report does a wonderful job of setting out the inequalities experienced by dferent communities under COVID-, but that is just about as far as it goes. Unfortunately, the report makes no recommendations as to how the situation should be addressed, even though providing such recommendations was a key part of its original remit. “The report is completely silent on the obligations of government and other public sector bodies to ensure COVID- policy responses adhere to the Public Sector Equality Duty. It is also silent on the urgent need for Equality Impact Assessments to inform all future policy planning to ensure protection for all members of the public, regardless of race or ethnicity. “This omission can best be described as a lack of humility and honesty in learning from our past actions. It is vital that the government learns lessons from its early missteps in order to prevent a rise in health inequality being one of the principal outcomes of the COVID- pandemic.” The report prompted a backlash against the governmentaposs handling of the crisis. Windrush campaigner Patrick Vernon accused the Government of taking a colour blind approach in tackling Covid-. The former Hackney Labour councillor, said a public inquiry needed to be launched to fully assess the impact of coronavirus on BAME communities. He said: What we need now is a public inquiry with evidence from frontline staff, families and experts to give context to the data. He said the PHE review highlighted the contribution made by BAME people in UK society as he pointed to the large number of deaths among frontline workers who were from those communities.  To help bereaved families who have lost loved ones to Covid-, Mr Vernon launched a fundraising page on GoFundMe to provide grants for memorial events, which has so far raised more than £,. Mr Vernon accused the Government of failing to undertake a proper impact assessment into how Covid- affected BAME groups, saying this was also the case when looking at the impact on care homes.  The report highlights that BAME lives matter, and the Government should no longer take the colour blind approach any more, he said.  At the beginning of the pandemic they said coronavirus does not discriminate, but the impact of it does discriminate - they didnapost look at the risks that it posed on BAME people. The PHE report said the relationship between ethnicity and health is complex and likely to be the result of a combination of factors. For example, BAME people are likely to be at increased risk of acquiring the infection due to the fact they are more likely to live in urban areas, in overcrowded households, in deprived areas, and have jobs that expose them to higher risk, the study said.

Now Tommy Collins is a symbol of hope for the Mirror-backed scheme, in which everyone in England is a potential donor after they die unless they opt out. Among the first to praise the new legislation were Tommy’s parents Alfie Collins and Maisie Davies. Dad Alfie,  – who donated a slice of liver for his son’s op – said: “We’d waited so long for a donor and in the end it felt right that I underwent the transplant for my boy. Actually I was a perfect match. The liver will grow in Tommy like a normal one and my own will regenerate inside me. It’s the body’s only organ that can do so.” He said the transplant has “transformed” le for Tommy, whose rare liver disease made him produce too much ammonia. That affected his brain, leaving him subject to fits.The transplant was conducted at King’s College Hospital in London on April  after being postponed because staff there were so busy battling the coronavirus crisis. There was a late drama when another donor was found as Alfie lay unconscious ready for the operation but surgeons opted to proceed after two earlier ones had proved to be unsuitable.Mum Maisie, , said she will never forget seeing “my two boys” head off for the operating theatre. “I prayed they would be safe,” added Maisie, who gave birth to Tommy at St Thomas’ Hospital where she is a receptionist. “This has given Tommy a new lease of le.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus live uk lockdown updates","story":"\"liveBlogUpdate\": [coronavirus pandemic.

The new guidance only applies to mortgages - not other consumer credit products which are covered separately. The FCA said the consumer credit product guidance will be updated in due course. Generally, mortgage interest still builds up during a payment holiday, unless the lender says otherwise, and the outstanding debt will still be owed by the borrower.

A police cordon was in place near Kingaposs Parade throughout most of Friday while authorities worked together to establish how they would remove the whale. The beach was closed for four miles between Holland-on-Sea and Jaywick to ensure members of the public were not at risk of infection, as The British Divers Marine Le Rescuewarned may be the casepeople came into contact with it. In a statement, the BDMLR said: The animal was already dead when found, BDMLR Medics attended only to gather photographs and other details on its condition that will be passed to our colleagues at the Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme - UK strandings. We believe it is a fin whale and is approximately ft long, which is rather small for this species as they can grow to over ft, and therefore this animal is a juvenile. Removal of the carcass is the responsibility of the beach owner. In the meantime, we strongly advise people avoid going near it as there is a risk of contracting an infection from contact with its bodily fluids or the body itself. On Saturday authorities worked together to remove the Whale carcass as safely and quickly as possible.Witnesses described seeing sections of the carcass being put into containers, a police cordon remained in place while the animal was removed. On Monday, Tendring District Council issued an update on the tragic incident.

Evelyn was shielding at home in March during the first week of lockdown when she got up to make a cup of tea, fell and fractured both of her legs. Evelyn, was laid helpless on her living room floor waiting for help for three hours. Her family were alerted after the care company became worried when she did not pick up the phone. The care company called her granddaughter, Melanie Maw, who sent her son-in-law to check on Evelyn. Melanie said: My daughter is shielding but her husband went in the car to her house. We thought she had maybe passed away. He let himself in and she was on the floor in a very strange position. Evelyn was taken to hospital and had surgery on one of her knees which was put into a cage to heal. Her other was put in a cast. Melanie said: She was in hospital for two weeks and she tested negative for Covid. She was put in a care home for rehabilitation and a week later we got a phone call to say she had tested positive. Sheaposd had a really serious fall, an operation, sheaposs had a heart scare, Type  diabetes, a leg ulcer and anaemia. I was thinking, aposSheaposs not going to make it through this.apos  Evelyn was taken to the Needler Ward at Dove House Hospice, which was created to help alleviate pressure on Hullaposs hospitals and to help care for Covid patients. The disease has killed over , people across the UK, and  in Hull and East Yorkshire. Melanie said: When my nana got to Dove House she had a high temperature, the cough, nothing tasted right and a few times when we spoke to her we could hear her chest sounded so wet. They put her on oxygen when she was there. She still has a cough. She had been there for four weeks when she tested negative and then last week they moved her back to the care home and she can now say she has beat Covid. Melanie praised her incredible Nana who has been through so much. She said: We have promised her the earth. Sheaposs called me at times and said, aposI donapost want to dieapos and I said aposYou havenapost gone through all you have for this to finish you off.apos Weaposve promised to decorate her bungalow and she wants a new suite. After all sheaposs been through and how poorly she has been she just wants a new suite. She had ordered one and was waiting for it to come before all of this.  All of the hospital nurses, doctors and staff at the hospital, care home and Dove House have all done a fantastic job. Weaposre so grateful. Evelyn will still be recuperating at the care home for a few more weeks while her legs heal, and despite the lockdown she is still able to keep in touch with her loved ones. Melanie said: Theyaposve put her in a lovely big room. The fact that she got Covid and beat it, I just canapost believe it.It has been horrendous, not being able to visit her but the home have got her set up on a portal so she can see us on a video call but she presses all of the wrong buttons and then gets off Facebook totally.She only has to press the answer button but sheaposs managed to end up on YouTube.

The clip shot by a drone shows the -year-old jumper in black swimming shorts leaping from Durdle Door into the shallow water. Two paddle boarders can be seen coming to his rescue and pulling him onto a large inflatable unicorn before taking him to shore where he was rushed to Southampton hospital. Flatmates Michael Wiley and Dylan Kirkwood, who rescued the man, told the BBC it took five attempts to find him under the water where he was lying on the seabed ft down. Mr Wiley said: He hit the water so hard that he didnapost even come back up to the surface. He went straight down.Do you know who the tombstone er is  Email webnews@mirrorI finally managed to locate him and I could just see a white body on the bottom of the floor. It was so deep that no one could get to him. Heaposd drowned, he was at the bottom of the sea. Iaposd let all of the air out of my lungs and when I got to him I wasnapost sure I was going to make it. The woman who filmed the video said that the man suffered a broken back. He was one of four people who injured themselves jumping from the clfs in Dorset on Saturday. Boris Johnson recently lted lockdown restrictions which allowed people in England to drive to any part of the country as long as they did not stay overnight. This is being blamed on hundreds of sunseekers flocking to Durdle Door over the weekend to enjoy the warm weather.Despite safety concerns, the police were not able to close off the beach to the public because it is privately owned by the Lulworth Estate. Following the incidents on Saturday Dorset Council pleaded with visitors not to come to the area, and put up barriers to an access road in the neighbouring coastal village of West Bexington to try and stop them.But visitors parked up away from the area and walked miles to get to the beach. The leader of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council has written to local MPs and the chief constable of Dorset Police to call for stricter travel rules. Councillor Vikki Slade, said she had witnessed first-hand incidents of people failing to adhere to social distancing rules, illegal parking, widespread barbecues and staff facing abuse when going about their work. She said: Three weeks ago, following the Prime Ministeraposs announcement that people could travel wherever they liked as long as they did not stay out overnight, we discussed the possibility of limiting travel distance, she said.We were told clearly that this was not possible. We have asked the police for extra support in enforcing social distancing and we have been told that we are policed by consent and that this is not practical, and that the capacity of the police makes it impossible to achieve. We have even been asked to stop councillors and residents from calling the police when they have concerns about gatherings, groups and breaches. We saw the most awful scenes in Durdle Door with the arrival of two helicopters to deal with the stupidity of people jumping from the top of clfs, cheered and clapped by thousands of beachgoers.

A former Invictus Games soldier, who asked not to be named, said: “We spoke about the Games, I was very respectful and did not ask him anything about his new le or anything. “He simply said he misses his role with the Marines and would like one day toto the appointment.” The chat is understood to have happened shortly after lockdown began.

He with we Meghan, , the Duchess of Sussex, and their son Archie, one, are living in Los Angeles.

The Sun reports having seen a apossecret blueprintapos to kick start Britainaposs pub trade which has been drawn up by ministers in the Department for Business.Breweries, meanwhile, have ramped up production on kegs of beer - which were stopped at the start of the pandemic to focus on cans and bottles - the newspaper said. The aim is reportedly to deliver  million pints-worth of booze by June  as hopes continue to rise that UK pubs may open sooner than expected. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.    The Governmentaposs guidelines reportedly include Wetherspoon-style app ordering systems to avoid people queuing at the bar, while tables will be placed two metres apart. And while other European countries are urging their pubs to use screens between tables this is said to not have been included in guidelines for Britain - though screens will be available for staff at the bar. It is also understood pubs with outdoor beer gardens could open first as part of a two-stage process.  Under current plans, pubs, hotels and restaurants will remain closed until at least July , but this could soon change.Last week, Boris Johnson told MPs the scientic advisory group for emergencieshad been told to review the guidance about social distancing. Pub trade bodies are currently pleading with the Government to minimise the two metre distancing rule to just one, with many boozers too small to make re-opening worthwhile under current guidelines.This still remains a sticking point, Mr Johnson has admitted, but said work was being done to try and reduce the recommended distance. The boss of British Beer and Pub Associationhas said more than three-quarters of pubs could reopensocial distancing rules were relaxed to one metre.  Chief executive Emma McClarkin warnedthe two-metre guidance remains, just one-third could reopen their doors and many would face further financial misery and ruin.However, a study published in medical journal The Lancet this week suggests cutting social distancing to within m could increase the likelihood of coronavirustransmission by more than four. Many pubs have been taking advantage of recent hot weather and a loosening of the lockdown restrictions to offer takeaway drinks."},{"url":null,"title":"summer holidays back cards relaxation","story":"NewsSummer holidays back on the cards as relaxation of quarantine rules consideredTravel bosses have warned against forcing UK arrivals into quarantine for two weeks and instead pushed for air bridges with  countries where coronavirus is under control, including Spain, Portugal and GreeceShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JUN NewsSummer holidays are back on the cards as the Government considers relaxing quarantine rules \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Government was considering relaxing border quarantine rules before they had even come into force. As travel bosses warned forcing UK arrivals into quarantine for two weeks would be a “disaster”, airlines pressed for “air bridges” with  countries where the virus is under control, including Spain, Portugal and Greece. Travellers ing from those nations would not have to isolate.PM Boris Johnson is pressing ahead with border quarantine plans as of Monday, despite a growing backlash.But No confirmed the rules will be reviewed after three weeks, which could lead to exemptions for some popular holiday destinations. And it would be in time for school holidays. At tonight’s No briefing, Mr Hancock said he was growing “more optimistic” about the prospect of Brits taking holidays abroad this year. But he said: “Clearly the number one priority is keeping the public safe. “That is the overriding principle and it has been throughout this.” Later Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: “These measures will be reviewed every few weeks, and we are working to see how we can introduce agreements with other countries when safe to do so, so we can go abroad and tourists can come here.” George Morgan-Grenville, CEO of tour firm Red Savannah, accused the Government of “ignoring the devastation” the quarantine plan would cause.  He said: “By pursuing its quarantine plans without due regard for the economic consequences, the Government is choosing to ignore the devastation it will cause to companies, to employment and to the lives of all those whose jobs will be lost. “The quarantine measures are a blunt weapon which will bring only economic disaster.” EasyJet today revealed it plans to resume flights on as many as half of its routes by the end of July, and almost a quarter of Majorca’s , hotels expect to reopen next month, something local tourism chiefs said was an “unthinkable turnaround” from a month ago. At the end of June, , German tourists will be invited to the island to test new safety protocols. And many Brits are still planning a  getaway, a poll suggests. More than half said they still intended to go on holiday later this year, despite Foreign Office guidelines advising against all-but-essential travel overseas. More than % of the , people quizzed by travel insurance provider Just Travel Cover had not been put off travelling abroad by the pandemic, despite more than half having holiday plans cancelled. Andrew Jackson, MD of the insurance broker, said: “This survey gives us reason to be optimistic.”  Home Secretary Priti Patel is expected to unveil full details of the quarantine plan in Parliament today . Early reports suggest people heading for quarantine will be allowed to take public transport and go outside for food shopping. The PM’s spokesman said: “I think there will be a limited set of exemptions, just as there was during the nationwide lockdown...they need urgent medical treatment, support from social services, food or medicine which they cannot get delivered, or to attend a funeral of a close relative.” He said air bridges were “something the Government is looking at”. Policy was focused on stopping “imported cases of this virus” and, he said, “one of the most devastating things which could happen to the economy is to have a second spike”.  The Home Office said people arriving in Britain would be contacted at random to ensure they are following orders – with rulebreakers facing a £, fine. Testing chief Professor John Newton said rules could be easedthe Test and Trace system was successful. He said: “If travellers are able to be tested and self-isolate in response to contact tracing just like a domestic new case, that would be another way of dealing with it. “At the moment caution has won the day.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mums bella hadid lockdown fringe","story":"NewsMums Bella Hadid lockdown fringe attempt is so bad people are hoping its fakeCeleste Barber, an Australian mum and comedian, tried to give herself a new lockdown do inspired by supermodel Bella Hadid, but it was a bit of a failShareCommentsByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience Writer:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror am video bella-hadids-fringe-mocked-perfectly-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,newGrid:true,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,newGrid:true,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news weird-news mums-bella-hadid-lockdown-fringe-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It was then his parents took it upon themselves to take their fledgling infant to a second hospital to be tested and a coronavirus diagnosis was confirmed.

Ms Micher did not realise that her webcam was still running, prompting screenshots of the mishap to circulate on social media. The senator apologised for the mishap but was clear that she had nothing to be ashamed of. She said: “I am Malu Micher, and I am not ashamed to have shown part of my intimacy by accident, because it is exactly the notion that a woman is ‘just her body’ that has allowed and fomented the objectication of women against which I have always fought. “I am a woman of  years of age who has breastfed four children, three of whom are today professional and responsible men, and I feel proud of my body for having nourished them. “I am a woman who has fought for the left for almost  years and who has occupied ious public roles in my fervent commitment for the defence of human rights, I am a woman who is not ashamed of her body, I love it and I take care of it.” Many other colleagues and politicians also retweeted her letter and posted on social media to show their support for the senator. Fellow senator Ricardo Monreal Avila wrote: “In view of the attacks against her, a product of a mishap during a virtual meeting, we endorse our fellowship.  Morals and integrity will always be stronger than infamy and assaults.” Another senator, Maria Elena Morena posted: “The rubbish stinks in the senate and on social media.

I love you!mdash ChefDeanBanksMay , #From that, it evolved into something that I love doing and that#s my lobster box. The lobster itself is my signature dish that we do in the restaurant.#A good friend of mine, Ross McGregor, helped with our online presence. Within a week of him coming on board, the sales for Haar went from  boxes to  boxes. Without him I don#t think we#d be where we are.#We started delivering locally and were doing around   boxes a week and we were getting lots of comments from people in Edinburgh and Glasgow saying they#d love to be able to get a delivery there.#We said,we can get a minimum number of orders in Edinburgh we#ll go ahead and deliver more widely, and within the first week we had  orders.#It#s been amazing since then. It has grown arms and legs and we#re up to  boxes this week.#The minefield of national is that we#re at the point now where we#re growing beyond the capacity of my restaurant.#We#re looking at other avenues and at the possibility of renting a unit somewhere to be used, growing the staff, or bringing all the staff back from furlough. vw, px\"  #We#ve kind of plateaued at where we are with the  boxes a week but now we#re looking to expand it because there#s a lot of people asking for it nationally.

I think I#ve evolved and grown as a chef and as a business owner.#I#m usually worried about the food leaving the pass and getting to the table, whereas now I#m worried about the food leaving the front door and getting to someone#s home.#The nightmare of logistics surrounding delivery is just something I never expected to run into.#I hold my hands up in praise to any delivery driver the job they do is amazing and the stress behind it is unbelievable.#I definitely want to continue this in the future. We#ve already built in plans to segregate it from Haar restaurant so that it#s its own entity. We want to have a unit up and running so that when Haar does open we can keep it going.#Even with the restrictions being softened, I think there#s still a massive need for this sort of thing at home.#My repertoire of being a chef, having a restaurant and knowing where my produce comes from is now becoming this great thing that I can use for Haar at Home.#This week we#ve got six boats fishing for lobsters just for us one in St Andrews, two in Arbroath and three in the Outer Hebrides.#It#s nice that we can help support our local fishing fleet because the market has obviously dropped off.#Dean says that at the beginning of the pandemic he felt #down in the dumps,# unsure about what to do with himself.But after successfully creating home cocktail videos for his gin brand, Lunun, he felt a renewed sense of purpose to remain focused and keep going.He said: #I started doing home videos for my gin brand, Lunun, of me making cocktails. That boomed and sales on our website went up ,%.#That was the incentive of me realising I needed to keep everything going and that I couldn#t just stall.#I want to survive by myself so I needed to think about how I can create something that would keep me going.#Providing for everyone locally is a great thing, but logistically it#s getting too big for me to be able to handle.#I think, in the future, we might have some complaints thatwe go national we might be shunning off the local people.#That#s not the case. They can still collect from the restaurant and order off the website. But the logistics are getting too big for a chef to handle.#Haar at Home is currently providing boxes to Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, St Andrews, Carnoustie, Cupar, Arbroath and places in between.

asked the social media giant to ease restrictions on firms’ Facebook pages in order for them to be seen by the largest number of people as possible.It comes as DCT Thomson and the Evening Express editorial and commercial teams have been working with more than  businesses to help and support their inidual needs through this pandemic.Aberdeen Inspired is also calling for a meeting with Facebook to discuss ways in which the US company can assist struggling businesses.The letter has also been sent to Chancellor Rishi Sunak to ask for his support on the matter.Aberdeen Inspired has asked the social media company to temporarily increase the reach of posts by businesses so that it can reach all followers with news of re-opening and hygiene measures.Chief executive of Aberdeen Inspired Adrian Watson said: #Towns and city centre businesses are now going through a painful transition, small businesses have to pay to expand their reach when they are already struggling.“Media outlets are helping with that, DC Thomson is a good example, it’s happening across media outlets across the world.#Many of us have battled through both personal and business pain over the past few months and rightly followed the lockdown guidelines put in place to protect the NHS and save lives.“Many businesses have spent years and many thousands of pounds building up their followers and page likes on social media s like Facebook and Instagram.“As businesses reopen, almost all will have critical safety messages to communicate with the public regarding social distancing and hygiene measures. Should Facebook continue to limit reach, these messages could be missed, potentially putting people in harm’s way.“We have written to Facebook asking them to change their algorithm or give free post boosts to businesses for up to  months.  Even short-term help would be welcomed by businesses, given that Facebook has become the primary communication channel for a vast number of organisations.”David Groundwater, development manager at the Federation of Small Businesses, said DC Thomson has been providing support and marketing opportunities for firms and Facebook and social media in general also has a part to play.He said:  “As we gradually move out of lockdown and to a new normal, many businesses will be keen to not only demonstrate the steps they have taken to meet social requirements, but also that they’re once again open for business.“We’ve been pleased to support marketing opportunities and support via the DC Thomson titles across the country. Additionally, in the last month, we’ve helped small businesses across the UK access £. million In tailored advertising.“Online marketing through s such as Facebook and Instagram will play an important role for many, but our research shows that almost a quarter of small business owners believe a lack of basic digital skills amongst them and their staff is holding them back from boosting their digital and online presence.“At this time, it is critical that businesses improve their reach and visibility of products and services.”Facebook has said the more people are active and engaged with stories that appear in their news feed, the more likely they are to be active and engaged with content from businesses. Posts are prioritised based on ranking factors for each inidual user.The social media firm also said it has taken a number of steps to support businesses during Covid-, including launching Facebook Shops to #relieve some of the pressures businesses are facing right now# and setting up a resource hub to help small and medium businesses which provides recommendations and training resources on how to keep customers connected.Phil Prentice, Chief Executive Officer of Scotland’s Towns Partnership and National Programme Director for Scotland’s Improvement Districts added, “Facebook often faces questions around transparency and taxation, perhaps they could improve their image by providing some payback to the thousands of small Scottish businesses who in better times have paid handsomely for advertising and boosting a simple measure to protect future revenue streams while helping wider society should be a no brainer for Facebook to agree to”.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/04/5ae43fe11dd90-423x564.jpg ","title":"north east msp calls for increased support for oil and gas sector","story":"A north-east MSP is calling for increased support for the oil and gas sector amid the Covid- pandemic.Labour’s Lewis Macdonald has lodged a motion at the Scottish Parliament to highlight the challenges faced by the industry.Trade body Oil and Gas UK has predicted as many as , jobs could be lost over the next  months because of a drop in oil prices during the coronavirus crisis.Mr Macdonald is also calling for the Scottish Government to set up its Energy Task Force, which was established to protect oil and gas jobs but it was stood down in .He is also backing Unite the union’s Save Offshore jobs campaign and the union has warned that tens of thousands of jobs are at risk with upwards of , workers immediately at risk through redundancies or furloughing by September.Mr Macdonald said: “I fully support Unite’s Save Offshore jobs campaign and their call for public investment in the industry which is of huge importance to the wider Scottish economy.“The challenges currently facing the oil and gas industry are immense. There is an immediate threat to the industry due to the collapse in demand brought on by the pandemic.“But we also need a plan to protect jobs in the medium to long-term. This is why I have called on the Scottish Government to re-establish the Energy Jobs Taskforce.“We need a permanent forum for joint working among energy companies, trade unions and government agencies to protect existing jobs, support an energy transition and promote future growth.”Mr Macdonald’s Holyrood motion asks the parliament to agree that the combination of low oil prices and Covid- is an “existential threat” to North Sea oil and gas.It also calls on the UK and Scottish governments to provide support to the industry to protect jobs and skills, production, investment, decommissioning and tax revenue.Unite Scottish Secretary, Pat Rafferty, welcomed the support from Mr Macdonald and wants more action for the oil and gas industry.He said: “Unite welcomes Lewis Macdonald’s parliamentary motion drawing attention to the challenges facing the oil and gas sector.“Scotland’s economy faces a long period of getting back to some form of normality after the Covid- pandemic subsides, but the north-east and the islands will be one of the areas hardest hit.#It’s vital that specic measures are brought forward to stabilise the sector and to support those areas in greatest need. We hope that this motion further focuses the minds of all parliamentarians on the need for implementing a plan which saves offshore jobs.”Scottish Energy Minister, Paul Wheelhouse, said:“This is an extremely dficult time for our business community and we have recognised from the outset the need to do all we can to help key sectors recover.“The oil and gas industry is a critical component the Scottish economy, employing more than , directly and indirectly and I will seek to engage with all MSPs on the actions we are taking to support it as it responds to Covid- impacts and headwinds in oil and gas markets.#However, in addition, as set out in our  Scottish Energy Strategy, the sector has a crucial role to play in the energy transition required to move to an economy and society that generates net zero greenhouse gas emissions.“These factors underpin why I have recently chaired two meetings of the Oil and Gas, and Energy Transition Strategic Leadership Group, which includes key stakeholders in the industry, that will move to a monthly frequency to monitor the impact of the downturn and identy practical actions to support the sector and, critically, its workforce.#The SLG will, for the foreseeable future, also seek to complement and reinforce work already underway through the OGUK Pandemic Steering Group, the Oil and Gas Authority’s Supply Chain and Exports Taskforce, and the Energy Skills Alliance, to identy any gaps in support and opportunities to stimulate supply chain activity.“The refocused SLG, which involves the Oil  Gas Authority, Oil  Gas UK, trades unions, enterprise agencies, offshore operators, downstream sector representatives and supply chain companies and wider industry representatives, as well as the Oil and Gas Technology Centre and Opportunity North East, held its first virtual meeting on April nd and following on from that has, at its second meeting on  May  adopted a taskforce approach that will focus on the Covid- response the longer term economic response to take account of the potential for a ‘low price for longer’ environment and to seek to identy actions to deliver the industry’s Roadmap , a blueprint for net-zero emissions from production activity.“Many of the key levers needed to support the sector are reserved to the UK Parliament, and we will seek to work closely with the UK Government to ensure both governments are doing all they can to protect jobs and retain vital skills.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/06/2.48751243-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/06/2.48751243-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/06/2.48751243-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/06/2.48751243-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"praise for residents as north east recycling centres open","story":"North-east residents have been praised for their response after recycling centres opened across the region.Aberdeenshire Council opened its facilities on Monday, with more than , bookings made for the first week of operation #

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

litter they see next to paths or along roadside verges.ldquoWersquore lucky in Selkirk to have such unspoilt countryside to exercise in, so itrsquos a shame to see it spoiled by discarded empty bottles, food wrappers and general rubbish.ldquoI kicked off the campaign by nominating three members of our players ndash Aaron McColm, Ewan MacDougall and Liam Cassidy ndash to collect litter on their walks.ldquoEach of this trio will then challenge a further three players to collect litter, and in turn these three will nominate other team-mates, and so on.The project has the backing of

for the clubrsquos coaches, players and rugby officials to be digitally linked via Zoom, with Selkirk head coach Scott Wight taking charge of proceedings.ldquoThe idea is to try and stick as closely

These allow vets to make the best diagnosis possible and give advice or treatment whichever is required.Medications and prescriptions can be collected from the Tranent surgery or posted or delivered via courier to clients.Reception staff are extremely busy as they have to determine which category the phone call falls into. There is no such thing as making a basic appointment now. Everything takes much longer to discuss and consequently sometimes the telephone system is overwhelmed.You can, of course, leave a message or send an email, contact websites or Facebook pages. Someone will respond to your question as soon as possible. The reception team are doing a wonderful job, as of course they are at all veterinary practices. They are our frontline heroes who deserve special applause.At Dunedin Vets, we are now seeing more emergency cases after triage.Dogs and cats who are now almost three months overdue their boosters can now have them. This will prevent them having to restart their vaccine course and means their owners only having to visit the practice once.All pups and kittens who had first vaccines before lockdown should have had their second vaccines now. Pups can start vaccine courses as long as they have been in their new home for at least one week, are over ten weeks old and their owners are not self- isolating.We are trying to delay kittensrsquo vaccinations as long as possible ndash especiallythey are not going out.We will try to do one vaccine at neutering time, to reduce the number of visits. If your rabbit is due boosters just now, as many rabbits are, prior to going outdoors, both vaccines can be given at the same time rather than two weeks apart ndash again reducing the number of outings to the surgery. Clients are not allowed in the surgery, having smaller animals in cages and dogs on leads helps in the handover of pets.I am sure all veterinary practices have been thinking about when we can have clients back in the surgery.At Dunedin Vets, we will have safety shields on reception desks and distancing stickers as well as hazard tape on the floor. Staff will be wearing masks and visors and there will be a limit to the numbers of clients allowed in the surgery at any one time.Hopefully we can open our other branches and have all our staff back at work soon. Until then we continue doing as we are doing and keeping everyone safe.During this period of lockdown there have been some ongoing cases which have required regular treatment, examinations and blood tests. These include diabetics, dogs with Addisonrsquos or Cushingrsquos conditions and cats with blood pressure and thyroid problems as well as those with heart conditions.One patient who had to be seen throughout this time is Buri.Buri is a four-year-old German Shepherd dog belonging to Mrs Sarah McHale and family who visit our Dunbar surgery.In November , Buri was seen at Dunbar with an apparent urinary tract infection. He had been drinking more and going to the toilet lots. When examined, he was a fit, lively dog, but had several large lymph nodes under his neck.Rhiannon the vet took a sample from the glands which I examined under the microscope. I found some large, unusual cells. Buri came for a biopsy under anaesthetic.The samples were sent to a laboratory for testing and unfortunately the results were not good. Buri had lymphoma, a cancer of blood cells which results in enlargement of lymph nodes. This is a form of cancer which we can treat in practice with chemotherapy.The particular type of lymphoma Buri had would respond better to a drug he needed to have at Edinburgh Vet School. So for the next five months, every week Buri attended either our Tranent branch for one type of chemotherapy and sometimes to the Vet School at Penicuik for the other.He had to take tablets every day as well. He had numerous blood tests to check his blood count and to check all his organs were ing well. He also had urine samples checked to make sure no problem was developing.He was such a good lad. He had to be away from his family when the chemotherapy was being administered.Vet Jonny and nurse Fiona, dressed in their chemotherapy PPE, became his best friends. He seemed to love coming to the surgery bouncing about and wanting to play with everyone.He responded very well to his treatment. His lymph nodes reduced rapidly. He remained happy and healthy, eating well and had very few side effects from the chemotherapy. The weeks wore on and Buri became a regular at the surgery, usually on a Tuesday afternoon, when all the staff looked out for him.When lockdown came, we received a message from the Vet School that they were unable to carry out further chemotherapy treatments.Buri was at the end of his treatment there.We continued to give him his chemotherapy for three more weeks, when on April , he received his very last dose.He was still the happy boy we adored. We decided to ring that final chemo bell and give him a round of applause which he justly deserved.His mum had to stay at home self- isolating but we shared a video and photos with her, which she loved.She was happy for us to spread the good news and our Facebook video post went viral.No doubt Buri will have ups and downs and may require further treatment but we wish Buri and his family every good wish for the future.Stay safe everyone."},{"url":null,"title":"column-qmus-important-research-role","story":"NICOLA Sturgeon has now released the Scottish Governmentrsquos lsquoroute maprsquo for leading us through the Covid- crisis, which is available for everyone to read on the Scottish Governmentrsquos website.As of today , we will begin to work through the phases of our gradual emergence out of lockdown.Whilst we all want to get back to normality, it is important that we strike a balance between protecting the publicrsquos health but also in allowing people to have inidual freedoms.In phase one, you will be able to meet with one other household at a two-metre distance, as long as it is outside, and many outdoor sports such as golf and tennis will be permitted.The overall message remains: stay as home as much as we can, to avoid a second wave.I would like to congratulate Queen Margaret University on being awarded pound, from the Scottish Government to support it in rapid coronavirus research.This will be sure to play a signicant role across Scotland in understanding the effect that the virus will have.Research such as this is fundamentally important in developing policies and treatment for Covid- and this will undoubtedly contribute to saving lives.To commend this good news, I have submitted a congratulatory motion to my colleagues in the Scottish Parliament and I hope this will be well supported by them.I would like to thank QMU for undertaking this work, and wish the researchers working in this area all the best.I would like to thank community councils for all their work in supporting the local area through this challenging time.I know that many have been making efforts to ensure people have access to food, prescriptions and also emotional support.Our community councils often make huge dferences in our community but receive little recognition for their hard work."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-communities-aberlady-gifford-haddington-athelstaneford-longniddry-macmerry-gladsmuir-ormiston","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at six of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Aberlady.

But it will remain for some time I suspect.My thoughts on the beach the other day drted to my older kids, who I have been unable to see because they are on the other side of that invisible fence.Then I remembered a scene in a novel I read when I was at high school.The novel was Lord of the Flies by William Golding.It left a deep impression on me at the time.The story is about a group of boys who are stranded on an uninhabited island after an airplane crash.They are without any adults, and so they must organise and govern themselves in order to survive.At first they do this by having rules and symbols of authority that everyone respects.One of the boys finds a conchand itrsquos used to give democratic order to discussions.A boy called Ralph tries to maintain this semblance of order and fairness, but it all starts to break down.Gradually, the modes of behaviour they learnt in society before the crash erode, as some of the boys realise they can now do what they want.The scene from the novel which I remembered describes how one of the older boys, called Roger, throws stones close to a younger boy named Henry, who is playing on the beach.He wants to hit him, but he doesnrsquot.Golding explains why: ldquoRoger gathered a handful of stones and began to throw them.ldquoYet there was a space round Henry, perhaps six yards in diameter, into which he dare not throw.ldquoHere, invisible yet strong, was the taboo of the old le. Round the squatting child was the protection of parents and school and policemen and the law.Later of course, Roger finally rejects these taboos of the old le, and actually kills another boy with a rock.By this time, the new society created by the boys on the island has become cruel and despotic.The conch has been smashed and a boy called Jack has become a power crazed leader, ruling with terror.At its core, the novelrsquos message is a very pessimistic one that when the constraints imposed by commonly agreed standards of behaviour and humanitarian respect are removed, people will descend into uncaring and savage norms of behaviour, led by power crazed rulers.The novel was criticised for this pessimism, but of course there are many examples in history, and in current times, of despotic cruel regimes and societies.But my thoughts on this, as I played with my younger kids on the beach, were that there are more good folk in this world whose collective will has made those boundaries and keep them in place.I see it all around me people in communities creating norms of kindness, consideration and care.Yes, therersquos rudeness, selfishness and aggression too, but every smile, every kind act, every respectful exchange dilutes them and helps shore up the norms of a caring society.That protective invisible fence we currently have around ourselves is a product of our care for others as well as for ourselves.What gives it strength is not so much enforcement, but the understanding that for the benefit of others we sometimes canrsquot, or shouldnrsquot, just do what we want.Integrity and honesty are the cornerstones of this.We can disagree on objectives and priorities, but without these values our conch is broken.I have had some discussions with my youngest daughter recently about the importance of owning your actions and taking responsibility. Shersquos six and she gets it.These were my thoughts as I walked the Pans shore with my youngest kids.But I was thankfully taken out of them by my wee boy, who is currently obsessed with King Kong.He asked me: ldquoIs that island over there where King Kong lives "},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-open-take-place-renaissance-club-october","story":"The impact of the coronavirus saw the Aberdeen Standard Investments Scottish Open postponed last month.However, the European Tour has now confirmed that the tournament, which will be played at The Renaissance Club, near Archerfield, will take place from October -.Keith Pelley, European Tour Chief Executive, said: ldquoSince the suspension of our  season in early March, we have taken a measured approach in reassessing our schedule, informed every step of the way by our medical advisers and government guidance.ldquoWe have consistently said that safety is our absolute priority and that is why today we are announcing our resumption in two monthsrsquo time supported by a comprehensive health strategy which has been led by our medical team.ldquoWithout question we have had to think dferently about the remainder of our  season which is reflected in todayrsquos announcement.ldquoAs golfrsquos global Tour, ersity is ordinarily one of our biggest strengths, but in this instance it has become one of our biggest challenges.ldquoInitially, therefore, based on the expert guidance we received, playing in clusters, in one territory, is the best option in terms of testing, travel and accommodation.It is the second year in a row that the competition has been played at the East Lothian course.Last yearrsquos event was won by Bernd Wiesberger after a play-off with Benjamin Hebert.Currently, the Aberdeen Standard Investments Ladies Scottish Open is pencilled in for August - at the same venue.Last yearrsquos event was won by Mi Jung Hur."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-communities-cockenzie-port-seton-humbie-east-west-saltoun-bolton-musselburgh-prestonpans-tranent-elphinstone","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at five of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port Seton.

This can lead to problems starting your car when it comes time to get back to work. Better keep those jump leads handy.Rustybrake discsA rusty brake disc can be a real problem.When your car is being usedregularly, your brake discs can take care of themselves - but when left standing for too long, they can rust.This happens when rain falls on your brake discs and is left to dry out.Normally any surface rust comes off through using your brakes the next time you drive, but when the cars off the road this doesnt happen and repeated soaking and drying can cause the rust to build up and badly damage the brake discs.Fortunately most of the country has enjoyed mostly dry weather during this lockdown so - butyou think your brakes arent working as they should, you need to get them checked out urgently.Flat tyresIm sure it wasnt like this when I parked it.If youve got a slow puncture, it can take quite a while before your tyre deflates enough to be noticeable. If you had one before you stopped driving, by now it could well be completely flat. Before setting out on your journey, check your tyre pressures to make sure theyre all still safe.Low oilOver a long period of a car not moving, oil can start draining down through the system into the sump.

Prior to lockdown, Britain managed just % of journeys by bike.And there are lingering concerns that the rise in cycling may be offset by people who would normally use public transport choosing to travel by car instead.ldquoTherersquos no doubt therersquos an increase in cyclists, but Irsquom not convinced itrsquos driven by anything more than leisure and keeping fit, he says. ldquoThere seems to be a big rush to change things when we donrsquot know what the new normal is.ldquoWhen people do go back to work, they will still be living in suburbs, theyrsquoll still work in dferent parts of the city, and still want to get around.

If there are only a few flowers then we suggest they are better enjoyed by observing rather than picking.ldquoIt is, however, an offence to dig up or remove any wild plant without the permission of the landowner and there are also special protections in place for some more rare or vulnerable species.Plantle has set out some guidelines for enjoying wildflowers and picking them while out and about exercising.These include only picking from large patches of flowers and picking one flower out of every  and never picking from nature reserves or other protected sites.People should also only pick a small handful of flowers for personal use and avoid trampling on other flowers or vegetation.Plants should never be uprooted without the landownerrsquos permission.Dr Trevor Dines, botanical specialist at Plantle, said: ldquoThere is a prevalent sense that picking wild flowers is a bad thing. Many of us are unsure whatrsquos OK and whatrsquos not and so err on the safe side. Wild flowers donrsquot have to be out of bounds ndash and out of our lives.ldquoContrary to widespread belief, it is not illegal to pick most wild flowers for personal, non-commercial use. In a similar vein, itrsquos not illegal to forage most leaves and berries for food in the countryside for non-commercial use.ldquoActually, we are very used to picking some speciesbut there are other wildflowers that are also very commonplace. Plantle has highlighted twelve wild flowers that are easy to identy and OK to pick. Many ndash like cow parsley, primrose, dog violet and dandelion ndash are actually increasing.A full list of plants to avoid as they are considered protected species can be found at section  of the Wildle and Countryside Act .In Scotland, it can also be considered an offence under common law theft.Gardening expert Chris Bonnett, from gardening website gardeningexpress, said: ldquoYou are allowed to pick flowers which are not privately owned or critically endangered ndash but only one in every twenty, and only from patches where there are lots of flowers, so you leave plenty for others to enjoy.ldquoYou should also leave a substantial amount of the plant to allow it to continue to grow. Donrsquot ever pick flowers in public parks, community gardens, or on National Trust property or nature reserves. This includes flowers from roundabouts, which are maintained by councils.ldquoIntentionally picking, uprooting or destroying a plant without permission from the landowner or occupier is an offence, and you should never pick any flower found in the Schedule  list of protected plants.For guidance on what can and canrsquot be picked and what the law says, visit www.plantle.org.uk uk discover-wild-plants-nature picking-wildflowers-and-the-law.Delightful dozen: Plantlersquos wildflowers you can pickhellipDaisyDandelionPrimroseCommon dog-violetGreater stitchwortCow parsleyMeadow buttercupRed campionOxeye daisyYarrowCommon knapweedMeadowsweet"},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring s Country Life  little people and the tides of time","story":"A couple of boys who live on the green are bicyclists, but by the time we hear their voices they are already far off, like jumbo jets whose roar follows seconds after they have flown by.Hooletrsquos children have never been more conspicuous than in the recent weeks, when their parents take them for their daily pram walk or stroll, or they play in their gardens, making piratical cries. At the bleak end of March, one little girl collected sticks on the green and made a wigwam. This was added to some days later by another familyrsquos three-year-old, who claimed joint ownership. This boy has his own toy strimmer and ear muffs ndash he has already been identied as our future resident handyman.One family, who arrived in the village with a toddler shortly after us, had a baby at the turn of the year. Probably the youngest member of the village, although by a narrow margin, he is slowly getting familiar with it, by pram and papoose. Meanwhile, his sister visits her favourite haunts, or hangs over the garden gate bidding hello to those of us she recognises. She canrsquot know how much that does for our spirits, but she, and others of her age, are making Hoolet their own. Itrsquos immensely cheering.When they are older, theyrsquoll join the other children ferried to nearby schools. Before lockdown, the school bus would pass our kitchen window on its circuitous journey to the secondary school some miles away. Its passengers seemed to sit as far from each other as possible, absorbed on their phones. If they ever looked our way, would they feel envious of those pouring a second mug of tea, and enjoying a leisurely start to the day rather than facing a double dose of chemistry Not long after we arrived here, I was shown a photo of the village from around . In front of our cottage, in the wide, dusty road, were a handful of schoolgirls. In their crisp white pinafores and straw hats, they looked like illustrations from Little Women. Just up the street is the old schoolhouse, whose plaque tells passers-by it was built in .An earlier school had  fee-paying students and records show that in , Hoolet boasted that by the age of six, everyone could read and write. Older pupils were also taught French, Greek, geography and Latin, although they might have been too cold to concentrate. Apparently in winter the schoolroom temperature plummeted so low that ink in the ink wells would freeze. That aspect of Hoolet is still recognisable. When nearby towns have sleet and rain, we get snow and ice.Photographs from the early s show dozens of neatly dressed pupils by the school, girls dancing hand in hand in a ring, boys running here and there, doubtless kicking a ball or stone. The school closed for good during the Second World War, and has since been a post office, library and shop. Itrsquos the typically chequered career of a building at the heart of many small communities and, equally typically, is now just a desirable property.That glimpse of pinafored schoolgirls by our cottage has stayed with me. In many old snaps the village children are either posed in their classroom outfits, or caught accidentally in passing. In one, from , a fishmonger, smartly dressed in hat and long jacket, has drawn up his horse and trap a few doors from our house. He is handing a parcel to a woman gracefully dressed in a long skirt and blouse.Coming up the road behind is a young lad, barefoot, his trousers short as a sailorrsquos. Did he, or one of the schoolgirls with ribbons in their hair, live in our house  Did they survive the war or the Spanish Flu There are several photos of our cottage from those times which I find unexpectedly eery. You realise how short your occupancy is, and how a house has a le much longer and far-reaching than yours. In these pictures, cows are often grazing on the green, and chickens roam freely. There was a lamppost right outside our gate, almost identical to the one in Narnia. It had a white picket fence in those days, and a steep thatched roof whose grass sprouts on the ridgepole like a horsersquos mane.Roses clamber up the front, but itrsquos pretty scruffy, the walls in need of patching up. Back then, country cottages were neither desirable nor chi-chi. Those with money lived in the mill-ownersrsquo villas, on the south side of Hoolet, mansions maintained by an army of servants.At the back of our cottage was an old cart-house and the corner of the front wall is cut away to allow wagons and traps to scrape past. After this it became a cobblerrsquos. Now it contains my husbandrsquos books, some on floor-to-ceiling bookcases, others simply on the floor, and almost as many stacked in the loft overhead, begging to be shelved.If any villagers from the eve of the First World War ed to Hoolet, theyrsquod recognise it at once. Although there are modern houses, the same old properties line the green and the main street. Unlike in their day, however, it would be hard to survive here without a car or electric bike. Despite the resurgence of local and online deliveries, the village is no longer self-sufficient. It is not a community as its former inhabitants would have understood it.The tide is turning, though, as people appreciate the benefits of country living. Perhaps in our post-pandemic world places likes Hoolet will continue to become more self-reliant and inventively independent. Even so, the chances are that children raised here will leave at some point.

I do hope that in this context the UK Government is mindful of the widespread criticism targeted at it regarding the handling of the outbreak. I consider that this should be reflected on how Westminster and indeed Holyrood inform themselves and set about framing their fiscal policies over the next few years. They cannot expect the general public to keep tightening their belts without setting a better example than they have so far in preventing the crisis.Major investment in multibillion-pound projects such as Crossrail in London are so far advanced as to warrant continuation. Strategically a similar argument could be made for completing Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. Although it is probably too late to cancel HS, I fully expect that the project will be re-phased. Several other major projects are worthy of review.However, I do suggest the plan that in  years time, we ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars, should be at least postponed. The enormous cost of designing and having in place a national infrastructure and generating capacity to serve and make viable electric vehicles will come when we are still recovering from the economic disaster which Covid- has brought.I am aware of the economic school of thought which suggests public spending should be increased at this time, but I feel that the unprecedented nature of what has happened ndash effectively shutting the UK down since the middle of March ndash perhaps suggests the need for a more cautious and conventional approach to housekeeping.Bill Brown, Milngavie.I NOTE with interest your report on Scotlands funding needs . Im sure many iniduals, and governments, would always welcome more money, especially at this time, but perhaps Kate Forbes can tell us where the money allocated from the UK Government so far has been spent, how much remains unallocated, and what is planned for this balance. It would also be helpful to know how she would have funded this crisis had Scotland been independent.Stewart Little, Bridge of Weir.DOUGLAS Coweasks where Nicola Sturgeon would have gone for financial support during the pandemic should Scotland have become independent after the  referendum. The answer is pretty straightforward she would have done as leaders of other similarly sized countries have done.I donrsquot compare Scotland with Norway, since that country didnrsquot squander its oil reserves as the UK has done, but can look to Denmark, Finland and Slovakia for example. They are working through the pandemic using their own resources and financial management. As far as I can see they are doing a far better job too, with between fiver per cent and % of the deaths per million of the UK.We need to start to realise a few things: first, that small countries mostly do far better than large countries on very many social and economic measures second, that when land, sea and air assets are allocated properly, Scotland is better resourced pro rata than rUK and last, that we donrsquot actually have a benevolent neighbour since the resources we are ldquobeing given by the UK were ours in the first place.John C Hutchison, Fort William.Read more: Letters: Tory MPs should beware"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-andrew-mckie-esteem-key-workers-not-just-matter-income","story":"But while it lasted, it was a nice gesture, by which the nation could express its gratitude for those in essential roles and recognise the value of their contribution. Naturally, quite a few people then asked the obvious question: why,we value these workers so much, donrsquot we pay them more money, rather than just applauding them  This is a sentiment echoed by a new paper from the Jimmy Reid Foundation, which argues that the coronavirus has exposed failings in the economy.Professor Gregor Gall from the foundation declared that the pandemic has revealed that ldquoour economy and society are far too much based on money and markets, which makes them ldquofragile and ldquolacking in fairness. The proposals include paying public sector workersmore, a Universal Basic Income, increased spending on public transport, a ldquomore just tax system, making universities co-operatives ndash in short, familiar socialist priorities.This is a popular sentiment. Eighty other organisations, mostly on the Left, described the recovery from the coronavirus as ldquoa rare chance to markedly accelerate the repurposing of government away from economic growth and towards goals of wellbeing and sustainability, ending inequality and environmental destruction.Itrsquos interesting that their, and Prof Gallrsquos, solution to a society based too much on money and growth is to spend money ndash other peoplersquos money, presumably extracted from private firms and rich iniduals. Fair enough. Thatrsquos socialism, after all, and the only objection to it is that it has failed and made people poorer, less free and more miserable every single time it has been tried. What interests me more is that those who think in those terms criticise advocates of the market as being interested only in the bottom line, knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing, and so on, yet their prescriptions are drawn from a view of the world which sees things primarily in economic terms, and as a clash of class interests that must be regulated by the state. Again, not very surprising,you start with a book called Capital. This world view does exactly what Marx accused capitalism of doing: reducing people to objects.Yet thatrsquos the wrong way round. A free market demonstrates that just making money is not most peoplersquos main objective. Indeed, it is when societies are based on markets and growth ndash a group into which billions of people have moved over the past four or five decades ndash that iniduals have the freedom to enjoy leisure, provide welfare, and choose occupations and lestyles that they find personally fulfilling.Most of us will agree that people who work in the care sector do an extremely valuable and demanding job that is not well paid. Itrsquos also not very controversial to think of lots of jobs ndash directors of quangos, university vice-chancellors, television presenters, middle-managershellip take your pick ndash where far too much is being paid for something that lots of people could easily do. But many people ndash especially those in the health sector, or in teaching, or in charitable or certain types of political work ndash go into those fields because they find them rewarding in ways that have nothing to do with money.To be, for example, a research associate at the University of Glasgowrsquos School of Social and Political Sciences demands much more in the way of qualications, and has a higher status attached to it, than being an electrician. But an electrician may very well be better paid. That doesnrsquot make Prof Gall an idiot for not choosing to become an electrician, nor does it suggest that we should tax electricians more in order to bump up the salaries of university lecturers.Many people certainly do jobs that they donrsquot enjoy or ndash as farmers having trouble finding UK natives prepared to work on the harvest are discovering ndash wonrsquot do some work because itrsquos too demanding or unpleasant. But the market solution is either to find people from where who are prepared to or, where thatrsquos impossible, pay more in order to attract such workers.Some people do jobs they find dull because they pay well. Others work in poorly paid jobs that they enjoy, or that fit in around their family le . Most probably feel that they deserve more pay for the work they put in, unless theyrsquore stinking rich, in which case they tend to express the view that theyrsquore worth every penny.But, at least in the private sector, the monetary value of a job is a balance between how many people are capable of doing it, and willing to, and its cost to the business. That doesnrsquot mean that the value of a supermarket shelf-stacker, say, is solely measured in money ndash and we should all have realised how important it is to the rest of us. It is, however , not especially dficult to find people who can do it, and certainly easier than finding someone who can run the whole of Tesco and keep it in profit, so itrsquos not at all surprising that there should be a disparity in the wages.It would be nicethis crisis makes us appreciate some of the workers, often not well paid, upon whom we depend. But to think that esteem is a matter of income alone is to be more reductively materialistic than the most ardent capitalist.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The four-day week is another, feted by some as the answer to capitalisms ills and rejected by others as a pie in the sky dream thats anti-productivity.Jacinda Ardern is enjoying the sort of popularity ratings the likes of which other politicians might only dream, and so anything she blinks at becomes headline news.Earlier this month she was asked about whether a four-day week might become the new norm as an outcome of responses to the Covid- crisis. Her reply was carefully measured and lukewarm at best, but it generated headlines breathily suggesting that the New Zealand prime minister was considering the idea.What she said was, in fact: \"I hear lots of people suggesting we should have a four-day work week. Ultimately that really sits between employers and employees.\"Similar occurred here when Nicola Sturgeon was asked about the possibility of a sht in our idea of what a working week should entail.Its an idea thats floated periodically and dismissed but moving out of lockdown and rebuilding the economy will take agility, flexibility and the consideration of a suite of policy ideas. A four day working week as a new standard should be one of those.Not everyone would be for it, of course, from an employer or employee perspective. One Glasgow nightclub owner, asked his view on the idea last week, said it was vital to get the economy up and running before introducing the \"fancul notion\" of a four-day week.Stuart Patrick, chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, is similarly in need of persuasion. \"There is some limited case study evidence that a shorter working week can boost productivity, however customers are not always so enthusiasticit involves disruption to their service.\"A four day week shouldnt lead to disruption of service, however. One of the mistakes when talking about a four day week is the assumption that Thursday would be the new Friday and office hours would be compressed from Monday to Thursday.Negativity about the idea includes the notion that a four-day week would become the preserve of the elite as only white collar workers would benefit. That argument seems to ignore that fact that many people currently work weekends - that doesnt mean they work seven days a week, that means they take their days off on week days.Moving to a three day weekend of Friday to Sunday wouldnt work for everyone and so would be entirely anti the core ethos of the suggested reduction in working hours, which is to improve work le balance.The hospitality industry has been hostile to the idea, saying that its economy will take long hours to get back up and running. But surely people having more leisure time will lead to an increase in spending in restaurants and coffee shops, it will boost internal tourism and,people do gravitate towards a three-day weekend, the nightclub scene could benefit from more people able to stay out on a Thursday night and sleep long on Friday.Britons are no shirkers when it comes to putting in the hours. We work on average  hours each per year, four full weeks more than in Germany, and some of the longest in Europe. Yet we are less productive. Germans produce a GDP of . per hour worked compared to our ..Case studies repeatedly show that when hours are reduced, productivity rises. Working a four day week does not mean working less, it means working more efficiently in the time you have - less cyberloafing and greater output.Cutting hours is also beneficial to the environment. When additional days off are spread across a business it means  per cent fewer people travelling to work, creating fewer emissions and lessening the impact of rush hour traffic. It also, for offices, means the use of less electricity, another huge carbon generator.Employees who work fewer hours report an increased sense of wellbeing, better fitness, improved relationships with friends, partners and children. Its good for business and good for people.But a reduction in the working week might not only mean fewer days, but fewer hours spread over more days. It might suit some people to do a six hour day so they might drop of or pick up children.This is particularly vital as parents are being expected to participate in blended learning for an unspecied time period until the virus has subsided enough that schools might resume full time hours.The modern working day was built to suit the body clock and circumstances of middle aged men. Its outdated and inefficient it doesnt work well for women or for current lestyles.Weve shown that workplaces and employees can adapt rapidly to change. There is no better time than now to reshape the world of work to suit employees.Proper consideration of a working norm that respects every element of an employees le is vital and a four-day week is an excellent place to start.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

They have done it for much less in the past.While the Political Declaration as part of the Brexit deal points to both sides using their ldquobest endeavours to get an agreement on fishing rights by July , securing a deal by that date is not a legal requirement.Mr Deas stressed fishing rights should be separate from the wider trade talks but there was a political reason for Brussels to link them.:Nicola Sturgeon: Covid- resources will be erted to no-deal Brexit plansno talks extensionNoting how the EU fleet fished six times as much in UK waters as British vessels did in EU waters, he explained: ldquoThere is a big dferential there that gives the UK quite a lot of leverage. On the EU side, the leverage is the threat to withhold a trade agreement unless the UK concedes on fisheries. This is something of a nuclear option.He acknowledged there was currently a wide gap between the two sides in the trade talks but that he expected to see a deal done sometime in the autumn.The fishermenrsquos leader noted that because the industry was ldquosold out by the Government in the s, there now seemed to be a close alignment between both sides in the approach to the talks with the EU.Mr Deas suggested the ldquolanding ground for a deal on fishing rights would be agreeing to maintain access for the EU fleet in UK waters infor a new sharing arrangement.Ms Macdonald noted how the fishing community had been impacted by the coronavirus outbreak but this would begin to ease as the hospitality sector ed.ldquoBut thinking that that should be a reason for an extension in relation to fishing is not helpful, she declared.ldquoA further extension just creates more uncertainty. The industry has already had four years of uncertainty since the referendumhellipIn relation to fishing, we feel strongly there are no reasons why we cannot leave the CFP by the end of this year and be going into these [quota]negotiations at the end of this year for the fishing opportunities in  as an independent coastal state."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-huge-line-cars-queue-mcdonalds-glasgow","story":"People were already queuingup am this morning as several of the fast-food chains drive-thru branches acrossScotlandbegan offering takeaways.At Pollokshaws Road in Glasgow dozens of cars were seen queuing up for their first McDonalds since the chain shut at the beginning of lockdown.: Police step in to control traffic jams outside reopened McDonalds after coronavirus lockdown rule relaxationMcDonaldsis currently operating with a limited menu due to having less staff in kitchen areas at one time.This still includes fan favourites such as Big Macs and McNuggets - but sadly there are no breakfast options.Again, this is down to fewer staff and also restaurants operating under reduced hours of am until pm.McDonalds has also introduced aspending limit of pound on Uber Eatsand at drive-thrus to try and control the high number of orders."},{"url":null,"title":"msp-calls-curbs-puppy-farms-scotland","story":"Christine Grahamersquos Welfare of DogsBill has been formally introduced at Holyrood after a consultation phase which started in .It would bring more breeders into the licensing regime and introduce a registration process for unlicensed litters, meaning prospective dog owners must take a responsible approach.Puppies which are bred in an irresponsible way often end up with serious health problems later in le.The SNP MSPrsquos proposed legislation is backed by groups including the SSPCA, OneKind and Dogs Trust.Ms Grahame, who is also convener of Holyroodrsquos cross-party animal welfare group, said: ldquoAnimal welfare is a cause close to my heart and I have pursued this Bill as a remedy to the horric conditions we see in puppy farms and with unscrupulous breeders.ldquoI know first-hand how much a dog can add to someonersquos le and a whole familyrsquos experience but it is important that people understand the commitment theyrsquore taking on and that they act responsibly when buying an animal ndash a puppy or dog is a sentient being, not a fashion accessory, not an impulse buy.She continued: ldquoThat wide-eyed puppy may be appealing, but how do you know what its upbringing was, have you seen it with its mother ldquoDespite many good breeders and advertising campaigns too many dogs are still given up or bred with horric health issues that lead to heartache for all concerned.ldquoIf my Bill becomes law then every litter of puppies born in Scotland will be traceable either through the licensing or the registration scheme.ldquoProspective dog owners will be required to consider a series of questions before acquiring a puppy or dog.

The MPs who genuinely cannot come in, our democratic rights are being snipped away and were being turned into parliamentary eunuchs.\"Not only will the hundreds of MPs, who for one reason or another will not be able to come in because they are affected by Covid, be denied their fundamental rights, but their constituents will not have a voice in Parliament because they will not be able to vote.\":Nicola Sturgeon: Covid- resources will be erted to no-deal Brexit plansno talks extensionPhilippa Whitford, the SNPrsquos health spokeswoman at Westminster, was also unable to attend because she is believed to be in a high-risk group.\"The Tory Government is attacking democracy by shutting down virtual participation in the UK Parliament. Many people across Scotland and the UK will be disenfranchised by the move, which will block their MPs from participating and voting, argued the Central Ayrshire MP.She said it was particularly unjust that those MPs, who would be most disenfranchised by the removal of the hybrid Parliament, had been excluded from voting on the Commons motion.ldquoMany MPs from Scotland and where, through no choice of their own, will find themselves locked out of Parliamentthey or a family member are shielding or in a high-risk group. Over time, other MPs will be affected by quarantine and self-isolation requirements as the pandemic continues. SNP MPs will continue to press the Tory Government to reverse its botched plans and reinstate full virtual participation, added Dr Whitford.Ahead of the vote, Rebecca Hilsenrath, the Commissionrsquos Chief Executive, called on MPs \"to show leadership in championing equality and non-discrimination\" when voting on the Government plans to ensure Parliament \"remains inclusive\".She said: \"We are concerned by the announcement today from the Leader of the House of Commons which implies that Parliament may proceed without provision for the remote participation of Members who are unable to travel to Westminster because of the pandemic.\"This will place at signicant disadvantage MPs who are shielding or self-isolating because of age, disability, health conditions or pregnancy, as well as other Members who will struggle to attend the chamber in person due to travel restrictions and caring responsibilities.\"It cannot be right for Parliament to proceed without provision for remote participation, when many elected representatives cannot attend in person.\"In a joint statement, Mr Halfon and Labourrsquos Vicky Foxcroft, the Shadow Minister for Disabled People, urged the Government to re-think plans to end digital voting.\"What stronger message can you get than the EHRC, one of the Governments own non-departmental public bodies, confirming that the ending of remote participation for those of us who are shielding or otherwise unable to attend Parliament is discriminatory \" they asked.Mr Rees-Mogg told his ConservativeHome podcast that he was planning to introduce measures to allow shielding MPs a way to play a limited role in Commons proceedings.He said the changes were necessary because legislation was on a \"go slow\" due to constraints on committees operating with only around a third of the usual level of legislative activity.\"We would simply not have been able to deliver on the manestowe had not brought Parliament back,\" declared the Commons Leader.He told the Commons that he would table a motion on Wednesday, which would enable those MPs unable to attend Parliament on medical grounds to take part in certain proceedings.Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, was forced to draw up plans to allow MPs to safely vote on the proposals in person on Tuesday but he has called on the Government and Labour to agree on a safe compromise."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11436076.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgow-graced-strawberry-moon-can-see","story":"The Strawberry Moon coincideswith summer solstice once every  years when the moon is situated on the opposite side of the Earth as the Sun - whichfully illuminates its round shape.Unfortunately, despite its fruity name, the moon may notappear in warm colours as we would expect.The lunar event got its name fromNative American tribes, who used the moon to help them indicate when fruit would be ripened.:British fishermen should be able to double their catch in UK waters under new EU dealAs described by NASA: ldquoThe Maine Farmers Almanac first published Indian names for the full moons in the s.

However, we are asking you, for now, to please stay within, or close to, your own local area. And don’t use public transport unless it is absolutely necessary.”The first steps out of lockdown could only involve “careful and cautious” changes, she said.In Orkney, this means that travel on public bus and inter-island ferry and air services will continue to be for essential reasons only during Phase One, with passenger numbers severely restricted as a result of and in line with social distancing requirements.Across Scotland it is assessed that social distancing will reduce transport capacity by  per cent –  per cent and this figure is very much in line with the assessment in Orkney for our ferries and local bus services.During Phase One, there will be no changes to the current timetables for local bus, ferry and inter-island air services.For Orkney Ferries, the aim is to help protect residents in the isles from the risk of infection – along with the crews who operate the service – and to ensure that the ferries can continue to run and deliver freight and other essential supplies.The Scottish Government’s new guidance, published on Tuesday , will help public transport operators and passengers prepare for the further lting of lockdown restrictions at a future date.Detailed information from the government on the newly announced Public Transport Guidance has been sent to the council. Careful consideration is being given to how this might apply locally when the move to Phase Two begins.The guidance does state that people should wear face coverings when using public transport and further information on the council’s expectations on this will be provided in due course.The government has acknowledged that there will be geographic challenges in implementing the guidance and that there can be no ‘one size fits all’ to the approach taken across Scotland.The government’s latest travel advice is available here: https:www.transport.gov.scot coronavirus-covid- transport-transition-plan advice-on-how-to-travel-safely copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If a planning application is subsequently submitted, neighbour notication and publicity will be undertaken, and iniduals and communities will have an opportunity to make representations on that application to the planning authority at that time.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Orcadian has made continued appeals to for the figures to be made public, along with other key figures relating to the outbreak in Orkney, and members of the wider community have called for transparency when it comes to way the crisis is being managed in the county.As it stands, Orkney has recorded eight test-positive cases of coronavirus, but no figure is available for the number of tests which have actually been conducted within the county.Now, it appears that regular updates on the number of folk being tested in each health board area in Scotland will soon be made available.Responding to a question put forward by Mr McArthur on the matter at today#s Topical Questions at Holyrood, health secretary Jeane Freeman indicated that information on tests conducted through NHS controlled facilities will be available shortly, subject to quality assurance. She explained: “We’re working to make sure that we give as clear and as robust data as we can possibly can and, as soon as we’re ready to publish that, and with what frequency we will update it, I’ll make sure Mr McArthur knows that.”Responding to this confirmation from Ms Freeman, the Orkney MSP said: “With test and protect already up and running and some restrictions now being eased, it is even more critical that the public are equipped with accurate, reliable and timely information so that they can make informed decisions going forward. “The number of confirmed COVID cases and COVID-related deaths are already published daily, but the public are still being left in the dark about the level of testing taking place.  Without these figures, it is impossible for anyone to make sense of what is happening on the ground.  “Being open and transparent about testing numbers is crucial to building public trust and confidence which, ultimately, is a key component in keeping our communities safe as we begin to ease restrictions over time.  “The First Minister not only agreed with me this point but also gave an assurance that ministers would now consider how to make this data available. “The Health Secretary has now provided her own assurance that the information will be available shortly. This needs to happen now, however, as the continued delays are doing nothing to help build public confidence at a time when people are desperately looking for clarity.” copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters.

Such inquiry requires social science, some sociological imagination and a grain of empathy.Much easier to blame those poor plebs who haven#t got a grip.No need to invest on ending intergenerational deprivation and increasing opportunity too.Playgrounds for schools in poorer parts of our cities Why bother.Simples Peter, integrate #Care# for young and old into the NHS. That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Ian#s suggestion does nothing to end intergenerational deprivation, aka poverty. Poverty, and other social ills, can result in obesity in ious ways.Obesity simply is not automatically a #lestyle choice#.To suggest so is to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming.Not all single parents on benefits, depending also on whatever the Foodbank might provide, can easily promote healthy lestyles for all of their children.Many are struggling with issues beyond Ian#s limited appreciation.Seven year olds don#t generally make lestyle choices. Fat cells, once over produced in response to whatever unwelcome stimulus, don#t simply disappear. They hang around calling to be filled.Not all parents have time or money to afford Shetland Recreational Trust#s offerings.They dont all have the ability to get their children to the leisure facilities.It is only #simples#you take an uncaring and simplistic approach. Ian knows this intellectually as it has been pointed out more than once. Yet he persists. Odd. A little more fellow feeling might stem his approach.All I am suggesting Peter is an attempt to control excessive eating of Junk foodswith integrating our NHH with free access to all to a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Just how can that be #to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming. #Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  If Ian imagines free education and access to the NHS has equalled le chances this is going to be a walk in the park.If Ian imagines the Welfare State to be thriving why so many Foodbanks  On another planet does not just describe Boris and Dodgy Dom today.There are also undernourished children in Shetland and across the UK, and parents going without in order that their children can eat. Ian might be interested to research the number of food banks before the era of Conservstive austerity and see how well the number has grown since. Quite an achievement for his #thriving welfare state#. Soon unemployment numbers will be thriving too thanks to the ghastly response to Covid  fromBoris and chumsThirty thousand deaths a year is a pre-covid figure we now have obesity as a % factor in covid  deaths!!If we were talking drug deaths running a food bank would be an offence. Perhaps that is a little tongue-in-cheek but this year obesity will be a factor in about , people dying prematurely. Surely about time for gyms, fitness and participant sports organisationsto be granted by integrated into the NHS with a free or subsidised entry for all.Sorry Peter, Boris and his chums were working with Nicola and her chums on Covid  . All in harmony which must be a first!Covid  was away with the fairies, another socialist ideal.!It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head. The statistics are not clearly put and blaming one UK politician, BoJo or Sturgeon is wrong. The SNP and Torie parties pretty much followed identical policies until last week.If Ian imagines free education has eliminated inequalities of opportunity he is mistaken.inequalities of opportunity frequently come down to ambition. The opportunities are there for all, not everybody wishes to take them.Sure good sound parentage and background help promote ambition, but the old adage you can take a horse to water but!!! If you wish to destroy ambition, try extreme socialism. The good old USSR and present-day Venezuela give good examples.I don#t know where to start with this statement Ian, and I#m not sure it will make any dference to youI do.There are multiple stories on just this very subject, but since you are not a big fan of the arts, you might not have read them, seen them or heard them.You can have ambition, and even a great education, but still be knocked back by the old boy network, or because you are not white or not male. These inequalities still exist.There are statistics to show that Eton boys get the top jobs still, and the only way to get a better leader for this country will be to do away with privilege and try to level the playing field. New Zealand for example have a great leader and it is refreshing to see someone lead who has her role on merit.I know nothing of the countries you mention but I am sure they still have ambitious and educated people despite your partisan viewpoint.Well it’s a surprise to see that the Scottish government aren’t being blamed for poverty and suffering this time # turns out it was the underprivileged’s own fault all along. I’m sure a sharp word will snap them out of it and everyone will be a CEO or a government advisor in no time. Just need to put the effort in old boy what what! I’d always thought the morally bereft who profit from misery and desperation who have a lot to do with keeping the poor poor have a lot to answer for though you know payday lenders, gambling companies, private dentists with a monopoly#Ian might as well say the poor are frequently to blame for their lot. Oil rich Norway does not tolerate UK levels of inequality.Neither do many other poprer countries.Quite what the USSR and Venesuala have got to do with it is likely apparent to Ian.Others will see their inclusion within what passes for his argument as a clear attempt at distraction. The possible impacts of being brought up in poverty by others who have had the same dficulties are many.The opportunities for such children are not easily compared to, say, those enjoyed by the young Boris Johnson.Ian is again indulging himself in victim blaming.UK policy has not set out to create level playing fields for socio-econmic participation. It should, but won#t for as long as #One Nation# English Conservatives like Boris Johnson continue to serve the interests of those of Ian Tinkler#s outlook over those of all. On th of May Ian described intergenerational deprivation as #relevant to Victorian times#.NY pretending ambition alone can help all children born into poverty to escape it Ian is demonstrating Victorian attitudes of his own. Seven year olds brought up in bedsits should choose better parental lestyles.I was unaware Thatcher, Blair, Cummings, Callahan, Wilson et all went to Eton. Mind you, Tony Ben, Sir Antony no less went to Westminster college!!!! Quite what that has to do #With the price of tea in China # rather like your former comments, escapes me!The one with us, young Dominic, no Eton education, the poor wa. Privately educated, Oxford University. Married to Mary Wakefield, daughter of Sir Humphry, raised at Chillingham Castle, Northumberland. Descended from a former colonial governor of Kenya. Good point Ian # definitely not part of the old boy#s network # Cummings never went to Eton and only went to his father#s small estate in the North rather than his we#s family castle. Oh the deprivation they suffered! Glad to see social mobility bringing such paupers to the upper echelons of society.Johan, Ian#s not just a contrarian, compelled to rile others, but does so to share his quite unpleasant world-view. He talks of intergenerational deprivation as being a #very trendy left-wing academic hypothesis, relevant to Victorian times# but it#s a known fact that many a bairn raised in poverty, enjoying few opportinities will go on to live in poverty and have few opportunities. If they become parents, the likelihood of their bairns being able to do better lessens generation by generation without purposeful government action designed to level the playing field.The concept used here is social mobility and many governments globally take pains to increase it. Where those with disadvantageous starts in le go on, on average, to do better than their parents,social mobility is high. Where their lot is likely to be fixed at birth social mobility is low. Scotland has a long running research project to monitor it. In addition to the factors you cite, cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence as well as other non-lestyle factors. Ian knows obesity can have complex causes, but doesn#t care. Its quite tragic.Poor parenting is really not a class thing whatever are trendy humanist academics may say. Just feeble attempts to justy socialist ideals. However, that has nothing to do with my attempt to deal with excess fat and obesity., #cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug-dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence. # Well apart from the semi-literate bit that sounds a little bit like an Etonian upbringing, so typical of the Aristocracy!!! I love the bit about #Scotland has a long-running research project to monitor it.# .What a shame it is run by a load of left-wing academics, perhaps that is why Scotland#s performance falls so far short of England#s with regard to social mobility!! As for the complex causes of obesity, it is really simple Peter, it is not even class-related. It is simply eating more than food than your body needs. Whatever socio-psychological hogwash you may spout, in the final analysis, comes down to eating too much. It is that simple.“cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug-dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence. ” Well apart from the semi-literate bit that sounds a little bit like an Etonian upbringing, so typical of the Aristocracy!!#Yes Ian. The upper classes do suffer the same le limiting factors as the poor. My dear old Uncle Bertie was once forced to sell the family silver to pay for his cr**k habit. He had to dine using stainless steel for some months until the rent from his farms allowed him to buy a new set. Oh the humanity!If only everyone could be as middle class as us we would all be in a much better situation.So for you, the uneven distribution is simply bad parenting choices. This is of course #socio-psychological hogwash# of your own.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

Just like traditional schooling.The talk and plan is that schools will reopen physically after summer, possibly and probably in a very dferent manner.It seems however, that there is a rush to adapt an old norm to a new unknown reality.This is understandable, as change is always uncertain, and it is safe to stick with what you know, but perhaps we will be missing an opportunity to create a new reality.Begin afresh with a blank piece of paper.If our best creative thinkers were asked to make a framework for educating young people, starting with that blank sheet of paper, with today’s technologies would they build the institutions we have today Would they build a school Perhaps it would be unfair on the classes of  or  and further, to experiment with them and their futures, so undoubtedly things will be kept as normal as possible. But with curriculum change and continual development flux is nothing unusual.There have been plenty experiments in the past.It is already quite radical to have suggested staggered start times, blended learning and a concentration on screen contact.Perhaps national exam level provision could develop into a drop-in style of tutorial seminar-based provision, where a school is a resource to be used as required, and not attended per se.Perhaps the new normal could have place-centred outdoor learning as its core.I heard one teacher complain on the radio, “we are educationalists, not child minders”.There seems to be a blurring between parenting, social work and education, and schools appear to be being used as a solution to all societies’ ills, becoming all things to all people.The role that schools have played over and above teaching has become evident during Covid and lockdown as parents have had to look after their children continuously.Situations are all unique, and there will have been a whole spectrum from embraced appropriate enjoyable home learning, to dysal chaos.Most families have probably been somewhere in the middle, but sadly in some cases schools have had to continue providing a haven for vulnerable children.Most importantly there is “NoWrongPath” even more so today when destinations may be more uncertain.Resilience, empathy, creativity and integrity will be what our children need in the future.I think the class of  will be fine, they have had a unique experience which will help make them who they will become.Travel is likely to be harder in the near future, how easy it would be to take a family around the world or ride a motorbike a long distance for a gap year is debatable, but there will always be opportunity for experiential adventure.Routes back into traditional education are always available, perhaps even more so now.I suspect universities will be desperate for students, and will be creating access courses to enable those with uncertain schooling certicates.When I was caught ‘skiving’ PEI had no idea I would end up running an outdoor activity centre.When I was failing physics A Level at school, I had no idea I would end up with a Masters degree from Edinburgh University.While the First Law of Thermodynamicsis a crucial and fabulous bit of knowledge, it probably isn’t what helped me when my motorbike gearbox broke in Jericho.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Clear-Your-Head-5-1.jpg","title":"scottish government make time to clear your","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe coronavirus pandemic has changed le for everyone in Scotland and had a real impact on how many of us are feeling.Some people will have felt low whilst coping with the necessary restrictions, maybe struggling with their emotions for the first time and finding themselves angry or upset for no reason.As the nation moves into the first phase of easing lockdown restrictions, the coming weeks may bring a mixture of dferent feelings and emotions as people start to think about going outside again – but there are things that can be done to make it easier, with help and support available.Supported by SAMH, Breathing Space and the Samaritans, the campaign website – clearyourhead.scot # also provides sources of help for those who need to talk to someone about how they’re feeling.Whether it’s dealing with the pressure of juggling childcare with work commitments, facing continued isolation at home, or feeling anxious about ing to work, there are things you can do every day that will help you through it.Keeping to a routine as much as possible, by sleeping and waking at the same time and eating at regular times can give your day structure and help you feel more in control.Now we’re able to go outside more than once a day, making time to go for a walk, jog and cycle can help boost self-esteem, energy levels, and importantly help us sleep better.Staying connected has never been more important, particularlyyou’ve had a bad day or are feeling stressed.

The announcement by management is therefore profoundly regrettable.“Management plans to make redundant  employees and to bring forward a phased-process of reducing agency staffing affecting up to  workers. Every job lost is a heavy blow for the inidual concerned, their household, the wider community and economy – especially in the face of the current Covid- pandemic.“Ahead of this announcement being made, I spoke to senior management to call on them to utilise the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme to protect jobs and retain skilled workers the prospect of workers being thrown onto the dole queues at this time is unacceptable.“Management confirmed they will be proceeding to a -day consultative period on their proposals but that they will consider furlough as an option. They sought to reassure us of their ambitions for Wrightbus in Ballymena and its centrality to their plans.“Instead of reducing employment, we need to ramp up production of hydrogen-buses to curb greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a more environmentally-sustainable economy. “The Wrightbus workforce is perfectly positioned to make a vital contribution to that they have the skills to build the buses at the heart of any future green transport policy.“The request for furlough will be top of Unite’s agenda in the consultation process. Having played a lead role in securing the transfer of Wrightbus, which faced liquidation, to the Bamford group we are determined to bring as many jobs as possible to Ballymena as a result”, Mr Brash concluded.

Having grown up in the era when the river was dominated by the huge red brick edice of the Braidwater Mill, Rodney points out that its path is more exposed to public view than ever. “When you look back, it was pretty much enclosed space from McNinch Footbridge to Harryville Bridge.  “People had no reason to be in that area unless they were mill workers.“Nowadays we have great views right along this section and I personally feel that there has to be a joined up approach to making full use of this fantastic potential.“With the opening of the retail park it has now opened the area up to everyone and the nature and beauty around the river with wildle such as swans, ducks, otters, kingfishers and other wildle regularly seen on the stretch from Sainsbury’s down to Harryville bridge,” he said. But he acknowledges that not not everyone will see the beauty associated with the area. “There will always be some who will still treat it as a dumping ground and continue to put the wildle and the environment at risk by dumping their refuse into the river. “These people need to be told in no uncertain terms that this will not be lolerated by the local community - we have the ability to impose fines on those who continually flaunt regulations and I would call for such monetary penalties to be used more frequently.”But Rodney beleives the real driving force behind the naural rejuvenation of the area must comes as a united push.“ I feel that the authorities responsible for this area and the retail park owner have to take seriously the issues associated with this stretch of water and listen to the concerns of the community groups and members of the public who regularly use the pathways around the river for daily exercise.“My opinion is that things weren’t thought through properly at the outset and the environmental issues weren’t taken into account when the retail park was being planned. “The aim now should be to preserve the beauty of this stretch of the river Braid and that means taking steps to make sure this happens.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3138061.jpg--.jpg?1590480464000\n","title":"opinion moral necessity to support local business in post virus world","story":"By the Very Rev Dr Norman Hamilton OBEThese last weeks have seen contrasting trends as we battle with coronavirus. On the one hand we have come together in our communityto clap for carers on a Thursday evening, and to make ‘scrubs’ for those in the front line of care in the NHS and in care homes. But with most of our local shops, family businesses and services closed, we have also looked to multinational companies and the big supermarket chains to provide us with what we need . They have done much for which we must be genuinely grateful – perhaps best shown in the huge effort to deliver groceries to homes where people are vulnerable. And many companies have prospered. For example in mid April, Jeff Bezos who is the founder and boss of Amazon, saw his personal wealth swell by pound billionafter soaring demand for online shopping sent the firms share price to a new high. This cemented his position as the worlds richest man with a fortune of well over pound billion. As they say – it is an ill wind that blows no one any good. PATTERNSThese changed patterns of le – evident community spirit and massively increased internet shopping – will bring big moral dilemmas when the pandemic is under control and some degree of normality s. Will community spirit be relegated to the back benches by the need for so many of us to rebuild the patterns of our own everyday lives  And crucially, will we have become so content with buying on-line and having the parcel delivered to our front door, that we will be less committed to buying locally, and supporting local business  I must confess to having real fears on both questions. When the focus moves away from carers and the NHS, what community need will fill the gap  It is very dficult to think of an example which affects every one of us, and to which we can bring such loyalty. And will the obvious convenience of having that parcel delivered to our front door be set aside to go shopping locally on a cold November morning or a wet February afternoon Personally I feel that it is a moral necessity to support our local businesses and shops as best we can – evenit costs a little more to do so. They of course will be well aware of the threat from the big international companies, and must play their part in quality of service and show the ‘personal touch’ that will make it attractive to do business with them in its own right. And there would be a great added bonus that such support on an ongoing basis would be a quite new and important expression of community spirit.I have absolutely no dficulty with the owner of Amazon seeing new opportunities to expand his business. But I have real dficultyordinary citizens like myself in our local area see it as acceptable to give his company so much of our limited income that many of the businesses in our neighbourhood go into serious decline. The Biblical command to ‘love your neighbour as yourself’ has a new and crucially important relevance.

More shops at its retail park section will be open next week, such as Argos and Currys.However, in the short term only outlets with direct street access or direct access within a retail park are allowed to open - which rules out many non-essential outlets in shopping centres such as fashion retailers.Rushmere says it already has well-established social distancing practices, with one-way systems, live footfall cameras, floor stickers to mark two-metre gaps and heightened hygiene measures.It is in a category of shopping centres which have fared relatively well during lockdown because of its essential shops. But for other centres which are dominated by fashion and leisure offerings such as restaurants and coffee shops, it may be a dferent matter.Gone will be the pattern of shopping centre visits in the past - a leisurely dander through Primark or Next, followed by spontaneous visits to other shops, rounded off with a cappuccino and cupcake in a coffee shop.Instead, we are likely to face prolonged queues for the most popular stores - and once inside, there will be one-way systems restricting our way around. And the popularity of stores like Primark could mean that you will have to book a visit in advance.After all that queuing and bulk-buying, you might fancy a coffee and a sit-down - that could mean even more queuing outside the coffee shop, especiallyits capacity is cut from  tables to  in order to maintain social distancing.You might think, I#ll sit down on a mall seat for a rest instead. But as Peter Murray of Newry#s Buttercrane Shopping Centre has said, mall seats have been taken away, which means no lingering.The role of shopping as a family expedition might also change - stores which have to restrict numbers may not want a family group of five taking up space. The only customer who counts is the one with the buying power, rather than the bored kids.Many stores rely on impulse buys to bump up average spend - but there will be less scope for impulse.However, the hassle of queuing may mean that people do more planning ahead, therefore more bulk-buying could take place. There are just a small number of essential retailers open in CastleCourt Shopping Centre in Belfast, such as Halax, Holland  Barrett and Superdrug. It usually has around . million visitors a year. Across the city centre, Victoria Square is closed as it has no #essential# retailers. The big question, too, for both centres is whether office workersto the city centre in large numbers.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThey have been a destination for retail therapy for years - but one observer remarks that there may be more anxiety in shopping centre trips of the future FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThey have been a destination for retail therapy for years - but one observer remarks that there may be more anxiety in shopping centre trips of the futureOur observer says: Locations that have the most essential retailers and are more community centres are the ones that will do better long-term. Yes, footfall may be down % but at least they have maintained shoppers and their shopping habits.The big issue iseveryone stays at home and doesn#t go back to the big urban areas to work shops and shopping centres will all be affected. You might normally have , transient workers and students in a city centre, butthat goes down to ,, that has the biggest impact of all.The physical layout of stores may also be dferent. With fewer people allowed in at a time, retailers might adjust the space for actual shopping, and instead increase their storage space - especially since goods which have been ed will need to be quarantined to make sure they#re virus-free before theyto the shop floor. Changing rooms are already out of bounds.Of course, plenty of us are die-hard shoppers and nothing will put us off spending our money when we#re allowed to do so in brick-and-mortar stores rather than online. It might just take a bit more planning than before.

By Allan PrestonJune   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA shielding Belfast pensioner who cannot leave his home for fear of infection has said he feels ignored over government arrangements for food deliveries.James Hutchinsonlives with a serious lung condition, COPD, which means he and his we June have not crossed their front door in  weeks.He is among over , vulnerable people in Northern Ireland who have been told to stay at home by GPs. Last month, Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey announced a scheme for those who are shielding to register for priority home deliveries from supermarkets.Mr Hutchinson signed up straight away, but says a month later he has heard nothing and is still relying on his daughter Christine to drop off groceries at home.I just haven#t had any contact from anybody and it#s infuriating, he told the Belfast .We#ve been scared to go outside since the lockdown announcement was made. My family are happy to help but we don#t like asking them, because God forbidthey passed something on and had that on their conscience.Mr Hutchinson said his COPD means he is classied as highly vulnerable.My chances of surviving Covid- would be zilch. My we has asthma but isn#t shieldingshe went out, though, and got the virus and brought it home it would be just as bad.There#s been nobody across this door since March. They can sit in the front garden, but we would have to wipe down the garden gate with disinfectant.I would love to go out and have a coffee, but it#s the fear factor that keeps me inside.We both have a car but we can#t use it. My daughter will start the engine up sometimes and throw the keys back into the garden.Boredom#s a big issue for us as well, but we#re thankful for small mercies that we#re still here.He said recent scenes of people breaking lockdown restrictions with house parties and crowding at beaches were infuriating.Teenagers may be care-free once they#ve had a few beers, but they#re fighting with police on the beach in Ballyholme.There should be light at the end of the tunnel as the numbers are dropping. But the risk of a second spike would be because of these clampets that are running about boozing, partying and barbecuing.A spokesperson for the Department for Communities said that they have now contacted Mr Hutchinson directly about his case.Meanwhile, the Stormont Executive have agreed that those who are shielding will be able to go outdoors again by June the R number, used to estimate the spread of the virus, is still below one when ministers meet on Thursday.This will allow those affected to go outside with one member of their household while maintaining social distancing.

As they are self-contained and may require less advance notice before opening, the opening times for these types of accommodation may be advanced to earlier than  July depending on scientic advice July  – guesthouses guest accommodation BBs hotels hostels.

The Minister continued:“Tourist accommodation will operate in a new, and challenging, world when it begins to emerge from Covid-. “We need to enable businesses to plan ahead to ensure social distancing and hygiene practices are in place and staff are trained. These practices will also be essential to reassure customers and employees that establishments are Covid- safe. “Enabling accommodation businesses to generate essential revenue will help to protect iniduals and livelihoods which support families and communities across Northern Ireland.” googletag.cmd.push The Tourism Recovery Steering Group, which the Minister chairs, and its supporting Working Group, will take relevant UK safe working guidance and make it specic to NI as overarching tourism sector guidance.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here is how some companies have been helped, and what is available. Case Study  Phion Therapeutics  IN THE LABORATORY: Professor Helen McCarthy A BELFAST-BASED spin-out company from the School of Pharmacy at Queen’s University in the city, received a pound, Fast Start grant through the UK Government’s Innovate UK programme. Phion Therapeutics Ltd was established in  and employs  staff in the development of drug delivery technology, specialising in viral injections. googletag.cmd.push The Innovate UK grant will be used by the company to develop a drug to combat Covid-, as a part of a six-month project which kicked off on June . Professor Helen McCarthy is the chief executive officer and founder of Phion Therapeutics. She said: “Vaccine therapies are working towards preventing people getting the disease, but for those people that have got the disease and the virus is replicating uncontrollably, we need something to help tip the balance in favour of the patient.” Coronavirus enters cells through a key receptor, ACE-. Phion Therapeutics’ proof of concept study, is designed to seeit can “reduce expression of the ACE- receptor.” googletag.cmd.push Professor McCarthy said it will be six months before the company will know whether it can “knock down” the ACE- receptor and for how long. There will then be  months of pre-clinical development work, followed up by a toxicology study before going into Phase  in patients. Company chief operating officer Darach Neeson said the grant offers the company a great opportunity to get the initial proof of concept data. He said: “This will then allow us to leverage private investment for the further development of the treatments.” ‘We’ll be stronger than ever’ Case Study  iSensing A BELFAST-BASED tech company is preparing to emerge from the coronavirus lockdown stronger than ever, after securing a major UK Government grant through the Fast Start initiative. Established less than two years ago, iSensing was awarded a pound, grant which has allowed it to continue developing its state-of-the analytical products. The iSensing products are used by public bodies to improve transport networks. The company’s global partnership director Harvey Beilinsohn, said being based in the UK has given his company an important advantage. He said: “I am thankful that I am based in the UK because talking to our teammates in the USA, Mexico and Brazil, when it comes to the financial support in the UK they are just lost for words. “They can’t believe you can get this level of support - through the furlough scheme, through the loans or even this kind of grant. “I am very, very thankful to be based in Northern Ireland and for the help from Westminster.” The Covid- emergency has temporarily slowed down iSensing’s business operation but the young company is using the disruption to refine some of its existing technology. Harvey said: “Our business is focussed on transport and we now know transport is not going to be the same. So it was really about us repurposing our products, and to do that it required some money.” The iSensing technology analyses data with a view to helping local authorities identy trends. Harvey said: “As a small company we can do a lot with pound,.  BIG ADVANTAGE: Harvey Beilinsohn Protecting jobs and keeping firms afloat Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers: middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to a pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June. There will be no interest or penalties on any amount deferred.  middot Commercial tenants who cannot pay their rent because of coronavirus will be protected from eviction. middot The UK Government’s Bounce Back Loans Scheme provides loans of up to pound, to small businesses, with a  per cent UK Government-backed guarantee for lenders. middot The Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme is available for loans or finance of up to poundm. The UK Government will provide the lender with an  per cent guarantee to support the lending. middot The Coronavirus Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme will repay employers the current rate of Statutory Sick Pay they pay current or former employees for sickness starting on or after March   middot The Future Fund will issue loans between pound, to pound million to innovative companies which are facing financing dficulties due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt RevAndrew Forster, joined scores of parishioners from the Parish of St Augustine’s and further afield for the service at Bishop Street car park in the city centre on Sunday morning to mark Pentecost Day. The service,which took place in glorious sunshine,was led by the Rector of St Augustines - ‘The Wee Church on the Walls’ -Rev Nigel Cairns. The car park adjoins St Augustine’s Parish Hall and is opposite the city’s courthouse. A team of volunteers, dressed in ‘high-vis’ vests and PPE gear, oversaw a one-way, ‘car ferry’ type system, that meant cars were directed in one entrance and out bya dferent route after the service. googletag.cmd.push Social-distancing guidelines required all those present to remain in their cars during worship, and parish volunteers ensured that none of the worshippers fell victim to the soaring temperature. Bishop Andrew, who preached the sermon,welcomed the congregation to what he called his ‘back garden’ . He said: St Augustine’s was known as ‘the Wee Church on the Walls’. Today, we’re the wee church without walls. I always think about St Augustine’s as the wee Church with a big heart and today we’re showing our big heart because we’re together, worshipping God on this Pentecost Sunday. googletag.cmd.push “This is definitely a first for me,” the Bishop said, “and I would imagine it’s a first for many of you as well, but God is here and we worship him in spirit and in truth.” Rev Cairns echoed Bishop Forster’s welcome to the first ‘Drive-through Church’ in the inner city, and thanked all those who had helped make the service possible. He said the St Augustine’s parishioners would be gathering for worship in the same location again next Sunday.

The Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt RevAndrew Forster, joined scores of parishioners from the Parish of St Augustine’s and further afield for the service at Bishop Street car park in the city centre on Sunday morning to mark Pentecost Day. The service,which took place in glorious sunshine,was led by the Rector of St Augustines - ‘The Wee Church on the Walls’ -Rev Nigel Cairns. The car park adjoins St Augustine’s Parish Hall and is opposite the city’s courthouse. A team of volunteers, dressed in ‘high-vis’ vests and PPE gear, oversaw a one-way, ‘car ferry’ type system, that meant cars were directed in one entrance and out bya dferent route after the service. googletag.cmd.push Social-distancing guidelines required all those present to remain in their cars during worship, and parish volunteers ensured that none of the worshippers fell victim to the soaring temperature. Bishop Andrew, who preached the sermon,welcomed the congregation to what he called his ‘back garden’ . He said: St Augustine’s was known as ‘the Wee Church on the Walls’. Today, we’re the wee church without walls. I always think about St Augustine’s as the wee Church with a big heart and today we’re showing our big heart because we’re together, worshipping God on this Pentecost Sunday. googletag.cmd.push “This is definitely a first for me,” the Bishop said, “and I would imagine it’s a first for many of you as well, but God is here and we worship him in spirit and in truth.” Rev Cairns echoed Bishop Forster’s welcome to the first ‘Drive-through Church’ in the inner city, and thanked all those who had helped make the service possible. He said the St Augustine’s parishioners would be gathering for worship in the same location again next Sunday.

The ‘Day Today’ shop at the corner of Rathlin Gardens is known locally as Harry Doots, harking back to a previous owner of the shop. Now, a special mural has been created at the shop to mark this famous name. Patrick McCloskey, the current owner of the store, said he was delighted with the mural which celebrates the signicance of the shop to local residents over the decades. As well as Harry Doots shop, graffiti hotspots around Bishops Field, Central Drive, Cromore and Rathlin Gardens in Creggan have also been transformed into real works of art over the past week. googletag.cmd.push Karl Porter and Donal O’Doherty of the guerrilla street art group UV Arts teamed up with Creggan Enterprises and Creggan Neighbourhood Partnership , and with young people from the local area, to give the neighbourhood a facelt. CNP’s Tony O’Doherty said the clean-up of the lane behind the Creggan shops on Central Drive was very much appreciated by the local community. “Karl and Donal’s magnicent art-works have really given new le to the place,” he said. “These young artists are really to be commended. If we’re to frank about it, this work was long overdue, but it has transformed this area from a non-descript back lane into an outdoor urban gallery.” googletag.cmd.push The artists also worked with young people to create colourful new entrances for Bishop’s Field Paacuteirc an Easpaig. Conal McFeely of Creggan Enterprises said it was ‘entirely appropriate’ that one of the new murals at the facility would acknowledge and celebrate the potential of our young people. “It is very important that we pay tribute to the immense effort being done by young people - within families, the community and within the frontline services - during this Covid crisis. “There is an old Irish saying – ‘Mol an Oacuteige agus tiocfaidh siacute - Praise young people and they will flourish’, and this concept is now proudly emblazoned at the entrance to Bishop’s Field, thanks to Karl and Donal.” Local resident, Kitty McDaid, speaking on behalf of her neighbours, said: “We are over the moon with all the new artwork and the clean-up of the lane behind our homes, a massive thankyou to all involved.” Not far from Central Drive, at Cromore and Rathlin Gardens work was also carried out to clean up some of the most signicant areas. Using distinct themes, the artwork added a vibrant splash of colour to each area. Jim Brown, Creggan Community Collective, explained the signicance of the new artwork at Cromore. “People are pulling together at this time, the community are giving freely of their time and effort to help others. There is an understanding that what is required is “Solidarity… not Charity. “Creggan people are resilient, and have learned that we cannot simply rely on the state or anyone  to help us, we have the capacity to help ourselves.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They are open from pm to pm, Monday to Friday.ldquoWhile we are open again we are operating under strict guidelines with one-ways systems in place, designated seating areas and a maximum of eight people in the church at any one time, he said.ldquoI had hoped to reintroduce a limited number of sacramentals such as confession and benediction in Kilcoo, as this parish have had very little in the way of services over the last few years due to a shortage of priests. However, diocesan officials have cautioned against it, just now.Fr McKinley, who has been parish priest at Kilmegan for ten years, continued: ldquoThe virus came upon us out to the blue.

Thirty years of the Troubles didnrsquot close us down but I suppose we all just have to put up with it as these are unprecedented times.Despite the first steps being taken to open churches Fr McKinley cautioned it could be quite some time before the parishes could resume their normal schedule.ldquoSt Malachyrsquos in Castlewellan holds over  people. I foresee it wonrsquot be any time soon before we are able to facilitate anything like that number, said Fr McKinley has had to reschedule  weddings and postpone First Communions and confirmations until later in the year.He added: ldquoIt is an eerie and uncomfortable feeling to celebrate Mass in an empty church and I long for the day we will see our churches full to capacity once more.ldquoHowever, while the obligation to attend Sunday Mass has been temporarily lted Masses are still available on the parish webcam for everyone to view.Magheradroll Church of Ireland Church in Ballynahinch will be open for one hour each Thursday, starting next week.Canon Warren Russell, rector, said: ldquoI welcome the reopening of the church in line with the recommendations made by the Northern Ireland Assembly.ldquoWe will open from am to noon on a Thursday which coincides with market day in the town.ldquoWe want to reassure people that all possible safety measures will be in place to facilitate the opening and provide a quiet space for prayer and reflection once again.ldquoThere will be masks, disposable gloves and hand sanitiser available at the back of the church for people to use.Canon Russell, who has been rector for the past  years, added: ldquoWe will measure the response and review it again in a few weeks.

He then raised the alarm with their parents, Valerie and Declan senior, who rushed to be with their son.Paramedics were quickly on to the scene, but on the way to Belfastrsquos Royal Victoria Hospital , the teenager needed a le-saving blood transfusion due to his major internal injuries.The ambulance was met in Greyabbey by a doctor and the emergency helicopter team where the procedure was carried out before Declan continued on to hospital by air.The Year  student from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School, Downpatrick, later underwent eight hours of surgery to save him.Two and a half weeks later, Declan was back at home recovering with his family and vowing to get back on to a tractor as soon as he is fit and able.Eoin, who also attends St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick, wants to give another person a chance of survival.He has started a Just Giving appeal to fund the provincersquos helicopter emergency medical serviceand raise at least the pound, it costs to run it per day. The family has now raised nearly pound,, including gt aid for the service as their thanks for saving Declan.Mrs Keating says her son has a ldquolong road to recovery with rehabilitation and further surgery down the line but they are ldquoforever indebted to the air ambulance and the entire hospital team who cared for Declan. She said surgeons told her that he was ldquoextremely lucky as the accident could have had fatal consequences.Reliving the morning of the accident when Declan mdash whose nickname is lsquoThe Milkmanrsquo mdash and Eoin had just left home to go their unclersquos farm for the milking at am, is still traumatic for Mrs Keating.She said: ldquoI donrsquot like to think about what happened to Declan. For what happened and how it happened, itrsquos nothing short of a miracle for him to be here. We were told thathis injuries had been one centimetre one way or the other, it could have been a lot worst. There were terrible injuries but at least there was no injury to his head or spine head.ldquoIt was just a freak accident and hopefully nothing like this will ever happen again. However, Declan has told me that he will be back in the tractor as soon as he can walk.Mrs Keating said Declan had passed his tractor driving test late last year and was used to driving their tractor to her brotherrsquos nearby dairy farm.ldquoThe boys had set off from home and were literally just yards down the road when the accident happened,ldquo she continued. ldquoWe are not sure how but Declan said that one minute he was driving and the next he was flung out the side door onto the road and the tractor ran over him.ldquoThe tractor continued moving and Eoin managed to get it stopped and immediately checked on Declan and called his daddy.ldquoDeclan was fully conscious and realised he was badly injured. He checkedhis legs and arms worked. He thought that his pelvis was broken and wanted to seehe was paralysed and somehow managed to get himself up and walk over to the other verge before his legs gave way. He was sitting up when me and his father arrived at the scene.Mrs Keating said that while both Declan and Eoin were naturally shocked by what had happened, she was proud of both her sonsrsquo presence of mind during the horric accident.ldquoEoin called us  seconds after the accident and we were there within minutes, she said. ldquoDeclan was alert the whole time when the ambulance and paramedics arrived.Mrs Keating and her husband followed behind the ambulance as Declan was rushed to the RVH. An emergency doctor met the ambulance in Kircubbin before continuing on. However, the parents feared the worst when the ambulance pulled over at the tennis courts in Greyabbey.ldquoThe doctor jumped out of the ambulance and told us not to worry, Declan was OK. He was going to give him a blood transfusion as he was losing blood internally and the air ambulance was on its way. Literally, it seemed the helicopter arrived just seconds later and Declan was transferred by air then to the hospital.Mrs Keating said that the blood transfusion was vital to Declan at that time, adding: ldquoFor remote communities where we live, the air ambulance is an essential service. They only have started carrying blood supplies earlier this year. If he hadnrsquot have gotten the blood, he may not have been here.Declanrsquos injuries were found to be signicant. He sustained a broken pelvis, perforated bladder and bowel, a collapsed lung, three broken ribs, internal bleeding and bruising.Mrs Keating said: ldquoThe accident and emergency doctor said he would have expected anyone  to be in a critical condition with the range of injuries but Declan was in a serious condition which showed us what a fighter he was and he wasnrsquot letting it get the better of him. We took some comfort from this at that time.She said that three teams of specialist surgeons operated on Declan for more than eight hours to deal with his major injuries.ldquoThe surgeons were extremely worried about Declan and I kept askinghe was going to be OK. The surgeon would only say that he was out of immediate danger and that the next - hours would be critical, she said.Declan spent three nights in intensive care before moving into another ward. Mrs Keating said that the care Declan received was ldquofirst-class and spoke of how caring the medics were to their plight.ldquoDeclanrsquos father and I wanted to be with him through the night. At one point the ward sister called us over and offered us the sleep room the surgeons use for rest during their sht. They gave up that room for us for three nights so we could be with Declan and we saw just how busy they all were. We thank them from the bottom of our hearts for their kindness.The family say they were overwhelmed by the support and well wishes they received from their local community and their donations to the appeal.Mrs Keating added: ldquoDeclan will recover and he canrsquot wait to be up again at am every morning to help on the farm as he just loves the farming le. The air ambulance was the legacy of Dr John Hinds [the late emergency medicine specialist] and it would be remiss of me not to remember him and what he did for others during his le and his campaign to get the service.

Even so, there is a palpable sense of joy among the golfing fraternity.St Patrickrsquos Golf Club in Downpatrick resumed last Wednesday and the captain, Robert McCausland, said he ldquowas absolutely delighted.ldquoThe club is very pleased to be up and running again, he remarked.ldquoWe are very grateful to our green keepers who continued with their work during the lockdown and have delivered a golf course in magnicent condition for the members to enjoy.Mr McCausland said the club was now open to new members and that there were a ldquonumber of very attractive offers in place for those who may wish to take up the game of golf.He added: ldquoThe time sheets over the last few days are quite full and the car park has been busy with lots of smiling, happy faces about the club.Wednesday also saw the reopening of Ardglass Club and Paul Vaughan, the clubrsquos director of golf, said the course has been full up ever since.ldquoOur members have been playing in three-balls and going off every  minutes. We havenrsquot had a spare space since we re-opened, he said.ldquoEveryone is delighted to be back and itrsquos great to see so many people about. I think our members were glad to get out of the house and back on to the golf course.ldquoWe have a marshal at the front gate and the members are obeying the all the guidelines so that they can play casual golf.Mr Vaughan said the loss of visitors represented the loss of a major source of income for the club, but hoped this would be offset by new members.ldquoWe have had a lot of enquiries about new members, but visitorsrsquo green fees are a huge part of our business, he said.ldquoHopefully, we will be able to salvage something towards the end of the season and things willto something near normal next year.At Spa Golf Club, near Ballynahinch, which re-opened on Friday, the captain, Gordon Martin said everyone was ldquoexcited at the expectation of getting back playing in a sport we love so much.He went on: ldquoI am very aware of the sacrices many people have made in our communities that allows us to get to this point. May I on behalf of Spa Golf Club members and their families thank all the heros in out communities.ldquoSpa recognises the great responsibility golf has in being one of the first sports to re-open after the lockdown and fully intends to adhere to all the protocols agreed by our governing body.He said the club had been fortunate to be able to keep some greens staff working at the club over the lockdown period.ldquoThe driest April on record put extra burdens on green keeping staff in terms of additional watering and essential maintenance. But we are pleased to say the course is looking just magnicent.Mr Martin also said it has been a dficult period from a financial point of view with not many golf clubs being eligible for any signicant assistance under the ious Covid finance packages.Bright Castle Golf Club, which is privately owned by the Ennis family, has also been busy since it re-opened last Thursday.ldquoThe course is looking magnicent and the members are enjoying it, said Linda Ennis.ldquoItrsquos been a tough few months, but wersquove worked hard to keep the course maintained to a high standard and itrsquos really looking the part.ldquoThe members are glad to be out playing and itrsquos great to see so many happy faces.ldquoThe last time the course was closed this long was about six or seven years ago and that was because of heavy show. It was a bit disheartening having the place empty in April and earlier this month when the weather was lovely.She added: We rely on visitors and societies for a good portion of our income, but we have had enquiries about new memberships, which is good news for us.Crossgar Golf Club president Paddy Bell heaped praise on the clubrsquos green keeping staff for having the course in great shape and also revealed there has been a surge in new members.ldquoWe have had a big uptake in new members in the past few weeks, which will help compensate for the lack of green fees, he said.ldquoWe re-opened last Wednesday and itrsquos fantastic to see people playing again. It gives you hope that everything may soonto normality.ldquoThe course is in great condition and thatrsquos due to the green keeping staff who have worked hard during the lockdown. All praise is due them.Temple Golf Club has also been inundated with membership enquiries. Since it re-opened last week it has welcomed  new junior members.Owner Tim Martin said the pandemic lockdown couldnrsquot have come at a worse time with membership subions due on April .ldquoAs like every other club, our income disappeared overnight. We depend heavily on the income from the restaurant and bar and our cash flow dwindled rapidly, Mr Martin said.ldquoWe were only able to continue paying our staff each week because of some of the loyal members who paid their fees on time. To them we are very grateful. This kept us ticking over until the government job retention scheme kicked in.Mr Martin said the members had been very accommodating and were adhering to the guidelines and protocols.ldquoWe look forward to progressing into the next stage, but will have to make sure it will be financially viable to open the restaurant and bar when the time comes, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Loughinisland man Gerry praises Move More initiative  ","story":"THERE are not many who have been to the top of the majestic Efel Tower in France.But Loughinisland man Gerry Morgan is one of the lucky few who have made it to the summit to snatch a birdrsquos eye view of the stunning Parisian landscape.That was  years ago when he opted for the easy option by popping into the lt and by-passing the , steps. Just recently, Gerry made it back to the top of the famous landmark again mdash only this time he did it from the comfort of his own home.A decade ago, Gerry enjoyed good health and loved every minute of his visit to France but in  Loughinisland GACrsquos hard-working secretary contracted lung cancer, having never smoked a day in his le.In September that year, surgeons removed one of his lungs and between then and Christmas Gerry received chemotherapy treatment to assist his road to recovery.As a result of his illness, he was referred to Macmillanrsquos lsquoMove Morersquo initiative at Down Leisure Centre in Downpatrick, which is specically designed to help people to get active and stay active with physical activity during and after most types of cancer treatment.Under the watchful eye of initiative co-ordinator Laura McGrath, Gerry loved the camaraderie of being with others referred by medical staff to take part in physical activity which can help educe the side effects of treatment, prevent the occurrence of other long-term conditions and reduce the risk of cancer spreading or ing.ldquoThere were just four of us at the start, recalled Gerry. ldquoWe started off in the old leisure centre which was subsequently replaced by a more modern building and there are now around  people who take part.ldquoWe all look forward to the classes every Thursday morning and after our warm-up routine we then proceed around a circuit and spend time on ious equipment, including a rowing machine. We also do sit-ups and squats.After the exercise regime it is time for a coffee and a chat, which all the Move More participants thoroughly enjoy.ldquoWe are literally one big family as many of us have been through cancer and fortunately come out the other side. In a way, illness has brought us together, continued Gerry.But everything changed in March when the arrival of the coronavirus forced Newry, Mourne and Down Council to close all its leisure centres and public buildings.To keep everyone involved, Laura mdash one of  Move More coordinators funded by Macmillan in every council area across the province to support those living with cancer mdash created an app to enable people to keep in touch remotely and exercise at home.She also recently unveiled a new initiative encouraging people living with cancer to virtually climb their way around some of the worldrsquos top landmarks to stay active during the coronavirus pandemic, without leaving the comfort of their own homes.Laura said that while Move More members were not able to physically travel the world at the moment, there was no limit to their imagination.Participants were given the choice of a number of buildings to scale, including Londonrsquos imposing Big Ben.Not surprisingly, Gerry opted to head back to the top of the Efel Tower, only this time he didnrsquot have to leave his front door during the virtual challenge. He set off at a leisurely pace and over three days and, with a little je nous said quoi, made it to the top.ldquoI could have completed the climb in two days, but decided to do it over three instead, he joked. ldquoI really enjoyed doing it, but miss being with my Move More friends.Gerry is pleased that while face-to-face classes and appointments are not possible, Laura has been working on positive, fun and interesting ways to keep programme participants motivated and active in the comfort of their own surroundings.He is also looking forward to getting back to the Down Leisure Centre when it is safe to do so and the pandemic is no more.Recalling the first time he went to the centre following his referral, Gerry admits that he was a little apprehensive.ldquoI distinctly remember driving to Downpatrick and was so nervous that I almost turned the car around to go back home, he said. ldquoBut I continued on and am so glad that I did. It has been an overwhelmingly positive experience for me, one that I thoroughly enjoy.ldquoI was a bit down for a few years after losing my lung and the chemotherapy, but getting involved with the Move More programme changed everything. It was just the fillip that I required.

are recommending that a proposal for a major new housing development comprising  new homes at an  acre site on the outskirts of Ballynahinch should proceed.Their recommendation to approve plans for a mixed development comprising a range of detached, semi detached and townhouses on the Lisburn Road will be discussed at next weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee.This particular committee has not met since March as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and to comply with social distancing requirements, the planning meeting will be held at Newry Leisure Centre next Wednesday.In papers submitted ahead of the meeting, the proposed development site mdash which comprises a number of fields mdash is described as ldquoirregular in shape, with the recently constructed Lime Trees, Edengrove and Kinedale developments in close proximity.Planners say that the site earmarked for the new homes is located on the ldquoinner edge of Ballynahinchrsquos development limits, with the area zoned for housing in the Down Area Plan.It is also confirmed in the planning papers that initially, plans were lodged to build  homes, but the figure was subsequently revised after planners expressed concern.The Department for Infrastructure is also content that the proposed housing scheme can be accommodated within the existing roads network.Northern Ireland Water said there is available capacity within the existing sewerage system to cope with the planned new homes, while planning permission has been granted for a new sewage pumping station on adjacent land.The papers indicate that the planning application was submitted in March  and that a number of objections to the proposed development were lodged.Other objections to the proposed housing scheme centre around traffic and access arrangements, claims that the application had not been properly advertised and insufficient neighbourhood notication.Objectors also pointed to the lack of a so-called planting buffer and the ldquolack of effort to integrate an open space area adjacent Ballynahinch River into the proposed development.Another objector highlighted the schemersquos ldquoinappropriate density, arguing that it is greater than other developments closer to the town.The detail of a noise impact assessment submitted to planners has also been questioned, but Newry Mourne and Down Council environmental health officials have expressed satisfaction with the document.The planning papers reveal that an acoustic mound has been incorporated in to the proposed development, with landscaped proposed throughout to mitigate any noise impact on adjacent land uses.In addition, the papers confirm that there is a Tree Preservation Order covering the site and while a number of trees have already been felled, this issue is the subject of an enforcement case.Planners say the proposed development is ldquoappropriate to the character and topography of the site and that ldquoadequate provision is made for public and private open space and landscaped areas as an integral part of the development.They also state that where appropriate, planted areas of discrete groups of trees will be required along site boundaries ldquoin order to soften the visual impact of the development and assist in its integration with the surrounding area, with adequate provision made for parking.Planners say that the development will not have an ldquounacceptable, adverse effect on existing or proposed properties in terms of overlooking, loss of light, overshadowing, noise or other disturbance.Next weekrsquos planning committee meeting takes place two days after the local authorityrsquos annual meeting when it is expected that Rowallane councillor, Robert Burgess, will be

It will help boost the entire thoroughbred industry.ldquoWe very much understand that racing will be behind closed doors for the foreseeable future and will work diligently to comply with the very strict protocols put in place to ensure the safety of all those attending.The July date was announced by the Board of Horse Racing Ireland, which met recently and agreed a number of fixtures for theof race meetings.The first meeting is at Naas on June , with National Hunt racing resuming at Limerick on June .For the first three weeks, racing will be restricted to nine racecourses which are more centrally located to minimise travel distances and which also have higher stable capacities given the requirement for one stable per horse under the new protocols.All the fixtures will take place under the strict protocols published by Horse Racing Ireland.Brian Kavanagh, chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland, said: ldquoWe are grateful to everybody for the patience they have shown during this very dficult time and we will provide every opportunity for essential personnel to fully understand and implement theto racing protocols.ldquoWe expect there to be signicant demand for horses to run once we resume, and we will aim to provide opportunities across the spectrum of age, gender and ability.ldquoWe will have missed  weeksrsquo racing which will take some time to catch up.

However, signs will be in place advising people where it is not safe to swim.The politicians say that council staff will be on duty at beaches, country parks and harbours to ensure required social distancing measures are adhered to. In addition, the number of visitors at the ious facilities will also be monitored, with staff carrying out regular cleaning duties.Cllr Clarke confirmed that local authority staff will be present to engage with the public around guidelines on social distancing and facility information.He said: ldquoWhile these measures will no doubt be welcomed, I would encourage people to be responsible and show consideration for others by continuing to follow the public health guidelines on social distancing and hand hygiene.Cllr Walker said the past two months have been particularly dficult for people across the district.ldquoIt has not been easy and we all hope that people will act responsibly when the beaches, country parks and harbours are reopened.

I help my clients achieve their goals by finding that balancebetween nutrition, diet, and exercise.ldquoSome clients, and a lot of men actually, have come to me with problems with anxiety and gut health. For everyone to look after their gut health is something Irsquom verypassionate about.ldquoLast week was Mental Health Awareness Week and I would like people to understand the connection thatwe are feeding our bodies processed food, it can directly impact on our brains and our mental health.Apart from working on her own health and studying to understand what diet and nutrition works for her mdash shersquos vegetarian and stays away from grains, apart from oats and barley mdash Stacey was heavily influenced by holistic approach to health during her late fatherrsquos illness.Mr John Murtagh died in  at the age of  after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer.He was initially told that he has only six months to live and Stacey and her family believe that he helped extend his le through his devotion to nutrition, juicing, mediation and his deepreligious faith.ldquoOnce we heard the news, we researched everything we could to help him nutritionally and holistically, explained Stacey. ldquoWe believe  per cent his faith and his dedication to nutrition and meditation was definitely pertinent to his added time with us. His oncologists thought he was a miracle.ldquoI think it was through what we experienced with my father and my own journey that I knew I wanted to help others nutritionally and how to find their inner happiness and peace.In , she and her brother, Jonathon, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in memory of her dad to raise nearly pound, for Marie Curie.Staceyrsquos own gut health problems were finally diagnosed while she was working in Dubai where she was able to avail of private health service through her job.ldquoI eventually found out that I have visceral hypersensitivity which is typical of IBS and means that the nerves endings in my intestines are exasperated by stress, she said.ldquoMy doctor was very interested in holistic therapies and when he found out that I was doing a lot of HITT [high intensity interval training] but still not losing weight, he recommended switching to lower intensity training such as yoga and Pilates. The dference it has made to my le, along with yoga and a balanced nutritional diet had been incredible.According to Stacey, an open mind and a willingness to test out certain foods to see what triggers your condition are essential for clients to get the right outcome.ldquoJust traditional medicine alone ndash and I would never encourage anyone not to go with traditional medicine ndash is not always the answer. Itrsquos a partnership approach with traditional side and holistic. But most importantly its listening to your own body and what feels right, said Stacey.ldquoClients need to bring a huge trust in the coaching and we really need to work between three to six months and delve quite deep into the personrsquos le to see how we can work together.ldquoIrsquom a big advocate for staying away from fad diets mdash they never worked for me. I believe you have to work to be happy and content within yourself and this is helped by making the right lestyle choices for yourself. Itrsquos about finding balance and what works for you as an inidual and settling into that lestyle.After having a fixed-term contract as a marketing manager before the lockdown, Stacey is no longer working and thinks that this might be the time to push through with yoga and heath coaching full-time.While offering free online yoga classes , Stacey is also offering a complimentary -minute health coaching interview.For further information visit www. staceymurtagh..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

People can continue to use these beautul grounds, but they must recognise the needs of the people who reside there.Cllr Andrews said people in Crossgar were delighted that members of the Passionist Community lived among them and hoped that by everyone following public health advice, it would not be long before some ldquosemblance of normality is restored for everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"UUP’s McKee takes vice chairman role  ","story":"ULSTER Unionist councillor Harold McKee has been selected as the new vice-chairman of Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The race for the deputyrsquos position was between the Mournes councillor mdash a former South Down MLA ndash and Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess.Cllr McKeersquos appointment comes weeks after the SDLP confirmed that another Mournes councillor, Laura Devlin, would be the districtrsquos new first citizen, succeeding Sinn Feinrsquos Charlie Casey.Cllr McKee said that it was an ldquoimmense privilege to have been selected as the local authorityrsquos vice-chairman and is looking forward to his new role.First elected to the former Newry and Mourne Council in , Cllr McKee said he has a proven track record of delivery for the benefit of the local community.ldquoI believe in hard work, honesty and accountability in working with local people to raise and solve issues that they care about in their daily lives, said the incoming vice-chairman.ldquoI know that the community is living through unprecedented times and many people are under huge pressure.

At the newspaper archives in Belfast, David looks at the newspaper articles from the time. David realises he was  days old when he was found: “So this means that for the first couple of weeks of my le someone fed me, clothed me, kept me warm, loved me. Someone genuinely cared.” When David learns he has a full sister who was also abandoned as a baby, he says: “It’s dficult to take it in that the same thing had happened to me happened to my sister. That’s shocking. Why do our parents make the decision to leave us  It’s happened once, so why make the decision again ”David now lives in Birmingham with his we and their three children. He also has four grown up daughters.Helen lives in Navan. She has a son and two daughters.The pair met for the first time in a guest house in Carlingford. David comments: “The only sad thing for me ispolice had been able to put two and two together at the time we could have grown up together. She’s been deprived a brother and I’ve been deprived of a wee sister.”The programme concludes dramatically as Davina McCall reveals to David and Helen the identity of the pair’s parents.Their father was a married Protestant from Dublin who was having an affair with their mother, an unmarried Catholic from Kerry.Their father had  other children with his we before David and then Helen were born out of the affair which spanned many years.David said that their parents dferent religions and the fact the babies were born out of wedlock might have been why they were abandoned.The first part of Long Lost Family: Born Without Trace was shown last night. The second part is on tonight at pm on ITV.It focuses on foundlings – people abandoned as babies, often in the first hours and days of their lives. Born without trace, with no identying information, they have had no way of unlocking the secrets of their past. In the new ground-breaking series the team behind Long Lost Family combine the latest DNA technology with painstaking detective work, to enable four foundlings to uncover their identities.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

positive impact in all areas of the county.“Almost as soon as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic became known and lockdown was implemented, the  district lodges and many private lodges in Co Armagh made spontaneous and impressive efforts to assist in their local communities.Rt Wor Bro Denis Watson, County Grand Master, and Wor Bro Jeffrey Lawson, Deputy County Grand Secretary, presenting

Zoom conference meetings and this has proved very beneficial in maintaining contact and co-ordination.” Reflecting on the work he said: “It’s a very commendable effort by the Orange brethren of Co Armagh and of course this is being replicated in other counties within the jurisdiction of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\"
