The EU Commission declined to give the exact bill, but confirmed that Mr Juncker flew with a 13-person delegation and that travel costs averaged £2,357 per person.He met Tunisian officials to discuss projects between the north African country and the EU during the trip in October. In addition, Mr Juncker, who after a pay rise will earn more than £350,000 a year, claimed £428 for a hotel and £47 for \u0027daily allowances\u0027. The cost of another private jet for a visit in November to Helsinki in Finland, where he had dinner with world leaders before attending the European People\u0027s Party conference, was up to £23,422.Again the EU Commission declined to give the exact bill, but confirmed that Mr Juncker went with an 11-person delegation and that travel costs averaged £1,953 per person.The most expensive \u0027per person\u0027 private jet trip was a one-night visit to Madrid for a lecture and to meet King Felipe VI of Spain before attending an exclusive ceremony for the Marquis de Villalobar award. Travel per person is listed as £6,734, but the overall cost of the private jet has not been revealed.A four-night tour of West Balkan countries was the second most expensive per person for travel, at £6,374.Other private jets were used when Mr Juncker was giving speeches and two were for \u0027working\u0027 dinners and lunches with German chancellor Angela Merkel. He took six private jets to events in neighbouring Germany.

Most were in Europe.For long-haul trips, such as EU-China and EU-Japan summits and a meeting with President Donald Trump in Washington in July, he used commercial airlines.Mr Juncker used his 2018 State of the EU speech to warn of the threat of climate change, which campaigners say is fuelled by emissions from air travel. He said Europeans want to \u0027leave a cleaner planet for future generations\u0027.But many of the flights he took were over relatively short distances. For example, Brussels is only 405 miles from Berlin as the crow flies.A spokesman claimed yesterday that the EU Commission is \u0027one of the most transparent administrations in the world\u0027. He also pointed out that delegations formed of several people use the private jets, bringing down the cost per head. \u0027The Commission has rules which ensure that we carry out our work – including travel – in the most cost-effective way possible,\u0027 he said. \u0027The way we spend the EU budget is controlled annually by the democratically elected European Parliament.\u0027The spokesman claimed \u0027the bulk of travel\u0027 by Mr Juncker is on commercial airlines, adding: \u0027By our own rule, the use of chartered air transport can only be considered when commercial flights are not available to reach a destination, when they cannot fit with the president\u0027s diary commitments or for security reasons.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"John Bercow reveal step Speaker","story":"    Speaker John Bercow, pictured, must announce when he will stand down as Speaker after Westminster bullying claims were \u0027swept under the carpet\u0027, a former cabinet minister said yesterdayDame Laura\u0027s inquiry recommended a shake-up of the Commons senior leadership team, but Mrs Miller said the \u0027significant issues\u0027 raised in her report appear to be being \u0027swept under the carpet\u0027. Mr Bercow has faced repeated calls to quit after the independent probe into bullying in the Commons, but has so far refused to do so.In a swipe at the Speaker, who has been in the position since 2009, Mrs Miller said that people would not speak out because \u0027they are fearful of him\u0027.Dubai sheikhs up New Year\u0027s Eve!

Famous womaniser was...Share this articleEveryone was guaranteed a prize, but at a hefty ten shillings tickets were way out of reach for ordinary citizens. The sparkling prizes were printed on garish advertisement posters put up across the land (pictured left, c.1566). Elizabeth\u0027s lottery was a way to raise money without going to Parliament (seen right in a 1559 woodcut)          This advertisement, issued c.1566, outlines how the lottery will work. This includes a list of the prizes (the prices in Tudor spelling). There would be a jackpot of £5,000 (around £850,000 in today\u0027s money) and expenses tableware for the runners-up. In the end the value of the prizes was reduced when only 10 percent of the tickets were soldThere was another even more pressing reason for Elizabeth to feel threatened. Her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots, was a Catholic with a strong claim to the English throne. Forced to abdicate the Scottish throne, the plucky Mary fled across the border in 1568. She was imprisoned but continued to inspire plots from Elizabeth’s foreign and domestic enemies.There was yet another drain on the treasury: England\u0027s status as a burgeoning imperial power. Opening up new trade routes required new expensive ships, as did the voyages of discovery that would enjoy their crowning moment in 1580 with Sir Francis Drake\u0027s successful circumnavigation of the earth.With all these demands on the royal coffers it’s no surprise Elizabeth\u0027s secretary of state, Sir William Cecil, complained that a lack of money was \u0027the principal sickness in this Court\u0027.Raising taxes would spark the ire of Parliament, so a lottery seemed the ideal solution.The initiative wasn\u0027t going to pull in a quick buck, however, as there were a whole three years before it being announced and the draw actually being held in 1569.Shivering against the winter cold, ticket holders gathered by St Paul\u0027s Cathedral in London accompanied by a beer-guzzling crowd of onlookers keen to see the flashy prizes on offer.          The draw was held on January 11, 1569 by St Paul\u0027s Cathedral in London (which is depicted as it appeared in Tudor times in a 1916 engraving). To amuse the audience, ticket-holders were allowed to hide their identities by writing jokey remarks on their tickets. These messages included anti-Catholic quips such as \u0027In God I hope and a far for the Pope\u0027      The lottery was not the money-raising success it might have been and was never repeated by Elizabeth. England was increasingly becoming a global power in the latter years of her reign. Pictured: A map of Drake\u0027s Great Expedition in 1585 by Giovanni Battista Boazio          A sign of the threat from Catholic powers came in 1570, a year after the lottery draw, when the Pope Pius V issued a Bull (or decree) declaring Elizabeth a heretic.

The EU Commission declined to give the exact bill, but confirmed that Mr Juncker flew with a 13-person delegation and that travel costs averaged £2,357 per person.He met Tunisian officials to discuss projects between the north African country and the EU during the trip in October. In addition, Mr Juncker, who after a pay rise will earn more than £350,000 a year, claimed £428 for a hotel and £47 for \u0027daily allowances\u0027. The cost of another private jet for a visit in November to Helsinki in Finland, where he had dinner with world leaders before attending the European People\u0027s Party conference, was up to £23,422.Again the EU Commission declined to give the exact bill, but confirmed that Mr Juncker went with an 11-person delegation and that travel costs averaged £1,953 per person.The most expensive \u0027per person\u0027 private jet trip was a one-night visit to Madrid for a lecture and to meet King Felipe VI of Spain before attending an exclusive ceremony for the Marquis de Villalobar award. Travel per person is listed as £6,734, but the overall cost of the private jet has not been revealed.A four-night tour of West Balkan countries was the second most expensive per person for travel, at £6,374.Other private jets were used when Mr Juncker was giving speeches and two were for \u0027working\u0027 dinners and lunches with German chancellor Angela Merkel. He took six private jets to events in neighbouring Germany.

Most were in Europe.For long-haul trips, such as EU-China and EU-Japan summits and a meeting with President Donald Trump in Washington in July, he used commercial airlines.Mr Juncker used his 2018 State of the EU speech to warn of the threat of climate change, which campaigners say is fuelled by emissions from air travel. He said Europeans want to \u0027leave a cleaner planet for future generations\u0027.But many of the flights he took were over relatively short distances. For example, Brussels is only 405 miles from Berlin as the crow flies.A spokesman claimed yesterday that the EU Commission is \u0027one of the most transparent administrations in the world\u0027. He also pointed out that delegations formed of several people use the private jets, bringing down the cost per head. \u0027The Commission has rules which ensure that we carry out our work – including travel – in the most cost-effective way possible,\u0027 he said. \u0027The way we spend the EU budget is controlled annually by the democratically elected European Parliament.\u0027The spokesman claimed \u0027the bulk of travel\u0027 by Mr Juncker is on commercial airlines, adding: \u0027By our own rule, the use of chartered air transport can only be considered when commercial flights are not available to reach a destination, when they cannot fit with the president\u0027s diary commitments or for security reasons.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/12/31/07/04E43244000003E8-0-image-m-6_1546241525207.jpg","title":"Theresa promises new chapter New Year message","story":"    Mrs May said during her New Year address that 2019 would mark a \u0027new chapter\u0027 for BritainMrs Leadsom, who was a leading pro-Leave figure in the referendum campaign, said the agreement hammered out with Brussels delivered on the 2016 vote.In an article for the Daily Mail, right, she challenged fellow Eurosceptic Tory MPs to get behind the policy or risk renewed calls for a second referendum, which she pledged to \u0027fight tooth and nail\u0027. The Leader of the House said: \u0027We can come together to support this deal, or we can throw the negotiations back into limbo and undermine our democracy.\u0027Should that happen, I know many will be demanding a second referendum andor an extension to Article 50.\u0027I will fight tooth and nail against any such outcome.

Much later in life, following the failure of his business and his marriage, he decided to turn his wartime notebooks into a memoir.After lending the (handwritten) manuscript to the historian, James Holland, a publisher came knocking.

It was a habit that lasted long through her post-war years as a pathologist, mother-of-three and wife of fellow doctor, John Bamforth.In her 60s, she even took up competitive windsurfing.For most of her life she never spoke about Bletchley Park but returned to look round in 2011. As a tour guide struggled in vain to make the last \u0027bombe\u0027 machine do its stuff, Rosemary calmly stepped forward. She hadn\u0027t clapped eyes on it in more than 65 years and soon had it working in no time.  Life was saved my magic tricksFergus Anckorn, 99          By his own admission, it was his skill as a magician which saved his life during one of the darkest chapters in British military historyAt the age of 18, he was the youngest member of the Magic Circle. By the time of his death in March, aged 99, he was the oldest. By his own admission, it was his skill as a magician which saved his life during one of the darkest chapters in British military history.Anckorn arrived with the Royal Artillery in Singapore in 1942 and was badly wounded during a Japanese air raid. He was recovering in the Alexandra Military Hospital when Japanese troops charged through bayonetting the staff and patients.One of just four survivors in a ward of 76, he was put to work on the Burma Railway where he ended up in a camp run by a ruthless sadist who was also a fan of magic. Doing simple tricks for his captors, Anckorn managed to procure enough scraps of food for himself and his comrades to make it through to the end of the war.The stress of performing one particular trick, involving an egg, was such that he was unable to perform it for another 40 years. \u0027My knees would knock even thinking about it,\u0027 he said.His story was the driving inspiration for Richard Jones, the British soldier and magician, who won Britain\u0027s Got Talent in 2016.  Wife who defied her PM husband Mary Wilson, 102Though lampooned by sections of the Press as the quiet, dutiful wife of Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson, this first lady of Downing Street was very much her own woman.Both before, during and after her husband\u0027s years in office, she was a passionate writer of poetry, producing one of the best-selling anthologies of her day. Yet she would reject nearly all requests for interviews and public appearances, up until her death in June.           From Harold\u0027s election in the Labour landslide of 1945 and on through his rapid rise through the party ranks, she preferred to remain in the wings, raising their two sonsShe met her future husband when they were both working for Lever Brothers in Cheshire. From Harold\u0027s election in the Labour landslide of 1945 and on through his rapid rise through the party ranks, she preferred to remain in the wings, raising their two sons.At the same time, however, she had a coterie of firm friends with whom she would exchange letters and poems, ranging from Prince Charles to the Poet Laureate, Sir John Betjeman.She remained impervious to her husband\u0027s politics. In 1975, as Harold Wilson led the referendum campaign to endorse Britain\u0027s entry in to the European Economic Community, Mrs Mary Wilson voted to leave.  Prince sulked for three weeks Prince Henrik of Denmark, 83Married to the long-reigning and immensely popular Queen Margrethe of Denmark, Prince Henrik was always inviting comparisons with his British opposite number.Here was a bright, talented foreign-born consort destined for a life in a supporting role to his wife. The key difference is that whereas, for the most part, Prince Philip would accept his place in the royal pecking order, Prince Henrik would become increasingly cross about his own.           Married to the long-reigning and immensely popular Queen Margrethe of Denmark, Prince Henrik was always inviting comparisons with his British opposite numberBorn a French count (he changed his name from the French \u0027Henri\u0027 to the Danish \u0027Henrik\u0027), he took on a wide range of patronages and ambassadorial roles for his adoptive land following Margrethe\u0027s accession in 1972.Yet it always rankled that a land famed for its egalitarian principles did not extend them to the monarch\u0027s husband.When the elder of their two sons was chosen to step in for the absent Queen at a national event in 2002, Henrik retreated to his French chateau in a sulk for three weeks. Sore heads and sandy beds: Revellers look worse for wear as...Jeremy Clarkson says \u0027stupid\u0027 contestants on Who Wants to be...Share this articleThough his appointment as Prince Consort in 2005 went some way to making amends, there were further outbursts in later life.He would renounce the Prince Consort title in 2016 and latterly voiced a wish to be buried alone in France. A few months before his death, in February, it was announced that he was suffering from dementia.  Money brought him nothing but miseryMatthew Mellon, 54          Mellon was born in to one of the richest families in America in 1964. He is pictured with his second wife NicoleA tragic exemplar of the old adage that money does not buy you happiness, Mellon was born in to one of the richest families in America in 1964.His great, great, great grandfather had founded one of the country\u0027s largest banks in the late 19th century. Following an expensive education, he inherited the first of 14 trust funds at the age of 21 and embarked on a life of drug-fuelled playboy partying, tempered by the occasional unsuccessful business venture.It did not help that his wife, Tamara, whom he met at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting in London in 1998, had enjoyed great success as co-founder of the Jimmy Choo shoe empire.The couple had married at Blenheim Palace in 2000 but had split, one child later, by 2004. A second marriage and two further children offered signs of a reformed character but the couple orced in 2015 and Mellon embarked on a descent from which there would be no return.  Garden from a gravel car park Beth Chatto, 94  Having been assured that she would never grow anything in the old car park next to her Essex home, Beth Chatto did just thatHaving been assured that she would never grow anything in the old car park next to her Essex home, Beth Chatto did just that, creating a Mediterranean-style gravel-based garden which became a national attraction.\u0027I really don\u0027t hold with watering,\u0027 was one of her near-heretical sayings, yet it earned her an influential posse of admirers, including the great Sussex plantsman, Christopher Lloyd.She won a remarkable ten gold medals at the Chelsea Flower Show yet refused to become part of the Royal Horticultural Society establishment, even after the RHS bestowed on her its Victorian Medal of Honour, its highest award, in 2002.  Daughter of Nazi SS chief Gudrun Burwitz, 88Known as \u0027Puppi\u0027 or \u0027Poppet\u0027 to her doting family, she was the ultimate Daddy\u0027s girl to the very end. The only problem was that Daddy was one of the most reviled specimens in modern history.Gudrun Himmler was born in Munich, in August 1929, the only daughter of the head of Hitler\u0027s SS.Though his marriage to Marga would fall apart, the architect of the \u0027Final Solution\u0027 remained devoted to his little girl. At the age of 12, she received a special treat.          Following her father\u0027s suicide in British custody 1945, she was interned by the Americans but not for long\u0027Today we went to the SS concentration camp at Dachau,\u0027 she wrote in her diary. \u0027We saw everything we could. We saw the gardening work. We saw the pear trees. We saw all the pictures painted by the prisoners. Marvellous. And afterwards we had a lot to eat. It was very nice.\u0027Following her father\u0027s suicide in British custody 1945, she was interned by the Americans but not for long. Married to author Wulf Burwitz, she worked for German intelligence during the Sixties.It clearly wasn\u0027t paying much attention to this particular member of staff. \u0027Puppi\u0027 not only remained fiercely loyal to her father\u0027s memory all through her career but was active in an organisation called Stille Hilfe (Silent Help), an outfit providing assistance to ex-SS members whose past had caught up with them. Not for nothing was she often referred to as the \u0027princess of Nazism\u0027.   Amateur cooked up Pizza ExpressPeter Boizot, 89  He couldn\u0027t cook and never had a business plan. Yet Peter Boizot has done as much to transform British eating habits as any celebrity chefHe couldn\u0027t cook and never had a business plan. Yet Peter Boizot has done as much to transform British eating habits as any celebrity chef.In 1948, working as a tutor in Florence, he was given his first slice of pizza and thought it was \u0027the most delicious thing\u0027 he had ever tasted.Years later, after a string of jobs, he decided to invest his £3,000 life\u0027s savings in a proper Italian pizza oven and found himself somewhere to set it up in London\u0027s Soho.The joint was called PizzaExpress and he opened in 1965. \u0027The pizzas came in big sheets, which I sliced up and sold for two shillings a piece,\u0027 he recalled. \u0027A friend said: \u0027You ought to let them eat with a knife and fork, and perhaps offer a round one\u0027. So I started making round ones.\u0027He created a totally new ambiance — with plants, black and white tiles, a staff uniform — and imported Italian beer. He would offer washing-up jobs to the homeless and slapped a surcharge on his Veneziana pizzas which went to the Venice in Peril Fund.After selling out for £40 million in 1993, he invested heavily in his native Peterborough, although he had resisted opening a branch there for many years. There were, he explained, just too many Italians living there.   Hoaxer faked his own deathAlan Abel, 94          In the Fifties, he created the \u0027Society for Indecency to Naked Animals\u0027 as a joke and urged people to put clothing on farm animals and pets to cover their modestyA serial prankster in the Ali G mould, Alan Abel achieved fame for hoodwinking the American people — and media — time and again during his long life.In the Fifties, he created the \u0027Society for Indecency to Naked Animals\u0027 as a joke and urged people to put clothing on farm animals and pets to cover their modesty. Suddenly, it caught on with national television coverage and even a donation of $40,000.Other hoaxes included a presidential campaign led by a (non-existent) Jewish housewife called Yetta, using his wife for radio interviews, his mother\u0027s photo and the slogan: \u0027Vote Yetta and things will get betta\u0027.In 1974, the media flocked to a press conference to hear the missing section of the notorious Watergate tapes — and heard a blank tape.His favourite con was when he faked his own death in 1980, in order to read his own obituary. He was thrilled when the New York Times devoted more space to him than to the inventor of the six-pack.On September 14, 2018, however, the joke really was over — as was Alan Abel."},{"url":null,"title":"Hope childless couples MPs vote end disgraceful IVF postcode lottery","story":"    Emma and Lee Edey, 44, from Colchester, Essex, were about to start IVF three years ago but the funding was axed and are praying the law changes this yearGenerous grandparents \u0027are fuelling the nation\u0027s obesity...Prime Minister promises to clamp down on banks, phone...Final surge of Mail reader recruits sees 2,500 sign up to be...Theresa May says Britain will be free to tackle NHS...Share this articleChildless couples given hope the postcode lottery for free IVF will end this year - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"Schumacher freaked public appearances manager reveals five years ski accident","story":"    Michael Schumacher (pictured) \u0027always freaked out\u0027 during public appearances and the traits that helped him succeed on the track sometimes held him back \u0027in the human field\u0027          The German Formula 1 great, who suffered life-changing head injuries in a ski accident in December 2013, could be a \u0027complex human being\u0027, according to his manager Sabine Kehm (pictured)          Speaking on the fifth anniversary of the devastating accident, Schumacher\u0027s former spokesperson described the driver as \u0027faithful, reliable, dutiful and fact-driven\u0027.

I watched the race together with Michael Schumacher in his house in Switzerland.\u0027Todt, who said he visits the seven-time F1 champion \u0027at least twice a month\u0027 in Switzerland, revealed he found it hard to talk about Schumacher, who suffered his injuries while skiing with son Mick in Meribel in the French Alps.          Kehm became Schumacher\u0027s manager in 2010\u0027I almost cry. There are pictures of him all over my offices and apartments. The time with Michael will always be remembered as the best of my life,\u0027 Todt said.Schumacher, who turns 50 this month, hit the right side of his head on a rock, splitting open his helmet when he fell while skiing.He was rushed to hospital where he underwent several life-saving surgeries and spent the next six months in a coma.In April 2014, Schumacher woke up and was taken from the hospital in Grenoble to a private location, believed to be his house near Lake Geneva, where he is being cared for.It is thought that Michael is being tended to by a team of 15 physicians who provide round-the-clock care at a cost of £115,000-per-week.At the time of his release from hospital, his wife Corinna issued a statement asking for support in \u0027our joint fight alongside Michael\u0027, but said she would not be speaking further and asked for privacy.The couple married in 1995 after meeting at a Ferrari party, and have two children together: Gina-Maria, 21, and Mick, 19, who races Formula Three.Mick won the Formula Three championship with a race to spare last month, and will now make the move to Formula Two with Italian team, Prema in 2019.Kehm typically issues the rare statements on behalf of the family to the press, while his lawyers speak on his behalf in court.In comments from 2016, which have only been published recently, Khem said Schumacher \u0027secretly dreamed\u0027 of disappearing from public life.\u0027Once in a long discussion Michael said to me: You don\u0027t need to call me for the next year, I\u0027m disappearing.

I never wanted to give up looking for her\u0027. In October this year, Norah flew to Canada to meet her \u0027second family\u0027 - and met the huge Campbell clan in their hometown, Campbellford, Ontario.She spent Thanksgiving with them and says she has a lot to be grateful for - including the love and affection shown to her by the family who raised her after she was adopted in 1955.          Margaret Campbell actually went by the name Rita, making her daughter\u0027s search for her more difficult  but they finally met in 2016 (pictured)Norah added: \u0027I\u0027m eternally grateful - I told her \u0027if it wasn\u0027t for you, I wouldn\u0027t have my five grandchildren\u0027.\u0027She created all these lives by going through what she did.\u0027I had to say that to her.\u0027Grandmother-of-five Norah was finally able to get in touch with her birth mother after a TV production company helped with her research.Two years ago, Rita travelled all the way from Canada to Scotland to meet her daughter and they were reunited at Glasgow Airport.Norah, from Dumbarton, West Dunbartonshire said: \u0027My mother was unmarried when she had me, and her parents took control. She never had a say in the matter.\u0027Care worker Norah was inspired to seek out her birth mother after being told at a guest at her own wedding \u0027Your mother would be very proud of you\u0027.The glamorous bride was aged 19 when she wed ex-husband Kenneth McMaster and was shocked when her ancestry was mentioned.But with the demands of raising four children, Andrew, Gregor, Ross and Lesley, and the tragic loss of her first child, Kenneth, her intentions of tracking down the woman who gave birth to her fell by the wayside.And Norah was afraid of upsetting her adoptive parents John and his second wife, Peggy, who he married after the death of his first wife, also named Norah.She described the couple as \u0027exceptional\u0027 and loving.After their deaths, she trawled through records in Edinburgh and discovered that when she was born, the name given to her was Anne.          Rita Campbell meets four children of her long-lost daughter on a visit to Scotland  Norah, pictured age 6, had always wanted to find her birth mother but also felt torn about upsetting the parents who brought her up as their own Her mother\u0027s name was listed as Margaret Campbell, who lived in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire.          Norah knew about her past but waited until the 1990s to properly search for her mother - but success only came two years agoNorah pulled up the addresses of people named Margaret Campbell who still lived in the neighbourhood, but drew only blanks and even knocked on doors in the area but to no avail.But Margaret Campbell was actually known as Rita and living on the other side of the world in Canada.They were reunited with the help of television producers and began to exchange letters - eventually speaking for the first time on Mother\u0027s Day.Norah said: \u0027We look alike, we think alike - it is so similar, it\u0027s uncanny. My mum kept her secret all her life, there was only one of her brothers who knew. Their initial letters were short and pragmatic, addressing medical history.\u0027I think she was in shock and couldn\u0027t quite believe it. It was the most surreal feeling\u0027. For the first time in 61 years, mother and daughter were able to embrace - as when the baby was born, she had been taken away from Rita immediately.Norah said: \u0027Her hands were tied, she didn\u0027t have any part in the decision.

There are no tour dates listed for him on his professional website. Five women accused Louis CK of sexual misconduct in November 2017, which he later admitted to.  The women were mostly comedians who said he asked to watch them masturbate or forced them to watch him masturbate. For years rumors swirled that the comedian used his status and power to harass female comedians. After the allegations arose, the comedian immediately confessed they were true.   \u0027These stories are true. What I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your d*ck isn\u0027t a question. It\u0027s a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly,\u0027 he said in a statement released just a day after the allegations came forward. Despite his confession, he faced no legal consequences for the sexual misconduct.However, his stand-up special was cut from Netflix and his relationship with HBO and FX were also axed.   Just nine months later he returned to the spotlight.   "},{"url":null,"title":"Supercar shutdown vehicles clog streets London New Years Day","story":"    A Ferrari 458 is admired as it cruises through London this afternoon.

It came right out of the blue and he had been considering it for a few days. I just couldn\u0027t believe it.\u0027The couple also arranged another meeting with senior management at FirstPort in an attempt to iron out and build bridges following the bitter dispute but true reconciliation felt some way off for Geoff and Ruth.

I have begun talking myself as a whistle-blower!\u0027Mr Scott said: \u0027Me and around 24 of my friends in the flats had a fish and chip supper to celebrate Ray\u0027s help. It\u0027s was a free event to thank our friends for their support from Ruth and myself. It\u0027s been a very quiet Christmas... until they read this!\u0027The bid to oust the Scott\u0027s from their home stemmed from \u0027the envious wrath\u0027 of a cluster of residents who resented the 75-year-old\u0027s attempts to create an enjoyable social life in the sedate but stale block of flats which Geoffrey jokingly nicknamed \u0027God\u0027s waiting room,\u0027 shortly after moving into Pinewood Court in Bournemouth, Dorset in October 2013.Mr Scott said: \u0027It all began with a coach trip to Hampshire. It was such a success we went on to organise a mystery tour and we took about 20 of the neighbours on a holiday to Eastbourne. We have also run holidays to the Isle of Wight and to Torquay.\u0027After six months we organised more with the permission of Molly, who was the previous flats\u0027 manager. I have never asked for money for doing this - funds were raised through raffles and the like. Then suddenly, this group of six people took umbrage with me doing this.\u0027It was apparent that our fellow elderly residents were staying in their flats and not doing anything to pass the time, so we introduced card games and cake afternoons and bingo and even a fish and chip evening.          Geoffrey Scott (pictured above) had never imagined they would face a five-year campaign of jealousy to hound them out of their home\u0027All of a sudden people were energised and taking part - and really loving life a lot more. I was so pleased.\u0027However, the retirement resort\u0027s new lease of life quickly turned sour for the Scotts when the quiet crusade of the clique of embittered residents received \u0027legitimacy\u0027 from the new manager, Ms. Julie Whitney (corr), on her arrival six months ago.Mr Scott, a retired aircraft structure designer, said: \u0027Originally Julie, the new manager, started saying what a marvellous place she wanted to turn it into with holidays and coach trips. However, she appeared upset when she realised all of her ideas had already been introduced - by me.          Geoffrey Scott (pictured above) had tried to offer other residents more of a vibrant social life when he first moved to the residency \u0027We think she wanted to turn it into a care home! Pinewood Court is actually 42 flats with about 50 people living healthy, independent lives with ages ranging of 65 to 98 years. The main instigator against my good deeds was a gentleman who began shouting at me down the hall, saying: \u0027Here he comes, here comes, the governor!\u0027\u0027Molly, now she is not working here, can say the things she heard around the home. She told me that this man said to her: \u0027I want to stab him in the back\u0027 - I didn\u0027t hear about this until four months ago.For Mr Scott, there was only one obvious reason why the group began their crusade against him simply for offering Pinewood Court a vibrant social life.He said: \u0027It was jealousy perhaps that they hadn\u0027t done it themselves, or perhaps they were jealous that someone came in and introduced all this stuff. But on the very first fish and chip evening I organised all these moaners came along and enjoyed it!\u0027But the five or six people started taking umbrage with others having fun. This went on until Molly retired about six months ago and the new manager and this group quickly became friends and turned her against me.One of the gentlemen in clique, I met in a lift. I held my hand out, and said let\u0027s call this a day, I don\u0027t like this atmosphere - and he totally snubbed me and walked away.\u0027\u0027These incidents escalated to the point where the building\u0027s management firm, FirstPort, contacted my landlady insisting she terminates our tenancy. Is this FirstPort\u0027s way of getting rid of a whistle-blower?\u0027Friends and family have told me to go to the police.

Like many in the audiobook world, he believes this commercial success has coincided with a creative flourishing.He says the potential of book narration became apparent after his marathon recording of the English language version of Karl Ove Knausgaard’s acclaimed six-part book series, My Struggle.“Narrating these books was not only personally extraordinary, but at the vanguard of the evolving art of narration,” he told the .The completion of book six this year, for the New York-based Recorded Books, marks the end of a project that has taken five years to finish. The six volumes clock in at more than 133 hours, one of the the longest commercial recordings by a single narrator and almost twice as long as unabridged recordings of the Bible.Ballerini says recording My Struggle was the most difficult job in a 23-year acting career that has included roles in The Sopranos and the film Dinner Rush. Feedback from listeners highlighted how audiobooks, and the way they are consumed on smartphones, provide an intimate new way to reach audiences, he says. “The relation between narrator and listener has become much more personal. You’re in their home, lying in bed with them, in their cars, in the gym, or wherever it. It’s very one-on-one, there’s no sound or visual effects, it is just a voice in their heads.”He adds: “With the Karl Ove recordings people have written me in very personal ways about their experience of listening, which I’ve not gotten from any other project.”An artist told Ballerini she heard his voice in her paintings after listening to him reading Knausgaard as she worked. Another fan sent him pottery she said Ballerini’s recording had helped her to create. A couple who were stranded by snow for weeks said the My Struggle recordings helped them survive the winter.Some take issue with Ballerini’s description of it as a new art form. The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has run a a talking books service for more than 80 years.Daryl Chapman, the studios manager at the RNIB, says: “I wouldn’t say narration is a new art form, rather one that’s been evolving over time.”Oral storytelling dates back to the earliest days of human language. “Cultures often venerated professional story tellers even though they weren’t generating new stories so much as re-telling the old ones,” says Joseph Devlin, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London. Devlin’s research found listening to stories increased people’s emotional engagement more than watching video.“I agree with Ballerini that there is an intimacy in the audio format. As a listener you engage more by virtue of co-creating the content with the narrator.”Paul Stokes, the founder of the blog Audiobook Review, says: “In less than 10 years, the world of audiobooks has exploded. Using smartphones enables listeners, authors, and narrators to connect on many different levels.”He cites the example of Soundbooth Theatre, which runs live narrations based on YouTube requests, allowing audiences to have a say on how characters are read.Knausgaard approved the casting of Ballerini to read his books, but the two men have never met. “I was afraid meeting the man would shatter some things, and I’ve not even listened to him speak,” Ballerini says.But now that the project is complete, he is keen to meet someone he regards as “the author I was born to narrate”. Ballerini treasures a signed copy of book three of the series in which Knausgaard describes him as “my American voice”.Ballerini says he sometimes found it difficult to get out of character, when channelling Knausgaard. “I felt like it had gotten under my skin so deeply. It was like he was opening a window for me to see my own life. Maybe that’s the case with a lot of people, which is why the books are so compelling.”He says the experience of reading the 3,600 pages aloud was like “a big therapy session”, and admits to dreaming about Knausgaard and incidents in the books.Sarah Shrubb, an audio publisher at Little, Brown Book Group, says narrators often break down in tears reading aloud in the studio, especially when authors are reading their own work.“It’s incredibly difficult and you don’t have the feedback of an audience. It’s just you and the microphone creating these amazing soundscapes in your head. You have to play all of the characters and all their voices, and to be able to do them well is a real art form.”Shrubb says drama schools are beginning to take notice. “It is becoming an art form that is being taught in colleges. It is not just something actors do between jobs, it’s a career.”Ballerini acknowledges that his view of the status of audiobooks is an unusual one. “To describe an audiobook as being the largest thing of someone’s career is probably a new kind of claim,” he said. “But it is one that I stand by.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a00ef9a37a0242b0406e5b2faa7c6daf608e63d2/2_43_1732_1039/master/1732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3722245d72a1345fe7c2fcca2d5ae9fd","title":"how to be invisible kate bush review","story":"The singer-songwriter’s lyric collection is free of explanation yet still explores her curiosity for life and loveTrust Kate Bush, never one to explain, to complicate the straightforward lyrics collection. She doesn’t annotate this anthology, unlike Neil Tennant’s recent Faber edition. Instead, subtler direction follows an introduction by author David Mitchell, who wrote the spoken-word parts of Bush’s 2014 Before the Dawn performances. Mitchell intermingles charming fannish detail with close textual analysis that illuminates familiar songs: it is God, he points out, not the devil, who allows the man and woman to exchange their sexual experiences on Running Up That Hill, an act of inity rather than transgression.But Mitchell is wrong on one key point. “Kate’s the opposite of a confessional singer-songwriter in the mould of Joni Mitchell during her Blue period,” he asserts. “You don’t learn much about Kate from her songs.” Which begs the question of how we might know a songwriter. It’s true that Bush’s personal life is so opaque that an interview betraying her Netflix habits offered grounding intimacy. Another where she described Theresa May as “the best thing that’s happened to us in a long time” burst a bubble some fans were keen to preserve. More dispiriting than partisan matters was her opinion that “it is great to have a woman in charge of the country”. If Bush’s songwriting tells us anything, it’s that her understanding of gender and power is typically more complex.This understanding is one thread of How to Be Invisible, which splits selections from her catalogue across 10 newly curated sections, offering no clear framing devices. (Only Aerial’s A Sky of Honey suite and Hounds of Love’s second side, The Ninth Wave, remain intact.) Here is how we might find her, wedding Snowflake and Hounds of Love into a consideration of the perils of succumbing to love contemplating alchemy and evolution from Cloudbusting, about a child losing faith in a parent, to Bertie, a tribute to how her son transformed her life. She addresses loss movingly: Aerial’s A Coral Room finds the memory of her late mother in “her little brown jug” The Fog, from The Sensual World, asks how to love when its objects are transient. Houdini and Get Out of My House bookend her strident interrogation in how to remain open to pleasure but protected from deception.Two sections dwell on gender. Joanni, her portrait of Joan of Arc, is juxtaposed with an indictment of masculine warmongering (Army Dreamers). Later, Bush explores masculine and feminine perspectives, contemplating desire (Reaching Out) and obligation (Night in the Swallow), never reaching trite conclusions.If there is one to be drawn from How to Be Invisible, it isn’t that Bush is unknowable, but that life is: how much can we ever know about love, ourselves, the things we lose? She is never cowed by the uncertainty. Her songwriting suggests the only way to weather it is with curiosity applying silliness as courageously as literary seriousness, balancing spiritual insight alongside unabashed carnality, domestic truth alongside fantasy, never concerned by contradictions.Desire runs wild in the final section: Mrs Bartolozzi’s sexual laundry fantasia the wily, windy Wuthering Heights. This headstrong pursuit has guided Bush. The question is not what we can learn about her, but what we might learn from following her lead.• How to Be Invisible by Kate Bush is published by Faber (£14.99).

But only the big players have the muscle to surviveImagine a shopper in an electronics store. Look, there’s a Fitbit display, with its “activity bands” which measure your steps and show details. Or, more pricey, its Versa smartwatch. Perhaps to save money, just buy the activity band? But wait … just over there are some generic activity bands, and they’re cheaper. Maybe save some money with those.Move along a bit, and there are GoPro cameras. But once again, there are some slightly cheaper models beside them not well-known brands, but a camera is a camera, surely? Further along, there’s a Parrot drone. Next to those is a Sonos speaker, which works with Amazon’s Alexa. But beside it is a cheaper Amazon Echo, and a voice-controlled Google Home, and a Siri-enabled Apple HomePod. Why would you go with the smaller brand, faced with those offerings from tech’s behemoths? Or, at the previous displays, why not just buy the cheaper models?That’s the challenge for many consumer electronics firms. Not how to make things, or how to distribute them and get them in front of potential buyers. It’s how to make a profit. Out of Fitbit, GoPro, Parrot and Sonos – each operating in different parts of the consumer electronics business – only the latter made an operating profit in the last financial quarter, and all four have made a cumulative operating loss so far this year.That, together with the rise of a gigantic electronic manufacturing capability in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, about an hour’s drive north of Hong Kong, has made the modern hardware business one where only those with huge reserves of capital and brand recognition can hope to thrive. Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and Sony can probably rely on their brand name after that, it’s survival of the fittest.So is it already game over for GoPro and the rest? None is a newcomer. GoPro was founded in 2002 by Nick Woodman, who wanted to capture better pictures of a surfing trip to Australia it came to market in June 2014. Sonos was also founded in 2002, focusing on multi-room high-quality sound, and came to the market earlier in 2018. Fitbit was set up in March 2007, and joined the stock market in June 2015. Parrot is the oldest of them all, founded in 1994 and has made many consumer electronics products, including a voice-recognition system (in 1995) and a Bluetooth-based hands-free kit for cars in 2000.Fitbit is struggling to move away from fitness bands – simple devices that record steps and calories burnt – where low-cost Chinese products are swamping the market. It is trying to shift into smartwatches, which are higher-priced, have more uses and generate higher customer loyalty. But it’s not easy in the first nine months of the year it sold 8.4m fitness bands – and 2.8m smartwatches. The opportunity is there: Fitbit has 25m users who pay a subscription to its services, and could be future smartwatch buyers. But in the most recent quarter it made a $200m (£157m) operating loss on sales of $940m and over the past eight quarters it has made a net loss of $624m. Its shares, which hit $47 soon after its IPO in 2015, are now $4.97.GoPro has managed to stabilise its unit sales, at about 1m per quarter, but profitability has remained elusive. So it is trying to encourage owners on to a subscription offering, at $5 per month so far 185,000 have signed up, generating about $11.1m a year. That’s about the same revenue as selling an extra 44,000 cameras – but the profit on subscriptions, as with software, is far higher than on the hardware. Its shares are currently at $4.24, down from $87 in 2014.“It’s harder for any company that focuses mainly on hardware to survive in the long term,” says Francisco Jeronimo, a smartphone analyst for the research group IDC. “But the big problem for many of these companies is that there isn’t a strong incentive to keep buying them. I might buy a GoPro, but I don’t need it on a daily basis if I have a smartphone. Same with Parrot – it’s a very niche segment. These companies were so eager to get to an IPO that they took advantage of the hype around their category, but haven’t been able to reinvent themselves, and they need to do that to keep alive.”The risk for such companies is that they are consigned to the virtual, or real, cupboard under the stairs to gather dust, while smartphone capability expands to take on functions that once needed a separate device.Yet it’s never been easier to make and sell hardware. Crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo provide easy ways to find early adopters who will stake money on entrepreneurs with unproven designs, which can then be realised in Shenzhen. The Pebble smartwatch raised $10.3m as a Kickstarter project in 2012, then its biggest-ever fundraising it topped that in 2015, raising $20.3m for a newer model. Yet in December 2016 it announced it would close, citing financial trouble. (Fitbit bought its intellectual property – essentially, the smartwatch software – for $23m.) “Crowdfunding sites are great for attracting early adopters, but the majority of consumers don’t go there,” says Jeronimo. “It misleads companies into thinking their category is going to explode.”Even while it tried to expand beyond those early adopters, Pebble’s problem (which is now also Fitbit’s problem) was that Apple launched its own smartwatch in 2015, and quickly became the largest smartwatch maker. Sonos, similarly, found that a market it once had to itself – multi-room speakers streaming music and radio from the internet – turned into a jostling match with Amazon in 2014, followed by Google and most recently, Apple. Suddenly, everyone is making a “smart speaker”, and Sonos’s hardware-only model has come into sharp focus because it doesn’t have a native voice assistant (it is adding Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s ‘OK Google’).The ability for the big players to squash smaller players isn’t unique to hardware Facebook has tried to do it to rivals such as Snapchat. But in hardware, firms such as Sonos find themselves assaulted by both the big brands and the unheard-of ones leveraging Shenzhen and Amazon’s distribution.Sonos’s response has been to insist that people will move upmarket, to its better sound quality. It is also looking for collaborations, most notably with Ikea, whose fruits are promised in 2019. Patrick Spence, the Sonos CEO, is confident he can rely on the existing Sonos user base of 20m devices across 7.4m households.The squeeze on smaller hardware players has played out before, in PCs and smartphones. In the mid-1990s, the PC market was dominated by American companies such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Gateway, Apple, Compaq, NCR, Packard Bell and Zenith. As manufacturing costs in the US rose, they shifted production to Taiwan, South Korea and, gradually, China – only to be usurped by local rivals using that manufacturing expertise and building international distribution networks. Now, only Dell, HP and Apple remain the three other biggest PC makers are Acer and Asus, of Taiwan, and China’s Lenovo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a62bc630fd0f7c9d0f704be2ac135be8321636c7/0_19_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e88487166c68c30f7802bdc71404070","title":"1989 eastern europe britain optimism","story":"Whatever happened to the future? Brexiteers cling on to a fantastical mixture of empire, war and an England whose genius was supposedly embodied by Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher. In the United States, Donald Trump harks back to an America of economic might: musclebound men toiling in car factories and coalmines, and splendid isolation. A recent issue of the Economist surveyed politics in Europe and the US and observed “an orgy of reminiscence”, partly traceable to the fact that millions of westerners cannot shake off a deep and understandable sense of decline.There’s an obvious irony in having to look back to find something better, but 2019 marks the 30th anniversary of a run of events that embodied pretty much the polar opposite: optimism, faith in the future and a sense of shared humanity that could not be more different from the polarised, rancorous mood of today. As this year unfolds, the events of 1989 – a year as replete with significance as 1848, 1945 or 1968 – will be celebrated and picked apart in Berlin there will be an impressive run of commemorative events . Leafing through histories of the time, and thinking back to what happened, what most sticks out is a set of emotions and impulses that we would do well to revive: defiance, joy, an urge to run headlong into whatever happened next.The year 1989 was one of largely peaceful revolutions that swept through central and eastern Europe, calling time on Soviet communism. In that region of the world, humanity confronted a wall of power that surreally crumbled away. If you want a sense of what was suddenly afoot, have a look at the famous footage of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu on 21 December 1989 unsuccessfully attempting to subdue a crowd suddenly full of a sense of their collective power, and thereby realising he was finished.Six months before, when the same spirit of defiance surfaced in Beijing, the result was the carnage of Tiananmen Square, though events there gave the world another vivid image of what it is to directly confront your oppressor: the famous lone protester – whose identity remains unknown – standing before a line of tanks, vainly trying to stop the inevitable. That picture now stands as a breathtaking embodiment of 1989’s emancipatory spirit, and how easily it could be snuffed out. But in eastern Europe, a sense of liberation and possibility seemed to prevail, and even to reach the crabby old UK.Alexandra Richie’s masterful history of Berlin, Faust’s polis, rightly characterises what happened in the German capital in 1989 as the culmination of a story that had begun elsewhere in the old eastern bloc: in Poland, Hungary and, perhaps most crucially, the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev. But she evokes the wonderment that transpired as people walked in amazement from East to West: “Delirious crowds continued to surge across – some in their nightclothes and bedroom slippers everyone sensed that this was a moment that they would savour for the rest of their lives ... the party lasted well into the night Radio Sender Freies Berlin said that more than 50,000 had crossed into West Berlin on that first night alone, people who had come ‘just to see’, for the night.”Closer to home, the upsurge known as acid house had decisively arrived in the summer of 1988, and quickly attracted a mixture of tabloid outrage, government hostility and police suppression. Its two basic components were electronic (and futuristic) dance music, and ecstasy – the drug that filled its users with the euphoric sense of connection to others known as being “loved up”. The result, played out every week in the huge Manchester club the Hacienda, was perfectly described to me by its co-owner, Tony Wilson: “You could take any human being, of any sort, to the Hacienda from mid-89 onwards and they would just love it. Human beings love fun and happiness and exuberance, and it was the epitome of that.”I was one of those people. If anything, Wilson’s testament was an understatement. It may seem fanciful to draw lines between scenes on British dancefloors and what was afoot in former communist countries, but they are obvious enough. The 1980s had been a decade of social ision, nuclear paranoia and endless strife. Now, if you were in the right place at roughly the right time, what seemed to be superseding all that was a profound sense that a new era was opening, and many of the miseries of the previous decade would be over. By the end of 1990, Nelson Mandela was out and Thatcher was out seven years later, the fact that New Labour was able to seize on a mood of pop-cultural optimism was proof that some of 1989’s spirit had lingered on.But as the Blair years would prove, the legacy of 1989 would also curdle into hubris. In the summer of 89, the American economist Francis Fukuyama famously declared the final triumph of liberalism and the alleged end of history, a belief enacted in the real world by the application of brutal free-market economics to the newly liberated countries of eastern Europe, which spread a resentment that still runs deep. The fate of the Balkans proved that the euphoria of 1989 was often completely misplaced. And the same arrogance that defined the western powers’ economic policies would lead on to the Iraq war – a fatal application of the cursed concept of “liberal interventionism”, which was 1989-era triumphalism all over.Today Poland and Hungary are bywords for nostalgic populism. In Russia, Vladimir Putin’s raison d’etre seems to be avenging the west’s post-89 humiliation of his country, re-rooting its self-esteem in the Soviet era. In contrast to 1989’s all-too-brief burst of people power, we seem to be stranded in an era of strongmen and rampant nationalism, in which the open, liberating nature of 1989’s crowds has been superseded by the baying of online mobs. And for all that pop music and its surrounding culture still seem to offer a erse, colourblind antidote to the nastiness and hatred in our midst, an upsurge as huge and transformative as acid house seems unthinkable.All of which comes down to a set of obvious iron rules: that parties have to end, that history speeds on, and that things always turn out to be much more complicated than they first appear. Nonetheless, across the world, the social liberalism and internationalism that defines a large share of my generation and took deep root among millennials is one of 1989’s obvious legacies and the fact that Trump, Brexit and the new populism are so loudly contested is proof that the world really did change. And, as 1989 teaches us, everything will sooner or later change again. The demagogues and chancers of our time will have their own Ceaușescu moments, and today’s walls will eventually come down."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97e45c07b0b8911d01c13fdc064c941ecd7170c9/0_55_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=220\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e14b1873273d9302a71ea262a50d47ee 440w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of fizz","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘fizz’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘fizz’ (please note that these are no longer published online).Share your photos of what fizz means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 2 January at 10am.

Once a rowdy lumber town, it quietly developed into one of the country’s most handsome and liveable cities federal money backed impressive architecture and still supports a rash of top-flight national museums, while careful planning kept the city centre walkable and put the great outdoors a mere 15-minute drive away. There’s also a sizeable gastro and brewpub scene, along with a packed festival calendar. And there’s an appetite for some unusual activities too: how about the weekly mass drop-in yoga sessions on the parliament’s iconic lawns, or ice-skating the Rideau canal – the world’s largest rink – in the very centre of the city with a BeaverTail pastry in hand? See it for yourself …Food and drink form a big part of the Ottawa lifestyle. Farmers’ markets always bustle and hot new restaurants continually pop up around a city that already boasts the full range of choices, including dozens of ethnic eateries in districts such as Chinatown. Try the classic French cuisine at Sur Lie, or the innovative menus at Stofa. Elsewhere, the emphasis is often on casual and healthy, with modern vegetarian places such as Pure Kitchen as popular as any. Ottawa’s microbreweries all thrive too, with craft ales universally loved: the city’s beer festivals, such as the Winter Brewfest in February or the Ottawa Beerfest in June, burst at the seams brewery bus tours thrive and getting a table at a hip beer-focused restaurant, such as Bar Lupulus can be a challenge.

The race weekend features a 10km runwalk, a half marathon, and a full marathon that takes participants through Fogo’s beautiful, untamed wilderness. If you’re not running yourself, you can cheer on the returning marathoners in the picturesque village of Tilting, or go for a scenic hike through the island’s 200km of paths and trails. It’s worth the ferry ride alone to stay and dine at the architecturally stunning Fogo Island Inn.

The 2019 Open will be played at the historic Hamilton Golf and Country Club, in Ancaster, Ontario. Thanks to recent changes to the PGA calendar, the Canadian Open has been moved to early June, a change that is likely to attract more top-ranked golfers, some of whom had previously been unable to come north due to scheduling. If all that polite clapping at the Open has you itching to hit the links yourself, you’ll want to head north to the Muskoka Bay Club. Ranked as one of the best in Ontario, this Doug Carrick-designed course incorporates the rugged beauty of the region into the course layout and provides a distinctly Canadian golfing experience.Global Relay Canadian Road Championships – Victoria, British Columbia, June 2019Victoria, BC, will once again host the Global Relay Canadian Road Championships in June 2019.

To get ahead on summer 2019 fashion, the footwear to buy into is the humble flip-flop. The thonged sandal – which dates back to at least 4000BC – is, of course, a regular sight from beach to city street every summer. But it hasn’t been properly fashionable, arguably, since the early 00s, when women like Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen made it as integral to their LA around-town look as XXXL sunglasses and four-figure handbags worn hooked over one arm.With this era rediscovered by a generation of people who were children around the turn of the millennium, it makes sense that flip-flops are in focus again. They were a trend among influencers at Copenhagen fashion week this year – increasingly a site for emerging street style.Designers from Michael Kors to Molly Goddard featured versions of flip-flops on the catwalk for spring. The Olsen sisters, meanwhile, have consistently worn them. When a photograph of the duo for WSJ magazine was shared on Instagram in August to announce the addition of menswear to their fashion line The Row, it was the black flip-flops they were wearing that caused a frenzy. The post has so far received more than 10,000 likes.Retailers including Net-a-Porter and Asos are tipping the flip-flop as the style for summer 2019. “Flip-flops are a big deal for Asos for spring,” says Aisling McKeefry, Asos head of design. “Originally evolving from Instagram, the trend is for simple toe thong designs on to flats and super-sexy glam heels. Toe loops are also going to be trending.”Elizabeth von der Goltz, global buying director at Net-a-Porter, agrees, saying: “For springsummer 19, Staud are doing this trend particularly well with their chic asymmetric styles in a variety of textured and leather colourways. Chloé too have amazing wrap versions. We’re excited to have bought heavily into these collections for next season.”The stylist Jeanette Friis Madsen, a street-style favourite who was photographed in flip-flops at Copenhagen fashion week, believes their relatability means they are a sure thing for the summer. “They’re easy, affordable, comfortable, casual and fun,” she says. Rather than saving flip-flops for the beach, she advises using them as a way to bring a casual edge to daytime outfits. “They’re perfect to downgrade a flashy summery dress,” she says. “Or mix them up with a pair of wide suit trousers for an effortless expression.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The crisis-hit House of Fraser and an embattled Marks \u0026amp Spencer made headlines, as did a rising tally of planned store closures, and accompanying job losses, deemed necessary in a turnaround plan for New Look. The Orla Kiely brand, famed for its geometric prints, went into liquidation in September, while Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana ends the year under serious pressure, having been dropped by important retailers after a racism scandal shipwrecked a fashion show planned in China.But the most significant downfall to impact on the culture of fashion is that of a store still very much open for business. The undoing of Philip Green, and by association Topshop, is a watershed moment for British high street fashion.Hit by multiple accusations of bullying and sexual harassment, Green was further humiliated by being dropped by as a business partner by Beyoncé, who cut ties between her Ivy Park athleisure brand and Topshop after the allegations. The launch event for Topshop’s keynote partywear collection this season, a collaboration with the up and coming designer Michael Halpern, was cancelled at the last moment. There will be no star-studded parties celebrating Topshop’s place at the centre of the British fashion ecosystem this year, for the simple reason that it can no longer lay claim to that position.This decade has seen the young shoppers who are Topshop’s key market moving from bricks-and-mortar shopping, a field in which Topshop was dominant, to online, in which it faced stiff competition from new and nimble, social media-savvy, price-competitive brands such as Boohoo and Missguided. Furthermore, the BHS pension scandal of 2016 had cut into the personal fortune of Green and his wife, Tina, and forced him to step back from the limelight.The Topshop catwalk shows at which Green would position himself centre-stage, once a biannual sight at London fashion week, have been consigned to history. In his pomp, Green gave himself the prime paparazzi spot each season: next to Kendall Jenner in February 2014, Cara Delevingne in February 2015, Anna Wintour in September 2015, and Kate Moss in September 2017.In 2018, however, there were no Topshop catwalk shows at London fashion week. The programme of sponsoring catwalks for emerging designers, along with the lavish champagne-soaked hospitality that became a symbol of Green’s status, was already being pegged back by the beginning of this year.While few tears have been shed for Green, the decline of Topshop illustrates another shift in fashion: the end of a golden age of the high street. From the early 00s to the beginning of this decade, Topshop was the poster child for a fashion culture in which glamour and newness were democratised and made available to shoppers on a mass budget for the first time. Catwalk images had previously been a closely guarded secret in the months during which clothes shown at fashion week went into production, which meant high street retailers operated on a six-month time lag, unable to begin work on high street versions of the “new look” until the designer clothes went on sale.The internet changed all that. Images became immediately available, enabling savvy high street teams to interpret the trends and deliver them to suit their customers just as fast as Bond Street. Topshop – thanks to a talented and largely female team led by Jane Shepherdson – exploited this opportunity better than anyone else, delivering up to the minute, well-priced fashion.Green’s heavily stage-managed front row photo opportunities signified more than just the roarings of his rampant ego. Having Vogue cover girls attend a Topshop fashion show reflected a time when fashion’s class system appeared to have melted away.It was not to last. The latest hemlines, as decreed by the most chic designers in Paris or the colour-dominating catwalks in Milan, had once been thrilling plot twists that kept fashion customers hooked. Now that all of fashion’s secrets were out in the open, these plot twists – otherwise known as trends – lost their power over women’s shopping habits.Topshop’s cachet had been based on being the closest a high street shopper could get to catwalk fashion. But in making it accessible to all, Topshop helped devalue the currency of biannual trends, and the audience ebbed away to find excitement elsewhere – in street style, streetwear, or Instagram, in a new generation of social media-oriented brands.At the same time, a growing awareness of the conditions of workers producing fast fashion and of the environmental impact of throwaway styles dimmed the lustre of fashion as a playground for all. The current crisis has been brought about by a man of whom few are fond, but in its pomp Topshop was a shop millions of women adored."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebcad221a6d54bd6f37104a9012f904f7352c49e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b1ad3d6877015b242bb6fa843e2ea86","title":"work it out 10 of the best sweatshirts for men in pictures","story":"Whether you are hitting the gym or not moving from the sofa, a sweatshirt is the go-to piece of kit*Prices correct at time of publication"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8f26e43cdc7055b2587cb3d11f8166f8fce7711/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=301a89b47a85081733b0ef3a436f228e","title":"how to get better at healthy eating shake up your shopping and start cooking","story":"Forget the takeaways, the meals out – and all those overambitious cookbooksThe simplest way to improve your diet and eat more healthily isn’t counting calories, “eating a rainbow”, buying low-fat everything or following any other of the tired, ineffective mantras that are trotted out. In practical terms, the surest way to eat better is cooking most of your food at home or, failing that, talking some other nice person into doing it for you. The more you eat out or rely on convenience food, the more the balance of your diet will go the wrong way. The more food you eat that isn’t homemade, the poorer your diet is likely to be in terms of nutrition and the quality and provenance of its ingredients. If you base your meals on mainly unprocessed or minimally processed ingredients, and cook more often than not, you won’t go far wrong.Motivate yourself for more hands-on activity in the kitchen by calculating how much money you’ll save. It’s easy to spend £20 a week on barely satisfying sandwich-based lunches. The most basic, most functional restaurant meals or takeaways will make an even greater dent in your finances. Kick the habit of reaching for the phone or dropping into the takeaway when you’re hungry and head for the kitchen instead. You’ll free up more money than smokers do when they give up fags.Shake up your shopping habits. Don’t leave thinking about meals to the last minute. Most of all, avoid ending up in the corner supermarket after work, desperately looking for something that you can eat asap. Smaller supermarkets that cater for the lunchtime and post-work trade stock even more junky snacks and assorted products to be avoided than their bigger equivalents. And they offer a stultifying choice that doesn’t change 365 days of the year, which kills the urge to cook. Make a slot for food shopping, and get yourself down to interesting small shops, markets or anywhere the seasons are reflected in what’s on offer and the food isn’t smothered in antiseptic plastic. These environments will make you want to eat, and ideas of what to cook will smack you between the eyes. If you can’t make it to stimulating shops, get a box of high-quality ingredients delivered to your home or work and let the contents inspire you.Initially, because it takes momentum to get into the routine of food preparation, don’t try to cook things you haven’t made before. Forget those dishes you meant to try but never got round to – that approach courts lethargy and self-delusion. Instead, revisit the old favourite recipes in your comfort zone, and remind yourself how much better they are than most of what you could buy eating out. Once you have got into a rhythm, start tackling recipes you have eyed up from afar. You might actually make some of them now.Cookbooks are great, but less is more, especially if you are one of those people who’s better at buying them than cooking from them. Focus on one favourite book that is well within your skill set, one with short ingredient lists, and cook the easiest dishes you can find in it. Once you’re in the swing of regular meal preparation, then, and only then, add new techniques and cuisines – fermentation, sourdough bread baking, Kazakh cookery et al – to your core competencies. Never believe that watching TV cookery programmes is more likely to make you cook. Empirical observation of UK eating habits suggests that the opposite is the case.Instead of trying to cook every day, most fatally in the early evening when you are already knackered, have a major once-a-week cooking session, probably at the weekend, that will break the back of your food preparation burden. Hero dishes here include soups, stews, casseroles, gratins, hefty salads, curries – anything that can be reheated or eaten cold, and served again for packed lunch or dinner in the week. Think in terms of a rolling programme. Last night’s spinach and potato curry becomes tomorrow’s side veg with sausages. Leftover roasted veg, with a bit of cheese crumbled on top, becomes the next day’s workplace salad lunch. Cook once, then eat twice or thrice. Make your dishes in bulk, freeze what’s left, and build up a store of homemade food for days when cooking seems too hard.Don’t let appetite-crushing “healthy eating” guidelines and assorted food scares overrule your good sense about what to eat, or spoil your enjoyment of food. Base your diet around sound ingredients, studiously ignore fads, and reserve a healthy scepticism for everything from top-down government health orthodoxy to the latest trendy diet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f5c27c5f61874b0ae2a69867bfa0cdf44688ca2/0_2206_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=278f6a78aec392f9d9acc00e1bf06231","title":"nigel slater chicken schnitzel recipe","story":"Chicken breasts in a tasty breadcrumb coatCut 2 medium-sized leeks into 2cm-thick rounds.

They did so a little gingerly but ended an afternoon freewheeling past Fulham feeling buoyed by the restorative power of points and goals.Last week’s slips at Brighton and, more punishingly, Liverpool came as a large dollop of reality for a club whose path to a new post-Wenger way was always likely to be a bumpy one. A reaction was needed – both from Unai Emery and from his players.The Premier League’s original Tinkerman, Claudio Ranieri, knows all about the benefits and perils of high-intensity squad juggling and it will not have gone unnoticed how Emery has attacked this project with a penchant for impatiently shuffling his pack before and during games. The search for his most balanced side is an ongoing one, not helped by the vulnerabilities in defence that are so hard to cure with relentless injuries in that department.But for all the angst about Arsenal’s goals conceded column, goal creation and execution also needed attention, having dipped of late. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette were granted a rare start side by side (something they experienced only once in 10 games before this fixture). It is one of Arsenal’s enduring curiosities that both Emery and his predecessor showed reluctance to play their two strongest attackers as a pair. Both had opportunities. Both got on the scoresheet. For all that it might feel risky for Arsenal to start two strikers, it does seem riskier not to.Emery pondered it afterwards and touched upon the big balance question. That was something Ranieri also had in his mind. Fulham brought a sense of adventure, even if marrying that to defensive stability was not easy. They carved out two fantastic chances for the speedy Ryan Sessegnon in the first half. Aleksandar Mitrovic’s hulking presence was another menace as defenders bounced off him and Bernd Leno had to be alert to keep out a couple of his headers.Just as Arsenal were feeling the pressure they pulled themselves together to score. Sead Kolasinac and Alex Iwobi combined all afternoon and when the ball was floated in Granit Xhaka was unmarked with enough time to chest the ball down and pass it into the net.Arsenal chances came regularly and they got a cushion early in the second half. Iwobi was involved, creating the space for a spate of quickfire passing involving Aubameyang and Kolasinac, and Lacazette was on hand to smash the ball in.Lacazette was disappointed not to be awarded a penalty when Jean Michaël Seri caught him with an outstretched leg as he burst forwards in the box. Nothing was given by the referee, Graham Scott. Seri was instrumental in Fulham cutting the deficit moments later. He bundled over Lucas Torreira and advanced to play a key role in the move that ended with Sessegnon crossing for the substitute Aboubakar Kamara to tap in.The Fulham bench was all smiles this time after the weekend penalty brouhaha. “I have no grudge,” Ranieri explained. “He apologised immediately to me, his teammates, the club and it is finished there. I need all my players. I kill but after I give oxygen to them.”The mood lurched. Briefly Fulham attacked at will and Arsenal’s anxiety gnawed. The air of discontent took a notable turn as the substitution of Lacazette for Aaron Ramsey was greeted by boos – the first time Arsenal supporters aired an audible challenge to Emery. “You need a cold mind to make a decision,” he said. “Every supporter can have a different opinion but I need to do my work.” It was not such a bad change after all, as the Welshman eased some nerves by scoring Arsenal’s third on the rebound after Aubameyang struck a post.It looked like one of those days for Arsenal’s top scorer, who went close a handful of times, but his goal came eventually, albeit aided by a deflection. He went over to the bench to celebrate with Lacazette. The Arsenal hierarchy, and where certain players fit into it, remains an intriguing conundrum in the Emery era. Again Mesut Özil was absent and the Ramsey situation – with his contract running down while he continues to contribute – adds to the complicated strands that need tidying up.The prospect of any arrivals to bolster that department is difficult but open. “The club is working, watching different possibilities,” Emery said. “Maybe we can if the transfer market gives an opportunity to sign one or two players.”Ranieri is also on the hunt for reinforcements and refinement. “My defence improved a lot but, when you play against these type of players that are fast, skilled, that is where you have to improve more,” he said. “They have to be faster. If there will be an opportunity for us I am sure our chairman will help us to stay in the Premier League.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bad99a27e45718405c81e1cc947ed2660a9de8cd/131_132_2157_1294/master/2157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80158ec71ee0c0ce12caeafbc406e7fb","title":"everton leicester city premier league match report","story":"Claude Puel was supposedly the manager under pressure at Goodison Park yet Leicester City appear in rude health compared with Everton under Marco Silva. A fifth defeat in eight matches, inflicted by Jamie Vardy’s clinical finish plus a dreadful home display, meant the new year arrived with a new low for the Everton manager. He needs fresh ideas, not only a new striker, to halt the slide.Everton were booed off as Leicester savoured a third win in four matches and a rise to seventh in the Premier League. The visitors were poor too, in truth, but able to execute their gameplan to frustrate and punish any mistakes. Silva’s team offered plenty, Michael Keane’s the one that led to Vardy’s winner, as their winter regression deepened. Everton have won once since November, not kept a clean sheet in eight games and have the same points tally as at the equivalent stage of the last forgettable season. They were clueless here.“We were too nervous and anxious without reason,” Silva said. “We are playing a lot of games in a row with no time to rest but that is not an excuse when you miss simple things like passing the ball. When you play in this way with easy mistakes, bad things come to you and that is what happened with the goal we conceded. We gave them the chance to do what they came here to do.”An early kick-off on New Year’s Day brought predictably meagre fare. The atmosphere was akin to a bad hangover, with an occasional groan breaking the silence, and the performance of both teams did little to lift it. The first half in particular was littered with basic errors, although Everton did create what few opportunities arose before the break.Jonny Evans blocked a shot from the otherwise subdued Richarlison and Jonjoe Kenny, one of the few pluses for Silva in place of Séamus Coleman, struck a post after connecting cleanly with Lucas Digne’s low cross through the Leicester penalty area. The full-back also set up Dominic Calvert-Lewin for a powerful header that flashed wide of Kasper Schmeichel’s goal.Leicester threatened even less in the first half, despite receiving several invitations by the hosts’ careless distribution. A tame header from Evans was all that concerned Jordan Pickford in the Everton goal and Puel sought improvement by replacing Rachid Ghezzal with Marc Albrighton during the interval. Predictably, given the nature of a dire game, it was a mistake that provided the visitors with a cutting edge and not a change in personnel.The breakthrough stemmed from a Schmeichel clearance that skimmed off Theo Walcott’s head and dropped to Keane midway in the Everton half. Under no pressure the central defender produced a terrible first touch and conceded possession to Ricardo Pereira. Quality then made its belated appearance at Goodison. The Portuguese right-back, stationed on the left wing by Puel, sent Vardy through on goal with a perfectly weighted pass. The striker took full advantage of his only chance of the game with a low shot into the far corner.Silva brought on Bernard and Cenk Tosun in an attempt to restore parity but, one shot and one header by the latter aside, Everton remained lethargic, unimaginative and lightweight. They could have been punished further when Vardy broke from another Keane mistake and the defender escaped a handball claim inside the area. Harry Maguire also volleyed over a Ben Chilwell free-kick from only three yards out. His blushes were spared somewhat by an offside flag but that call was wrong too.Asked about speculation over his position at Leicester afterwards, Puel replied: “That is not my concern. The most important thing is to show our quality as a team and a club. I am just a person who serves the club and I would like to continue to help the team and the players."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af8c90e9689c334dc28fde55d9e7ae44035cc473/223_207_2656_1593/master/2656.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32e88925ba9a4cd1debfdf72950c4e78","title":"nottingham forest leeds united championship match report","story":"Aitor Karanka said that Nottingham Forest’s 4-2 victory over Leeds was payback to the fans who offered him their vocal support on a dramatic day at the City Ground.The Spaniard went into the game against the Championship leaders under some pressure following a run of five games without a win. But Forest came back from 2-1 down to claim three precious points in spectacular fashion, against a Leeds side who had been reduced to 10 men following the sending-off of Kalvin Phillips in the 42nd minute.Jack Colback struck first for the hosts but the half-time substitute Jack Clarke and Gjanni Alioski scored to put Marcelo Bielsa’s side ahead. Forest responded by scoring three times in seven minutes as Colback got his second before Daryl Murphy and Ben Osborn secured a timely victory.“The only thing I can do is my best to try to convince this group of players that we can do something nice.“I think it is a big result for the team. Because the team deserved to win a game like this.“It was unfair that we had been in the kind of run we had been, without a win. In the five games where we had not won, we had played well.“Against Preston, Derby and Norwich we played well. This performance was a reflection of how good this team is. This can be a turning point for the confidence of the players. When they are able to play in this way, when they have problems with injuries and you have a lot of games – the team spirit they showed was amazing.”The Leeds head coach Bielsa denied that they might have been more cautious in their approach, after taking the lead.“We didn’t lose the control of the game. I would say the opposite, that we could control the game even if we had one player less,” he said.“If you analyse the way the opponent scored the goals, they are not avoidable goals. That’s why I don’t think that we were not cautious enough. They were just counter actions that we could have avoided but they are not defining any actions.“We had a succession of facts and all of these facts were against us.“We had to play with one player less. We were a little bit fragile in defence but during the 90 minutes we did everything to win. The players did a very big effort.“It’s not a new fact that we have problems on set-pieces and it’s also not a new fact that we make it easier sometimes for the opponent to have chances to score.“But the game has these kind of risks and the fact that we dared to play, sometimes it has negative aspects like today but it also gave us a style of play that we should be faithful to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abf3b9e96e7dbb226ed392217c42aa488027bb2a/0_180_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3defc2856ba038c5199ba537a630bc41","title":"arsenal fulham nottingham forest leeds and more clockwatch live","story":"Arsenal beat Fulham and the Championship’s top three all slipped up on a packed afternoon of New Year’s Day actionAnd with that I’m going to take my leave.

But their first chance, they scored because we made mistakes in the middle of the box. Second half, again mistakes. After we reopened the match, and created another two chances to draw the match.

Jamal Lowe netted his third goal in two games with an eighth-minute opener for the hosts but his effort was cancelled out by Kwesi Appiah 15 minutes from time to threaten a shock result. However, Ronan Curtis headed Pompey back in front five minutes later and they held on for maximum points as the visitors dropped to the bottom of the table. Second-placed Luton were held in a goalless draw at home to Barnsley, who remain fourth as a result. Sunderland top scorer Josh Maja fired Aiden McGeady’s assist into the bottom corner midway through the first half to hand his side a 1-0 win at Blackpool to strengthen their hold on third. Lee Novak netted a brace as high-flying Peterborough suffered a shock 2-0 defeat against lowly Scunthorpe and slipped out of the play-off places as a result, while the Iron remain in the relegation zone on goal difference. John Marquis scored twice to make it 18 goals for the season as Doncaster moved into the play-offs thanks to a comprehensive 5-0 victory at home to Rochdale. Alfie May headed the hosts ahead in the opening minute, while Ali Crawford doubled their tally midway through the first half before Marquis netted either side of half-time and James Coppinger’s late header added the gloss. Bradford made it four wins from their last five league games to move up to 20th following a comfortable 3-0 victory at home to 10-man Accrington. Lewis O’Brien opened the scoring as he fired Eoin Doyle’s assist into the top corner from outside the 18-yard box before the latter added a second on the half-hour for his fourth goal in five games. That second goal came moments after Offrande Zanzala was sent off for the away side, while Connor Wood scored a third just after the break to seal the win. Charlton edged Walsall 2-1 thanks to Karlan Ahearne-Grant’s 12th goal this term just six minutes in and Lyle Taylor’s ninth-minute penalty, while Andy Cook reduced the deficit two minutes into the second half. Plymouth moved off the bottom thanks to a 3-0 win over Oxford with Antoni Sarcevic on target after nine minutes before Ruben Lameiras added a brace.

Murphy, on the halfway line, is played down the left, he passes infield to Ben Osborn and he does just fantastically to take it past Forshaw with a fabulous first touch with his left foot, before sending a right-foot shot across goal and into the top corner!The intrigue at Arsenal is that Ramsey had come on just a couple of minutes before that goal, replacing Lacazette.

Enough now. Stop. Have some pity.Nottingham Forest equalise! It’s a corner from the left, headed into the air at the near post by a Leeds player, headed down at the far post by a Forest player, and it drops to Colback, 15 yards from goal, who lashes it in first-time!Plymouth are now 3-0 up at home to Oxford, and Ruben Lameiras has scored his second goal of the day!Ten-man Leeds have taken the lead! The ball is chipped into the area from the right, volleyed back across goal from beyond the far post, and Ezgjan Alioski smashes in a close-range volley! It’s Nottingham Forest 1-2 Leeds!Now they have scored! It’s a fine build-up that ends with the ball driven low across the area and Kamara, just on as a sub, scoring at the far post!Fulham should have scored! Again! This time Mitrovic meets a cross from the right and, six yards from goal, heads low but straight at the keeper!Hull are 4-0 up against Bolton. There are backheels in the build-up and everything, carnival football to see in the new year. Chris Martin caps a smart exchange of passes with a goal.Oooh! Roofe comes close to giving 10-man Leeds the lead at Nottingham Forest, running onto a long pass, controlling brilliantly as Pantilimon runs out, and then lifting over the keeper but wide of goal!Hull have made it 3-0 now, Kamil Grosicki scoring his second goal of the afternoon with a low drive.Another penalty, this at Blackburn where Jay Rodriguez has scored from the spot to bring West Brom back into the match at 2-1.Hull are surely on their way to a fifth successive victory, Evandro putting them 2-0 up at home to Bolton.In further equalising news, Millwall have made it 1-1 at Ipswich, Shane Ferguson sending the goalkeeper the wrong way from the spot.Middlesbrough have equalised at Derby, and QPR have gone 2-1 up at Aston Villa, Eberechi Eze finishing excellently when found just inside the area by a pull-back from the right!Ten-man Leeds equalise at Nottingham Forest!

Enjoy the remainder of your New Year’s Day. We’ll be back tomorrow with coverage of the Wednesday games. Cheers for reading!Ben Fisher was at the Cardiff City Stadium. Here’s his match report from there:Here’s the updated league table. Spurs almost certainly won’t win the league, but they’re six points behind Liverpool and if Manchester City win on Thursday then we’ll at least have a proper title race. Cardiff could be back into the bottom three if results go against them tomorrow. Well, that was pretty straightforward for Spurs. The game was basically over by the 12th minute, when Eriksen made things 2-0, and finished off by Son 14 minutes later. You could say that Cardiff didn’t turn up and Neil Warnock is likely to be pretty miffed by the whole thing, but this may well have just been one of those games where the better collection of players won. 90 mins + 2: Big diagonal from Sissoko finds Rose, who bombs forward like Spurs desperately need a goal. The ball finds its way to Kane on the edge of the box, he twists hither and thither looking for some space, which he finds and shoots left-footed, but it goes a bit too high and a bit too wide. 90 mins + 1: Mendez-Laing tries a cross from the right, finds Morrison but his header goes wide. 90 mins: Three minutes of added time to come. 89 mins: Sissoko drives down the right and is slipped in by Kane. The Frenchman tip-toes his way into the area, weighs up the passing options then shoots, but sends it way over the bar. 86 mins: Well look who we have here: it’s big Fernando Llorente, earning himself some appearance money by replacing Alli for the last few minutes. 85 mins: “Did you know that Son’s \u0026amp Etheridge’s national sides (South Korea \u0026amp The Philippines) are in the same group in the Asian Cup?” writes David Spurr. I did not know that actually, but they won’t actually face each other - Etheridge has been left out of the Philippines squad by your pal and mine Sven Goran Eriksson so he can concentrate on his Cardiff duties. 83 mins: Hoilett tries a hugely ambitious shot from way out, but is sails over. Spurs then attack after some hairy passing in their own box, Alli finds Eriksen with a fine through-ball, Eriksen then in turn plays in Kane but he tries to take it round Etheridge with no joy. Kane went down, with no hope of actually winning a penalty, and he might have been lucky to get away without a telling offbooking for a e. 82 mins: Gunnarson drives into the box from the right, he challenges with Skipp and both men take a handful of the other’s shirt. Gunnarson goes down and half-expects a penalty, but at the very least wants a corner after Alli put the ball behind. But no, goal-kick apparently. 80 mins: Cardiff in the wars: Gunnarson and Bamba both go down separately requiring treatment, but both look like they’ll be OK to carry on. 79 mins: Alli takes a touch so delightful that, if you could award goals during games based only on aesthetics, would almost be worth a hat-trick. Eriksen skimmed a pass from deep out to Alli on the left, and he flicks it first time, with the outside of his right foot, inside and past Manga. He takes a little too long over the shot and it’s blocked, but by golly that was lovely. 77 mins: “Do you think the lack of subs thing relates to Spurs’ main problem in any title challenge?” writes Adam Hirst, who I should say sent his email before they actually did make a change. “They’re good for the first team but nowhere near the others for the quality of the squad members. That’s why they didn’t rotate for the Wolves game and suffered for it.”76 mins: Change for Spurs, as Oliver Skipp replaces Son. 72 mins: Before that corner is taken, Cardiff take off Bobby Decordova Reid and replace him with Nathaniel Mendez-Laing. After it’s taken, Morrison rises and heads into the six yard box, Gunnarson attempts to help it on with his head, misses, but still forces Lloris into a save after the ball slides off his back. What an enjoyably comical goal that would have been. 71 mins: Basically all of Cardiff’s threat in the second-half has come from the left and Hoilett: he jinks down the flank and crosses, which he mishits but Lloris still has to palm the ball over the bar, lest he let a flukey one in. 69 mins: Quite surprising that Spurs haven’t made some changes by now. Most of the key men will get a rest for the FA Cup game against Tranmere, but in a season where they’re still playing in four competitions, every chance to have a breather should be taken. 67 mins: Rose feeds Kane in the box who is being so tightly marked by Manga the Cardiff man is basically in his shorts. Kane still manages to wiggle free enough to shoot, but Manga blocks it. 66 mins: Sensational then awful stuff from Bamba, who shimmies out of a tight situation with a Cruyff turn, only for his pass to be intercepted and set Son away. However, he gets the ball caught under his feet a bit and his shot, after a deflection, is saved by Etheridge. 64 mins: Kane again, and he has two shots this time after a low cross from Son. The second is blocked in the area by Bamba, speaking of whom...62 mins: Kane advances down the right channel and launches an ambitious ol’ shot from about 30 yards out. It goes not a million miles wide, but wide nonetheless. 61 mins: There’s Hoilett again, chasing Sanchez down and whipping the ball off his toes. However, he has to wait for support and when it arrives, his cross into the middle doesn’t beat the first man. 58 mins: Camarasa has sunk to the turf and seemingly decided that he can no longer continue. Not sure what the problem is but Joe Ralls will replace him. 55 mins: Hoilett has been sparky since coming on: he clips a cross to the back post from the left but it’s just too strong for any of the Cardiff attackers. Spurs counter at pace, but the crowd are delighted as Arter stops Kane with a hard but fair challenge, and then again as Gunnarsson muscles Alli out. 53 mins: Bamba takes Son out by treading heavily on his foot while trying to nip in front of him to take the ball, and looks absolutely mystified why a free-kick is given, so you can imagine his reaction after a yellow card is flashed. Entirely correct decision, though. 52 mins: Chance for Cardiff: Paterson drifts out to the right wing and his cross is deflected, bounces around the box and somehow finds its way to Hoilett at the back stick. He gets in front of Tripper and heads towards goal, but Lloris es to his right to save. 49 mins: Sky are trying to keep us all watching this one, but it’s optimistic. Obviously you should continue following this blog, though. What else are you going to do?48 mins: Sanchez goes to ground as if taken out by a grouse hunter with a shotgun, but at worst he was grazed by Reid as the Cardiff man slipped over. Curious little episode, that. 46 mins: We’re away again. Are we about to witness the comeback of the season? No, almost certainly not. The players are back out. Cardiff are making a change: Josh Murphy has been hooked, and Junior Hoilett is on in his stead. Too easy for Spurs. Cardiff are doing exactly what Neil Warnock told them not to, which is to allow a big team to trample all over them in the early stages and rendering the remainder of the game entirely pointless. After the Manchester United game the other week Warnock said Cardiff were lucky not to lose by seven or eight: looks similar this time. 44 mins: Spurs winding down the half by keeping the ball for a long spell. You’d imagine they’ll do this for most of the second-half too. 41 mins: Cardiff get a free-kick out on the left which Camarasa booms over to the back post looking for Paterson, but again a defender (Alli, this time) gets in front of him to head away. On Sky Alan Smith, who would know about these things, reckons Paterson isn’t attacking these headers with enough gusto and decisiveness. It is worth remembering that Paterson is still learning the centre-forward game in the Premier League, which is a bit like learning to fly in an A380.39 mins: Spurs have a corner from the right which is half-cleared by Cardiff, and they then win a free-kick after Sanchez barges Cunningham to the floor. On the touchline, Warnock already looks like a manager thinking about other things. 38 mins: Here’s Jeremy Dresner again: “Spurs can still challenge themselves by bringing on the Skipps of the squad and seeing if those players can hold and slow down a game second half.”You’d think that if managers were allowed to make 11 subs, Pochettino would do exactly that at the break. 37 mins: Kane lays one off to Alli but the midfielder can’t collect it properly. 34 mins: Football is a team game, the sum of inidual abilities rarely actually directly translating to how a match pans out. This, however, looks like Champions League quality players beating Championship ones. 32 mins: Warnock will presumably be spitting feathers at this - not so much that they’re losing, more that they’re doing exactly what he warned them not to do, which was to essentially surrender the game in the early stages. They try to get back into things with a corner, but Camarasa’s delivery is dreadful.

Here are your stories and picturesAfter a classic London renting situation, where my partner and I had to live with a leak just above the bed for a month, we finally got the savings together to get a shoebox of our own. No leaks yet, thankfully. It was on the first or second day, while we were eating on the floor over a sheet (with a bit of wine in tumblers), and were laughing and looking out of the window, surrounded by an endless pile of boxes and bags, that I felt a sense of calm I had never experienced before.Lying on my swing seat in my garden, the sun shining and a gentle breeze through the leaves of the birch tree above me. My swing seat was the best purchase I ever made: I’m on holiday whenever I sit on it. Whatever my mood, it answers to it, whether I’m happy or sad, elated or exhausted, with friends or on my own, for breakfast, dinner, lunch or tea. It is the best thing.In the middle of a small barn, in May 2012 at the end of 48 hours of lambing, while sitting on a low hay bale the only human in a barn full of sheep. I am no farmer, and in that barn I was no more than a nursery maid. Sheep mums being mums and lambs being lambs. The nursery had a rhythm: when the skipping and eating stopped, there was a calm that absorbed me. At that moment, life was good, and I was a part of it. I was one of the flock.Social media has some great benefits, but it can easily become mentally and emotionally burdensome. So, when we went to Havana in Cuba we made the decision to stay in a casa particular, essentially a private home, that had no access to the internet, a phone signal or any of the other trappings of modern life. For two days, in a small farming town called Viñales, we truly switched off. In the months since, I have deleted my Facebook account, closed email accounts and use my phone only for keeping in contact with close family and friends.In the minute after my second daughter’s head had crowned. The midwives were chatting, laughing and taking care of everything. It would soon be just me and my baby, in a secluded newborn ward, where I could just breathe and see the changing light through the window. No criticisms, no complaints, no office politics, no prioritising other people’s moods, no factoring in bills to pay, no existing for others. Only this most real thing that we were still doing together. This was the start of our conversation, the one that will continue all our lives.Sitting on Pentire Head, near Polzeath, north Cornwall, on a sunny October day in 2013. Tucked out of the wind, feeling the sun on my face and listening to the waves crashing against the cliffs below. The sea was almost turquoise and I felt a moment of complete calm all was well with the world.In July 2016, I tagged along for a day on my friend Ralph’s fishing boat, hauling lobster and crab pots for him around the Eastern Isles of the Isles of Scilly. The best bit was halfway through the day, when we were sitting there on the water in the sun, a mile out to sea, eating our cheese and pickle sandwiches, drinking a flask of tea, and lobbing the crusts and the odd bit of crab bait to curious fulmars that had joined us. Marvellous.An afternoon in hospital in Montélimar in 2009, after having had all four wisdom teeth removed. They had been growing horizontally and should have come out when I was a teen. One day, at 40 years old, with my first ever real toothache, I was told by a dentist that they had to come out straight away. I was waking up from the anaesthetic and staring out of the window at the intense blue sky, watching huge clouds of steam floating up from the nearby nuclear power station. I am self-employed with two children, and moments like that are incredibly rare. For once, I was without a care in the world.I had been having relationship difficulties for some years, and one day snuck away to visit my daughter at university. It was the first time in a long time that I felt free. I didn’t have to watch what I said or did, as I knew my daughter loved me unconditionally. Every minute was precious: we talked, laughed, ate out, shopped and hugged. That day was my first taste of what our life could be if I had the courage to leave, which eventually I did.My first ever wild swim as an adult was September 2012 in a tarn in North Yorkshire, hunting for a friend’s lost mobile phone. However, I didn’t embrace the joys of intentional outdoor swimming until October 2017, and I’ve been addicted ever since. The impact of the water meant I could think of nothing else but what was happening to my body: the numbing of the fingers, the sense of needing to gulp air but attempting to slow myself down to regulate my breathing. The sense of foreboding that I woke up with that morning has gradually faded, and has been replaced with a sense of wonder at immersing myself in the elements.September 2016, lying on a sunlounger at night on the terrace of a hotel on a hill outside Fiskardo, Cephalonia, with my husband, Richard. Every night, we would sit there and look at the beautiful sky, with no light pollution, and watch the shooting stars. We did this for an hour, chatting or sometimes just staying silent. Sadly, Richard died suddenly from a heart attack the following April. Perhaps understandably, I haven’t felt as relaxed since as I did on that holiday.It was a bright, clear day in September in a sleepy part of northern France, and I had stopped with my family at a lake. The water was gloriously cold, and I felt alive. Treading water, I turned to look at my family on the empty beach, waving and laughing at me, and I felt absolute contentment at being somewhere so beautiful with the people I love most in the world. The sunlight created an almost perfect reflection of the surrounding arc of trees and I realised that I was miraculously happy.Being off-grid with no phone, no people, no food, books or noise (other than the occasional breeze and a few flies) in Rub’ al-Khali – AKA the Empty Quarter – one of the most beautiful, harsh and huge deserts in the world. Every year, I get dropped off deep in the desert and stay alone for three days, with enough water and shade to survive, and without any expectations on me or my time. There is no experience like it that has this level of silence and peace.Walking the Camino de Santiago in September to mark the end of four years of study. Two girlfriends and I walked the Camino Inglés, and the freedom from anything else other than the walk each day was incredibly liberating. Every morning, we convened at 8am, had breakfast and set off, walking steadily to our destination, pausing occasionally to take in different sights and appreciate the landscape as it unfolded before us. The feeling of release from our cares was amazing, and we are already planning our next walk, along the Portuguese coastal path.I recently started an oil-painting course. The first week was landscapes, and I spent three chilly hours in a field painting the view. It was the most relaxed and carefree I had felt in a long, long time. My painting was pretty dreadful, but it didn’t matter: I had tried something new and felt proud of myself.In October, I went on a school trip to the Turkish resort of Kusadasi. After a long day of studying, my friends and I were free for the night and went swimming together. Maybe it was the lack of adult supervision, the scent of the sea or the general comfort I had from being with my friends that made me feel so relaxed. We were as free as a bunch of 16-year-olds on a school trip could be, which isn’t much, but at least I felt as if I could do what I wanted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1c89f11af3afe8a290e8de9ff3c5ca574bb7b5d/0_0_4875_3089/master/4875.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=669fa1546ddb60cedb643674805e522c 480w","title":"is this the end of netflixs golden age","story":"The streaming pioneer is facing competition from content suppliers, not to mention Apple and AmazonThe streaming pioneer Netflix’s first mover advantage has taken it to nearly 150m global subscribers – but serious competition is now coming as traditional media companies and Silicon Valley rivals fight back.Disney, with the might of its super franchises from Marvel to Pixar and Star Wars, is set to join the fray with its own streaming service, Disney+. The world’s largest entertainment group is banking on its content clout to help make its relatively late entry into the market a success. The AT\u0026ampT-owned WarnerMedia is also prepping a service that will include content from HBO, Turner and the Warner Bros film studio. WarnerMedia has not been as combative as Disney in pulling content from Netflix. But Netflix’s willingness to pay $100m (£78m) to keep Friends for one more year – at which point WarnerMedia will have to decide whether to keep it exclusively for its own service – highlights the value of crowd-pulling content and the problems Netflix could face if media companies reassess their content strategies. Netflix previously paid $30m a year for Friends, which has proven one of its biggest hits globally.“Netflix is facing increased competition from some of its previous content suppliers,” said Richard Broughton, an analyst at Ampere Analysis. “Despite its major focus on original content the company is still hugely reliant on licensed content for subscribers and that carries risks.”Netflix will also be looking over its shoulder at Apple, which is widely expected to launch a global streaming service this year.Netflix built its reputation and audiences from expensive dramas, such as The Crown. It has recently started to focus on cheaper, yet popular, unscripted shows – snapping up the Channel 4 reality show The Circle to make it in multiple markets – with the Netflix CEO Reed Hastings highlighting the value of such fare. “Unscripted television has always been a hugely profitable sector,” says Lucas Green, head of content at Banijay Group, maker of shows including Survivor, Temptation Island and Wife Swap. “Drama has always got the headlines and red carpet treatment. Yet gameshows, quiz, reality TV, dating, baking and talent shows are highly returnable, faster to produce, more cost efficient and therefore lower risk. ”The company has been very bullish on the prospects of the Asia-Pacific region, particularly India. But Netflix’s pricing makes it a premium service compared with pay-TV and streaming rivals in many of these new markets and it may have to cut prices – meaning it will need more subscribers. Which rival will be the biggest threat to Netflix? Broughton reckons it is Amazon: “If I had to put my money somewhere it would have to be on Amazon. New players like Disney and WarnerMedia will need a lot of time and marketing to break into households, and who else will want to licence content to them? Amazon has the deepest pockets. Its catalogue is by far the largest, even if a lot of the content is quite old, and it has been exploring sports rights and other areas other players aren’t. ”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d272b80e3d728e8f8989318fc012fee6831ed98d/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa9ab1115183e9065c612528052d4c44","title":"what would you like us to cover in 2019 share your thoughts","story":"We want to know what you hope to make space for next year and what you would like to see us cover Last year we published a piece detailing readers’ hopes for 2018’s  coverage, from continuing the fight against fossil fuel disinvestment to “making space for all things vegan”.We now want to hear what you would like us to report on in 2019.

In 2019 she releases her fourth album which, judging by the excellent songs played to the , is sure to be another hit. But she also has a stack of ongoing extracurricular activities.Where has your head been at since the last album?I finished touring, moved to New York, and I was jaded, depleted of any artistic inspiration. I just started cooking, going to the dry cleaners, learning piano. New York doesn’t really have the same rock’n’roll scene it used to, and it was very lonely. I’d often book studios and there’d never be anyone else there. But it gave me a kind of freedom, because there was no one telling me to release an album. I wasn’t forcing myself to write pop songs about boys and relationships, which I used to be so obsessed with when I was younger.And you got engaged. Did you write about that?I have a terrible habit of analysing things to within an inch of their lives, so I didn’t want to overanalyse what I had with him – it’s something much more pure, and something I didn’t need to explain to myself in a song.But on one new song, Love I’m Given, maybe I was reflecting on how I finally felt I’d found this person that was loving me for the right reasons. I don’t think I ever got over being thrust into the spotlight, so I put on quite a tough exterior. I never had time to myself, and any time I did was in a hotel room somewhere – I’d probably had a few drinks, knocked myself out. I don’t know how I could have possibly given a good version of myself to anyone: friends, boyfriends, family. So I’m very grateful Caspar came along, because I feel like I was able to be myself again.What else did you write about?Flux is about thinking about the person who you almost ended up with – I’m a sucker for what could have been. Electricity is about a friend who had been cheated on quite cruelly for a couple of years. But I can’t help writing with empathy, trying to understand why a person has behaved the way they have. Somebody tried to write a song to damage me, and it was a really horrifying thing to go through. I found it really baffling, and just sad, that something that I’d built entirely by myself, my career, was somehow at risk. It had a huge effect on me. But I still didn’t feel the need to be angry – so maybe that’s a good thing.One of my motivations to have a bigger platform as a singer is so that I have more people to reach. Climate change has got to a critical point where we all need to be very active we need to compensate for what’s going on in certain political situations. I know that “celebrities shouldn’t get involved in politics”, but it’s something we have to act on now.

What I think is fair to say is that on that, as with other appointments, there was no process in which they came before a commission and it was explained to a prospective new peer what was involved in the job.”The former MEP and Labour junior minister became something of a poster child for Lords reform after it emerged he had claimed nearly £57,000 in allowances and expenses in a year, during which he spoke in the chamber just three times. In 2009 he was suspended from the Lords for six months for offering to amend a bill in exchange for money.A former Conservative council leader who was made a peer in 1998, he was jailed for nine months in 2011 for claiming almost £14,000 for overnight stays in London when he was not in the capital. Since then, he has spoken in the Lords five times, the last being in January 2016.Some argue that the patchy record of the Tory former minister – who spoke three times in 2018 – shows attendance is not everything. Lord Fowler notes that while Heseltine rarely contributed, when he did, “he made an extraordinarily good speech”, such as in recent Brexit debates.As Speaker, Fowler has led efforts to reduce numbers. The process, undertaken by consensus, involves encouraging peers to retire and limiting the number of new arrivals, and is already exceeding its targets.“I do think it is completely crazy that we have a system at the moment where the size of the House of Lords is totally open-ended,” Fowler said. “I know of no assembly in the western world, or any other world for that matter, where there isn’t a limit on the numbers. It isn’t a revolutionary thing to say.”After a Christmas break, the Lords will be braced for another potential round of to-ing and fro-ing over Brexit legislation, as amendments shuttle between the houses.In June this process resulted in the government making concessions on the power of MPs to shape Brexit, after a series of defeats in the upper house. However, Fowler downplayed the possible influence of the Lords: “It’s important that people don’t get over-excited about an amendment, because by the process of ping-pong it goes back, obviously, to the House of Commons.“Last time we were told we were destroying the legislation – we didn’t destroy it at all. All that the Lords did was say: ‘Will you think again on this particular question?’ The Commons did and came to the same conclusion.“It may be famous last words but I don’t think that it’s going to change the whole process itself. That process has got to be decided in the Commons.”Fowler was speaking from his large corner office in the Lords, formerly used by the lord chancellor, with double-height panelled walls and views directly on to the river Thames.It was, he said, something of a contrast to his debut as an MP in 1970. “It’s taken something like 50 years to get to an office like this. The first office I ever had, I shared it with Ken Clarke on one side, John Prescott on the other and Cyril Smith at the end. It was over Boots, the chemist. I’ve steadily come up the scale.”Leaning in the fireplace was a poster bearing the slogan “Aids: don’t die of ignorance”, a legacy of Fowler’s tenure as heath secretary, when the HIV crisis first gained prominence.Fowler, who has since become a celebrated champion of LGBT rights, briefly broke his political neutrality to say that equal marriage should be extended to Northern Ireland: “I think it should be a United Kingdom process. It shouldn’t be a matter of debate any more.”For all the advances on Aids – last month the Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle announced to the Commons that he was HIV positive but could live an entirely unaffected life – Fowler said it was a “total scandal” that almost a million people a year still died from the disease, mainly in poorer counties.“When I have finished with this job, it is one of the things that I intend to return to, for the years that are left, to campaign on that,” he said.Fowler also said some attitudes on HIV remained stuck in the past. “There has been a substantial change,” he said. “It hasn’t been total. I had the other day a peer who came up to me after a series of question before World Aids Day, and said: ‘You know, in my view it’s just all self-inflicted’. And you think: ‘Really?’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c66118b73b4941052c60408bfb1d8daf506fe86/0_1032_4931_2960/master/4931.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6c0702618bc864f91f964b912cc094b","title":"time for politicians to make stark choices over climate change","story":"MPs must show leadership on issues such as meat production and air travel, says Clive LewisPoliticians must persuade consumers to make dramatic lifestyle changes if devastating climate change and mass extinctions are to be averted, according to the shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis.From cutting back on red meat to taking fewer flights, the Norwich South MP said the public must face up to “real, stark choices” in the years ahead.“If you want your children and grandchildren to avoid food shortages, to avoid power shortages, to avoid biological degradation, bioersity loss – if you actually want a planet that’s inhabitable – then we need to make some choices together, now, and some of them are about quite dramatic changes to how we live,” Lewis said in an interview with the .Having returned to Labour’s frontbench a year ago, after resigning in protest when Jeremy Corbyn whipped MPs to support the triggering of article 50, Lewis was given the job of examining how a Labour government could champion sustainable economics. He has repeatedly made it clear he regards the issue as a test of political leadership.“I think there’s a crunch point now coming for politics. You often hear there’s no leadership in politics – and this isn’t a leadership pitch, I promise you – but when you talk about leadership, there’s leadership in different forms,” he said.On red meat, for example, Lewis said: “I’m not going to sit here and say, yeah, let’s ban red meat … but you can show leadership by asking, well actually, is it right that we publicly subsidise an industry that is contributing so much to greenhouse gas emissions, and often is a very unsustainable practice?”He said the government’s role should be to “encourage people and show leadership as to how we’re going to shift people’s eating habits on to a more sustainable footing”.On air travel, he said Labour was starting to come up with options, including a tax “escalator”, which would have the biggest impact on frequent fliers, who tend to be the wealthiest.In a wide-ranging interview, Lewis also mused about everything from the four-day week to universal basic income, and how to ensure the rapid technological innovation of the “fourth industrial revolution” benefits the wider public.While many such policies are at an early stage of development, Lewis said the next Labour manifesto should be significantly different to the previous one.“The 2017 manifesto gave a lot of people a kind of warm, cuddly glow, and it was a great reset of our values and where we are, but it was a base on which to build,” he said. “The next manifesto needs to be a radical manifesto, which builds on the reset, and is 21st-century socialism in action. There’s a hunger for that.”McDonnell has asked the former head of the civil service Bob Kerslake to examine how to rework the Treasury green book – the manual for government spending decisions.Lewis said he hoped environmental sustainability could be incorporated into Whitehall thinking as part of that review.“What we want to do is open out how the Treasury looks at spending and revenue, and looks in a longer term, more holistic and sustainable way – and that is radical.”Lewis recently secured £17,500 from inidual donors to fund his work on sustainable economics, giving him a measure of independence from the party machine.He argued that developing a more sustainable economic model could allow Britain to take a leadership role in the world after Brexit.“Leadership and punching above your weight doesn’t necessarily always have to mean gunboat diplomacy and bombing other countries into the stone age. It can actually mean leading by example, and helping other countries,” he said.Lewis was widely considered a rising star on the left of the party when he arrived in parliament in 2015, and was catapulted on to the frontbench by Corbyn, as many more experienced MPs refused to serve or were sent packing.But the former army reservist and TV reporter does not fit the mould of a career politician and has repeatedly charged headlong into controversy. In 2016, as shadow defence secretary, he clashed with Corbyn’s close aide Seumas Milne over last-minute changes to a party conference speech.In late 2017, he apologised after video footage emerged of him using the phrase “get on your knees, bitch” at a party conference fringe event, and was then suspended – and cleared – over accusations that he groped a party member.Most recently, Lewis was criticised after miming putting a gun in his mouth during a debate in the House of Commons as a Conservative MP interrupted his frontbench colleague Anneliese Dodds.Lewis, who postponed his wedding to defend a wafer-thin majority in the 2017 general election, and recently became a father for the first time, said he found the BBC documentary Blue Planet too unsettling to watch.“I couldn’t watch BP for a long time, until I started doing this job, because I knew in my heart that Blue Planet, as beautiful as it was, at the end they would always have the human impact, and I struggled to watch it because I felt so powerless,” he said.He said he believed countering the human threats to the environment would have to mean junking “the obsession with flat-screen TVs and consumption”.“On their deathbed, do people think: ‘I wish I’d spent more time with my Ferrari’? Or do they say: ‘I wish I’d spent more time watching my kids grow up, I wish I’d spent more time country walking’?“It’s about the things that matter in life, and how we have an economy that better reflects that,” he said.On Brexit, meanwhile, Lewis stuck rigidly to the party line, dismissing questions about what Labour would put in its manifesto if there were to be a snap general election as “hypothetical”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44f6f56570d90240a47d19f7e32713d2b3cdb5d2/72_0_5474_3285/master/5474.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b75cded9b59e22f4d8cb67199d196b4f","title":"new horizons heads for flyby of space rock ultima thule","story":"Scientists celebrate probe’s successful completion of most distant space flyby in historyNasa scientists are celebrating after a spacecraft “phoned home” to confirm it had successfully performed the most distant space flyby in history in the early hours of New Year’s Day.Thousands of photographs of the dark, icy space rock called Ultima Thule were snapped by the New Horizons probe as it barrelled past it on the outer edge of the solar system at 0533 GMT.After being out of contact for 10 hours, anxious staff at the mission’s control centre at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland broke out in applause on Tuesday after confirmation signals were received from the probe, which could have been seriously damaged by even the smallest particles.“We have a healthy spacecraft. We’ve just accomplished the most distant flyby,” said Alice Bowman, mission operations manager for New Horizons. “We are ready for Ultima Thule’s science transmission, science to help us understand the origins of our solar system.”Ultima Thule lies 4bn miles (6.5bn km) from Earth in the Kuiper belt, a band of dwarf planets, space rocks and icy debris left over from the formation of the solar system 4.6bn years ago. Because of the distance, scientists had to wait 10 hours to learn whether the flyby had been successful.From being a small dot only known in the form of a number of pixels, Ultima Thule will soon be viewed as an “entirely new world”, according to Nasa, as further images are beamed back. The first pictures are expected to be published later this week, but the full download of the data will take 20 months to complete.Alan Stern, principal investigator of the New Horizons mission, said images taken during the spacecraft’s approach suggested Ultima Thule is probably shaped like a bowling pin, with two bulbous ends. However, he said a possibility remained that it may be two separate objects locked in a tight orbit.New Horizons is so distant that mission scientists had no way of helping out with any last-minute glitches. Instead any final troubleshooting will have to have been handled by the probe’s onboard software.Jim Bridenstine, Nasa’s chief administrator, said in a tweeted statement: “In addition to being the first to explore Pluto, today New Horizons flew by the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft and became the first to directly explore an object that holds remnants from the birth of our solar system.“This is what leadership in space exploration is all about.”Hal Weaver, a research professor at Johns Hopkins University and a project scientist on the New Horizons mission, called the flyby a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity”.“This is another great step in the exploration of our solar system,” he said.In 2015, New Horizons flew past Pluto and captured a stunning series of photographs of the dwarf planet’s surface. The images revealed Pluto to be a world where nitrogen mountains tower above the ground and volcano eruptions discharge ice into a thin hydrocarbon atmosphere.After the Pluto encounter, Stern asked Brian May, the Queen guitarist and astrophysicist, if he would compose a track to celebrate the Ultima Thule flyby.“I did scratch my head for a while,” said May. “The name is quite hard to conjure with. But then it came to me that this is about man’s desire to reach out into the universe and explore, and see things that have never been seen before.”The New Horizons track, May’s first solo single for two decades, included a message from Stephen Hawking and was premiered at the control centre shortly before the flyby. “It’s been very exciting. I feel like I’m on that thing,” May said. “To me, it’s about the human spirit and reaching out to discover where we are and why we are here.”Little is known about Ultima Thule, or 2014 MU69, to use its official name. But based on preliminary observations, scientists think it may resemble a giant peanut with two large lobes fused together. The dark rock may contain frozen carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, molecular nitrogen and methane, which may be exposed by impact craters on the surface.While some comets that streak through the solar system are thought to have originated in the Kuiper belt, space rocks as distant as Ultima Thule have remained on the outer edges of the solar system since birth. For this reason it is thought that objects such as Ultima Thule, the so-called cold classical Kuiper belt objects, look the same today as they did at the dawn of the solar system.“We’ve never explored a body as primordial or as far away from the sun as Ultima Thule,” said Mohamed Ramy El Maarry, a New Horizons science team collaborator and lecturer at Birkbeck, University of London. “This gives us a chance to look at what comets are like before they enter the inner solar system. They’ve been in deep freeze since they formed 4.6bn years ago.”He added: “What’s really exciting is we expect to see surprises. We are really looking at the basic ingredients of the solar system. This can tell us a lot about the building blocks of the solar system, about the conditions when the solar system formed, and about other solar systems as well.”The first images to be beamed home from Ultima Thule will be small and grainy, but a day or two after the encounter, Nasa hopes to have more impressive pictures from the probe. “This is the first time we’ll fly past a cold classical Kuiper belt object and really see what it looks like,” said Weaver. “We’re taking our first steps into this whole new zone of the solar system. We’re on our way.”Bowman said: “We can build a spacecraft on Earth, and we send it out billions of miles away from Earth, and it sends us back all this wonderful data that we get to look at and learn more about our world, our solar system.“There’s a bit of all of us on that spacecraft that will just continue after we’re long gone here on Earth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17d718e06c7558f45b1df407e4b61ba14ad77a64/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa2f317b6f14a94c6bbe37d64993d2f0","title":"foundling museum london bedrooms exhibition highlights child poverty","story":"Bedrooms of London exhibition captures children’s spaces in bedsits and hostelsSome of them resemble cells while others are striking because of their lack of toys, space and privacy. All of them are children’s bedrooms, or at least the space they sleep in, exhibited in photographs displayed by the Foundling Museum, in London.More than 30 pictures by Katie Wilson expose the dispiritingly grim living conditions of families in poverty and form Bedrooms of London, an exhibition that could be one of the most challenging of 2019. “There is something very haunting about the images,” said Caro Howell, the director of the museum. “It is the absences, the absence of space for a child to walk in, or learn to walk in, or play in. The absence of toys, the absence of privacy. Because the people are not there, the environment is speaking for them, they are very haunting.”The photographs will be shown alongside first-hand narratives of the families. There is, for example, the tiny hostel bedsit of Amelie, a baby’s cot next to the mother’s sofabed and no room for the child to crawl then there is the story of Sainey, 32, who went to London aged 15 as a domestic slave, never left, and cannot work because she is in the country illegally and cannot afford clothes for her growing children.“Bedrooms are supposed to be a place of comfort and emotional safety and love,” said Howell. “A child’s bedroom is supposed to be a physical manifestation of the love that those surrounding it feel. Seeing the images brings you up short.”The project is the outcome of two years’ engagement with families by the the Childhood Trust, a London charity that is also producing a book and report to send to policymakers.The trust’s chief executive, Laurence Guinness, said some of the hostels in which people were forced to live were like open prisons. “It’s like you’re living in a cell. You can go out whenever you like but you’ve got no money to go and do anything. You can’t really escape, people are trapped.”When they set out on the project they assumed most children would have their own bedroom. “Even a child poverty charity can be naive about child poverty,” he said. “Those at the very bottom don’t even have a bedroom any more.”The exhibition will be at the museum which is dedicated to the history of the Foundling hospital, founded by Thomas Coram in 1739 as “a hospital for the maintenance and education of exposed and deserted young children”.Guinness said he hoped the photographs would be shown in parliament, where policymakers can take action.But while the families featured in the photographs were down, they were not out, he said. “We got them together recently to let people comment on the pictures and the report. They were very motivated to help.“The overriding question was: ‘How can this create any change?’ That’s all we’re interested in is change. We are not defeated yet.”• Bedrooms of London at the Foundling Museum, 8 February-5 May 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c12f3ac68a8355bf798551849d80918cc3ee297c/1286_141_2703_1622/master/2703.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adb84598d455b6157b5837f36ce8b4ad","title":"martha plimpton webchat sweat goonies","story":"The star of Sweat, The Goonies, Parenthood and The Good Wife joins us for a live webchat at 1pm GMT on Wednesday 9 JanuaryMartha Plimpton was just 14, and had already modelled for Calvin Klein, when she starred in her breakthrough film, the rollicking treasure hunt The Goonies.

The kiss was a peck by Clark on the forehead of Russell and it was another two years before the first mouth-to-mouth kiss, featuring Russell and Guido Smith, played by Nicholas Donovan, but both scenes were criticised at the time.The Sun called the soap “EastBenders” after the latter kiss and fumed about “a homosexual love scene between yuppie poofs … when millions of children were watching”. Questions were asked in parliament about the appropriateness of such scenes.Oates has previously credited those kisses, plus the first pre-watershed lesbian kiss, between Anna Friel and Nicola Stephenson on Brookside in 1994, as helping to change society.While times have changed, there were still more than 100 complaints when the show featured a kiss between Christian Clarke (John Partridge) and Lee Thompson (Carl Ferguson) in 2008.Oates discussed the prospect of a gay bar in a video on Twitter, responding to viewers’ questions. She said the show was committed to championing ersity by having a cast list that reflected “multicultural London”. To that end, she also announced there would be two new characters in the Ahmed family, Habiba and Iqra, plus the return of another BAME character, Mitch Baker, whose daughter Chantelle will also feature.Oates was credited with introducing storylines about difficult issues when she was a producer at Coronation Street, including grooming and male rape. They proved controversial with some but helped the soap attain its highest ratings in years.EastEnders’ New Year’s Eve episode featured Bernie Taylor (Clair Norris) telling her mother, Karen Taylor (Lorraine Stanley): “I think I’m in love ... with a girl.”Ironically, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and his “night tsar”, Amy Lamé, are battling the decline of LGBT bars in the capital."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19af921e0d1f352446a25f1bbd5f9fecd50c2e69/0_0_4075_2445/master/4075.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9df406b5b504cde7c157786d6bbb27cf","title":"us satellite imagery 2018 kilauea hurricane florence paradise","story":"From lava flows on Hawaii to raging fires in California, images gathered from high above Earth by satellites in 2018 show how humanity, geopolitics and the force of nature upended lives and landscape"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09959987445d9d2b3cc7418cd439e3613bfd4e47/45_122_762_457/master/762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f567e349601df369705fdde79fe7aa2","title":"us man detained in russia is former marine says family","story":"Paul Whelan was in Moscow for friend’s wedding when he was held for spying, says brotherThe American man who was detained in Russia on accusations of being a spy is a retired marine who was visiting Moscow to attend a wedding, according to his family.In a statement released on Tuesday morning, the family of Paul Whelan said the last time anyone had contact with him was on 28 December, the night before the wedding he was due to attend.Russia’s domestic security service announced on Monday that it had arrested an American on Friday who was “carrying out an act of espionage”. A statement in Russian did not provide further details about the inidual who was detained or information about the alleged spying, but his name appeared to translate as Paul Whelan.The US state department declined to comment on whether the detained inidual was a former marine, but in response to a question from the  it said it was aware that a US citizen had been detained, had been notified of his detention by the Russian ministry of foreign affairs, and said it was seeking access to the inidual.“Due to privacy considerations, we have no additional information to provide at this time,” the department said.In an email to the , Whelan’s twin brother, David, said Whelan was attending the wedding of a fellow former marine, who was marrying a Russian woman.Whelan’s family said he had been to Russia “numerous times”, as far back as 2007, and was currently working on a corporate security team for Borg Warner, which is listed online as a Michigan-based maker of automative industry components.David Whelan said his brother had previously been to Russia as a visitor and for his work for Kelly Services, a management consultancy. could not immediately verify the accuracy of the family’s statement.Whelan’s previous trips to Russia, his brother said, were only for short visits and he had limited Russian language abilities “other than to be able to get around”.“This visit was entirely for pleasure, from what I understand,” his brother said.The family said they had learn of Whelan’s arrest on Monday after reading the news reports.“We noticed that he was not in communication on the 28th, which was very much out of character for him even when he was traveling,” the family said. “We are deeply concerned for his safety and wellbeing. His innocence is undoubted and we trust that his rights will be respected.”It is not clear whether any US officials have seen Whelan since his arrest. The family said they had been in contact with their congressional representatives, the US embassy and the state epartment, where many officials were on furlough due to the US government shutdown.The family said they believed a 72-hour window for the US government to be able to visit Whelan had already started and they had not been in contact with anyone who had seen or been in contact with Whelan since 5pm (Moscow time) on 28 December.“We are hoping he will be able to return home soon,” the family said.The wedding party had been staying at the pol hotel in Moscow.Whelan’s arrest came just weeks after a Russian national named Maria Butina pleaded guilty to secretly acting as a Russian agent in the US. It is not clear whether Whelan’s detention was an attempt to retaliate for Butina’s arrest, which was a sore point in US-Russian relations."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Adrienne Cullen campaigned for a no gagging clause policy in hospitals across EuropeOngoing uncertainty of Brexit \u0026lsquodrains hope\u0026rsquo from society, says joint new year\u0026rsquos message\u0026lsquoSerious concern\u0026rsquo at sharp increase in the number of pedestrian deaths on roadsUnionist leaders remain united in their opposition to proposed Irish backstopJust one second separates babies born at Our Lady of Lourdes, Drogheda, and the Coombe\u0026lsquoThe logical time to reshuffle the Cabinet is after the Local and European elections\u0026rsquoGarda\u0026iacute arrest two men, aged 44 and 18, following the incidentMan discharged himself shortly after arriving at Connolly Hospital in BlanchardstownDesigner dogs can sell for more than \u0026euro36,000 each, Dogs Trust Ireland saysThousands attend Dublin\u0026rsquos New Year\u0026rsquos Eve festival with pyrotechnics and light showsMy Options will provide the names of GPs and hospitals offering abortion servicesVaradkar also signals intention to reshuffle Cabinet after local and European elections in MayMore than 10,000 people, including 3,000 children, granted Irish citizenship in 2018Missing from home since December 25th and today failed to attend Coombe hospital appointmentGrieving daughter Nadia pays tribute to mother and friend \u0026lsquoinspired by generosity\u0026rsquoHarris says 2019 legislative priority to make female contraception more widely availableDeparture comes several months prior to end of Bishop O\u0026rsquoReilly\u0026rsquos term as prelate"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3745469.1546368592!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"church leaders decry poverty and political vacuum in north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFood banks: The religious said that the “marked increase in people needing to avail of such facilities” is a worrying trend. File photograph: The Brexit, the increasing number of people in need of food parcels and the lack of a government in Northern Ireland “drains hope” from society, according to a joint new year message from church leaders. The message was signed by the leaders of the Catholic Church, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Methodist Church and the Church of Ireland as well as the Irish Council of Churches. It urged all political leaders “to make a difference and to bring a sense of hope”.The church leaders said the “ongoing uncertainty of Brexit has added to the worries, of businesspeople and ordinary citizens alike. Many businesses fear for the future, while many families, struggling to make ends meet today, are anxious about what that future might hold”.The religious leaders said “the lack of a functioning devolved government” in Northern Ireland, which has also has meant an ever increasing pressure on schools, hospitals, welfare system and many other aspects of society’s infrastructure. “As so often happens, it is the vulnerable and the marginalised that suffer most and they should be at the forefront of our thoughts and prayers as we enter into a new year,” said the leaders. While it was “a great encouragement to see the willingness of people” to contribute to initiatives such as food banks, the “marked increase in people needing to avail of such facilities” was a worrying trend. But they also said “there are also glimmers of hope” across Ireland. Neighbours were looking out for neighbours. Ordinary people, community and church groups were caring for those in need. “People of good intent are stepping up to the mark and giving positive leadership on the ground, working for the common good. In villages and towns across the island, political, church and community leaders are making a difference at a local level.“We were encouraged by the willingness of party leaders to meet with us last September, as we sought to provide a safe space to facilitate open discussion and mutual understanding. “A series of regional meetings is also under way, bringing together local politicians, community and church leaders to talk with one another, to build relationships and again to foster mutual understanding. Such initiatives, along with others, are being taken by different people of good will at local and regional level, and these can bring glimmers of hope. “For that we want to give thanks – it is always better to light a candle than simply curse the darkness” the message said. “May you know the blessing of the Lord in the year that lies ahead, ” concluded the message.Selected by picture editor Frank Miller"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3745489.1546370931!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il and sdlp on course for closer links","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil and SDLP leaders Micheál Martin and Colum Eastwood hope to start a project that will  “evolve” into a formal link-up of the two parties, according to sources. The Fianna Fáil and SDLP leaders Micheál Martin and Colum Eastwood hope to be in a position early this year, possibly later this month, to announce the start of a project calculated eventually to “evolve” into a formal link-up of the two parties, according to sources.Notwithstanding some nervousness and concerns, particularly within the SDLP, following Monday’s  report of a phased integration plan they said the project remained on course to go ahead.“It will be a process, not a big bang there will be no resiling from this,” said a senior Fianna Fáil source.The sources added that the process would happen over a number of phases with, initially, an announcement about co-operation between the parties and the development of agreed all-island policies.“Initially the focus will be on co-operation and partnership and electoral co-operation rather than any talk of a merger. This has to evolve. You can’t just take two political parties and immediately mash them together,” said a senior source.He added that ultimately the plan was for the integration of the two parties although as yet no definite timeframe for when this should happen has been agreed.“Everyone knows it has to happen. Once started it can’t be stopped, you can’t be half married,” he added.Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy said that the “merger of two partitionist parties would be a long overdue development”.However, sources repeated that it was unlikely that the two parties would be in a position to run candidates under a single SDLP-Fianna Fáil umbrella in the May local elections in Northern Ireland. And that instead SDLP candidates may stand with the “endorsement” of Fianna Fáil.However, there is potential for splintering as South Belfast Assembly member Claire Hanna has already expressed reservations.Belfast Cllr Tim Attwood, who is also on the Labour wing of the party, would have concerns while Lisburn SDLP Cllr Brian Heading also indicated he would have problems. In addition SDLP Youth stated it was “against any merger, working arrangement, etc with any party whose values and principles are contradictory to the values and principles of the SDLP”.Nonetheless, those behind the initiative are confident that a significant majority of the SDLP at Assembly and councillor level either support or would acquiesce to a developing relationship between the two parties. “Numerically the party is for it,” said an SDLP source.Sources said efforts would be made to “accommodate” some of those concerns while there also would be a concentration on maintaining the “brand and civil rights legacy” of the SDLP.The sources also emphasised that the tie-up between the two parties was predicated on Brexit and a changing political landscape on the island of Ireland rather than a “save the SDLP” enterprise.Mr Eastwood in a new year message made no direct reference to an evolving alliance between Fianna Fáil and his party, but did say that the SDLP was “ready to embrace change”.“Since our foundation the SDLP has led much of the political advancement that Ireland has experienced. We want to lead that change again. We are determined to ensure that we are in a position to do so,” he said.Labour leader Brendan Howlin repeated his party conference commitment in November to “step in” if the SDLP allied with Fianna Fáil. “What that means is that we will actively support our comrades in Northern Ireland to continue to put a social democratic option to the people at elections,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3745324.1546364621!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maeve is first irish baby of 2019 born seconds past midnight","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Maeve was born at three seconds past midnight on New Year’s Day, making her the first baby born in Ireland in 2019.

Photograph: AP French president Emmanuel Macron has called on the nation to unite and cease “hateful” attacks during protests.Mr Macron also called on people to avoid falling for “false information” online amid anti-government demonstrations that have increasingly turned violent.The president, went on the offensive in his televised new year’s speech. The counterattack comes amid deteriorating approval ratings which have plummeted in 2018 as he failed to shake the label “president of the rich” and faced an unprecedented citizens’ protest movementHe deliberately did not name the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement that has been demonstrating against the government at road blocks and weekly city centre protests for six weeks. But he criticised what he called a minority who, he said, claimed to be the voice of the people but were in fact “megaphones of a hateful crowd who have lashed out at elected politicians, security forces, journalists, Jews, foreigners, homosexuals”.Macron said this hatefulness was “the negation of France” and that “our future depends on our capacity to love each other and to love our nation”. He said he had “seen the unthinkable and heard the unacceptable” in recent weeks and that “order” in France would be maintained.Mr Macron spoke as more than 147,000 security forces were mobilised across the country for New Year’s Eve celebrations, not just because of the terrorist threat in France but also because authorities feared surprise demonstrations by anti-government protesters.About 300,000 tourists and revellers were expected on the Champs Elysees on New Year’s Eve for Paris’s annual light show, which is projected on to the Arc de Triomphe and was the target of protesters this month. A security cordon was set up around the area from 4pm and guards and police checked those who entered. Some gilets jaunes demonstrators called for peaceful protests in Paris.Over the past decade, hundreds of cars have been set alight on the edge of French cities including Strasbourg and Lyon on New Year’s Eve in what has become a kind of end-of-year ritual. But officials said security services were on alert for unannounced anti-government protests in order to prevent violence.The gilets jaunes movement, named after protesters’ hi-vis vests, began in November as a tax revolt against a new fuel duty. It has morphed into a nationwide protest against what has been seen as an unfair and unjust tax policy, and Mr Macron’s measures favouring businesses and the wealthy. Rioting, arson and running battles with police have occurred on the edge of demonstrations in Paris and other cities.In his new year speech, Mr Macron acknowledged the anger that had spread across France and tried to empathise. But he said it had been brewing for a long time – implying he did not accept the blame but instead laid responsibility on decades of mass unemployment and what he has called years of political stagnation.Mr Macron tried to channel the positivity of the anger, saying it “showed us that we’re not resigned to anything, that our country wants to build a better future”.He was careful to use the words “us” and “we” to avoid appearing cut off from the public mood. After he was mocked for the staid style of a recent televised speech aimed at calming the protests, which was delivered seated at a desk in a gilded room, this time Mr Macron stood up in a more modern room in the Elysee Palace.After some in Mr Macron’s shrinking supporter base feared he would step back from his manifesto promise of structural reforms because of the unrest, the president went on the offensive, vowing to press on with his plans to overhaul the social welfare state and social protection in 2019, beginning with changes to unemployment benefits.He said of his changes so far, including loosening of labour laws: “The results can’t be immediate, and impatience – which I share – can’t justify any kind of giving up.”He repeated his argument that unbridled, lawless “ultra free-market” capitalism was at its end, suggesting he wanted to reinvent a new form of responsible globalisation in a Europe that “protects”.Mr Macron said one of his key wishes for 2019 was “truth”, including a fight against inaccurate information online. This suggested that he might seek to go further on regulating information online, after his government passed a law which aims to empower judges to order the immediate removal of news deemed as fake during election campaigns. He did not give details.Gilets jaunes demonstrators have called for referendums and a greater role for citizens in everyday politics. Mr Macron said “our institutions must continue to evolve” but didn’t spell out any possible changes to the political system. He has promised to launch a national debate from January and said only that he would write to citizens to set out the parameters in coming days.The European elections in May will be a major test for Mr Macron’s political party, La Republique En Marche, which is behind Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally in the polls. Mr Macron said in his speech that he would soon set out a project for Europe.He is also again under pressure over the scandal of his former bodyguard and security aide, Alexandre Benalla, who was sacked this summer after he was filmed acting violently to demonstrators.The Benalla affair was back in the headlines this week over the former aide’s continuing use of diplomatic passports. He also claimed he had remained in personal contact with Mr Macron. The affair has proved damaging in part because of the Elysee’s botched handling of it, making statements that were contradicted and giving the impression of a cover-up. The Elysee on Monday dismissed his claims as invented. – "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3745402.1546364388!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"democrats hope to corner senate republicans over shutdown","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“Democrats are taking action to lead our country out of this mess,” Nancy Pelosi, above, and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement. Photograph: Erin SchaffThe New York TimesDemocrats in the US House of Representatives plan to vote on Thursday on a funding package to end the 10-day-old partial US government shutdown, without providing the $5 billion President Donald Trump has demanded for a US-Mexico border wall. The planned vote sets up a Democratic showdown with Trump’s fellow Republicans on an issue dear to the president on the first day of ided government in Washington since he took office in January 2017 with a Congress led by his own party. Democrats formally take control of the House from the Republicans after winning a majority of seats in November’s congressional elections. The two-part Democratic package filed on Monday in the House includes a Bill to keep funding for the Department of Homeland Security at current levels until February 8th with no new wall funding, as well as a bundle of six measures worth nearly $265 billion combined that would fund the other shuttered agencies through the September 30th end of the current fiscal year. The two parts will be voted on separately on the House floor on Thursday, said Democrats, who will hold a 36-seat majority. If approved in the House, the funding package would go to the Republican-led Senate. Its prospects there appear unpromising, although Trump’s unpredictability makes it hard to gauge how the shutdown showdown will play out. “It’s simple: the Senate is not going to send something to the president that he won’t sign,” said a spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. The Democratic legislation will mark the first major battle pitting the incoming Democratic House majority led by Nancy Pelosi against Mr Trump and Mr McConnell. “While President Trump drags the nation into week two of the Trump Shutdown and sits in the White House and tweets, without offering any plan that can pass both chambers of Congress, Democrats are taking action to lead our country out of this mess,” Ms Pelosi and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement. Democrats oppose Mr Trump’s demand for wall funding, with Ms Pelosi calling the wall immoral, ineffective and expensive. Democrats hope their two-pronged funding approach will put Senate Republicans in a tough position. If they reject funding for departments unconnected to border security, Republicans could be seen as holding those agencies and their roughly 800,000 affected workers hostage to Mr Trump’s wall demand. “Then they are complicit with President Trump in continuing the Trump shutdown and in holding the health and safety of the American people and workers’ pay cheques hostage over the wall,” Ms Pelosi and Mr Schumer said in their statement. Non-border-related agencies include the Departments of Agriculture, Interior, Transportation, Commerce and Justice. The homeland security piece of the package includes $1.3 billion for border fencing and roughly $300 million more for other border security items including cameras and technology. Democrats said the entire package is based on legislation that has already been passed by either the Senate or Senate committees. The shutdown, which began on December 22nd and has idled roughly a quarter of the federal government, was precipitated by Mr Trump’s demand, under pressure from conservative commentators, that Congress approve $5 billion to help fund a wall that was a promise made in his 2016 election campaign, although he said at the time it would be paid for by Mexico. – Reuters "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3745394.1546363806!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nasa spacecraft phones home after far flung flyby","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern gives a high five to Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman after the team received signals from the spacecraft that it is intact. Photograph: EPANasa scientists were celebrating after a spacecraft “phoned home” to confirm it had successfully performed the most distant space flyby in history in the early hours of New Year’s Day.Thousands of photographs of the dark, icy space rock called Ultima Thule were snapped by the New Horizons probe as it barrelled past it on the outer edge of the solar system at 05.33 Irish time.Ultima Thule lies 4 billion miles from Earth in the Kuiper belt, a band of dwarf planets, space rocks and icy debris left over from the formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago. Because of the distance, scientists had to wait 10 hours to learn whether the flyby had been successful.“It’s a once in a lifetime opportunity,” said Hal Weaver, a research professor at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland and a project scientist on the New Horizons mission. “This is another great step in the exploration of our solar system.”In 2015, New Horizons flew past Pluto and captured a stunning series of photographs of the dwarf planet’s surface. The images revealed Pluto to be a world where nitrogen mountains tower above the ground and volcano eruptions discharge ice into a thin hydrocarbon atmosphere.In recent weeks scientists on the New Horizons team have scoured pictures from the spacecraft’s Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (Lorri) for signs of trouble ahead. At such speed, a particle the size of a grain of rice could have knocked out the spacecraft. If the team had spotted dust rings around Ultima Thule, the spacecraft would have been nudged on to a more cautious trajectory that would have taken it further from its target.Little is known about Ultima Thule, or 2014 MU69 to use its official name. But based on preliminary observations, scientists think it may resemble a giant peanut with two large lobes fused together. The dark rock may contain frozen carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, molecular nitrogen and methane, which may be exposed by impact craters on the surface.While some comets that streak through the solar system are thought to have originated in the Kuiper belt, those as distant as Ultima Thule have remained on the outer edges of the solar system since birth. For this reason it is thought that objects such as Ultima Thule, the so-called cold classical Kuiper belt objects, look the same today as they did at the dawn of the solar system.“We’ve never explored a body as primordial or as far away from the sun as Ultima Thule,” said Mohamed Ramy El Maarry, a New Horizons science team collaborator and lecturer at Birkbeck, University of London. “This gives us a chance to look at what comets are like before they enter the inner solar system. They’ve been in deep freeze since they formed 4.6 billion years ago.”He added: “What’s really exciting is we expect to see surprises. We are really looking at the basic ingredients of the solar system. This can tell us a lot about the building blocks of the solar system, about the conditions when the solar system formed, and about other solar systems as well.” –  service"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Harry\u0026#39s birth name Henry hits top spot but Meghan is nowhere to be seenPerhaps  readers have been inspired by the Royal wedding. Henry - Prince Harry’s birth name - has risen to the top of the charts for baby boys, according to  birth announcements.The name Henry shares top place with Arthur among  readers. Margot, a lowly 12th in 2017, and Matilda are joint top of the girls’ list.Henry rose to top from third last year, possibly on the strength of Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle in May. The order of service, made public on the eve of the wedding, listed the groom under his official title His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales.Matilda The Musical, based on Roald Dahl\u0026#39s bookRoyal names dominate the boys’ list. After Henry and Arthur in the  readers’ popularity stakes comes Edward, William and George.Girls’ names are not seemingly on Royal message. There are no Meghans - in fact there hasn’t been a Meghan with that spelling since 2001 - and no Kates or Catherines in the top 30. There was a Queen Matilda on the English throne - she was married to King Stephen - but you have to go back almost 900 years.Margot Robbie on the red carpetMore likely Matildas are being named after Roald Dahl’s heroine, now hugely popular in an award-winning musical, while the incidences of Margot is trickier to explain. The Australian actress Margot Robbie, one of the hottest stars in Hollywood, is one possible explanation.Susan Cole, a retired librarian, from Sutton, Surrey, who has been compiling the list for almost 50 years since 1969, said: “Henry now tops the list but Harry doesn’t even make the top ten. Surprisingly Harry comes in at only 21st, well below Henry.”Ms Cole suggested that the Royal wedding - and the prominent use of the name Henry on the order of service - could have swung it among more traditional  readers.

Seratonin, due out on Friday, focuses on the festering rage in provincial France that has exploded into the “yellow vest” protests.Like his previous books, it is set to become an instant bestseller and is already being hailed as the biggest literary event of 2019. It is also likely to enrage those who object to the views that have made Houellebecq, 62, an iconic figure for the nationalist, eurosceptic Right.The title of the novel, to appear in English in the autumn, refers to the main ingredient of an anti-depressant that causes its anti-hero, Florent-Claude Labrouste, to suffer impotence and nausea. Like most of Houellebecq’s protagonists, he is a thinly disguised version of the author himself.At 46, fed up with his Japanese girlfriend and his job, Labrouste returns to his native Normandy, where he meets suicidal farmers, prevented from making ends meet by EU dairy quotas. Out of despair and fury, they take to the streets and stop traffic in “yellow vest” style.Houellebecq’s bleak view of France and Europe is much in evidence. “No one in the West will ever be happy again,” he writes. “This is how a civilisation dies, without danger or drama and with very little carnage.”His previous book, Submission, about a Muslim president governing France under Islamic law, was featured on the cover of Charlie Hebdo just days before the magazine’s office was attacked by Islamist gunmen in 2015.Forced at times to live under police protection, Houellebecq continues to provoke outrage with blunt, often pungent comments on religion, politics and society.“I’m prepared to vote for anyone provided we propose to exit the European Union and Nato,” Houllebecq, 62, said in October. “Europe has chosen a particular mode of suicide that involves murdering the nations that make it up.”Ahead of Seratonin’s publication, his wife, Qianyum Lysis Li, a woman of Chinese origin 20 years his junior, has posted intimate photographs of the writer on Instagram, including one of him naked in bed, apparently with her and another woman.Please review our commenting policyAdverts from tech giants help to fund apps for paedophilesBritish Transport Police officers bear brunt of assaultsDirector of Uffizi Galleries in Florence demands that Germany hands back Nazi-looted paintingPrince Charles leads tributes on centenary of Iolaire disaster which killed 201 peopleSteakgate: a blow-by-blow account of the \u0026#39fracas\u0026#39 that got Jeremy Clarkson firedRevellers shake off New Year hangovers in Firth of ForthSerena Williams jokes: \u0026#39I was just warming up!\u0026#39 after Roger Federer wins Battle of the SexesBorder Force risking collisions in English Channel with \u0026#39unseaman-like\u0026#39 operationsHouthi rebels in Yemen deny stealing UN food aid, accusing world body of biasIsrael\u0026#39s main opposition party in dramatic split ahead of electionComment: Jeremy Corbyn must trust his instincts and back a no-deal BrexitThousands march in Hong Kong for democracy and independence from China Leak on International Space Station blamed on \u0026#39botched repair job\u0026#39Man drives car into group of migrants in Germany in suspected xenophobic attackIndian PM strips islands of British colonial names - and renames them after freedom fighterBelgium to brew first non-alcoholic \u0026#39abbey beer\u0026#39 as monks tipple threatened by healthy living revolution10-month-old baby girl rescued from collapsed Russian apartment block where more than 30 remain missingMan crashes car into crowd in TokyoDoctor Who: the 10 best Dalek storiesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/12/03/TELEMMGLPICT000180409668_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqDLyVoJxGJQ4iGYZVZw1qGnj3KXGd6R-OklMDNS15Wz8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"iran hosts taliban peace talks eyeing opening us drawdown","story":"Head of Political Office of the Taliban Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanakzai, left, attends the second round in Moscow last yearThe Taliban discussed Afghanistan\u0027s post-occupation situation with Iran in their latest meeting, the group said Tuesday, as Tehran makes a more concerted and open push for peace ahead of a possible US drawdown.The remarks come after Iran confirmed Monday that the Taliban had visited Tehran for a second round of talks in just a few days that are aimed at ending the 17-year conflict.The Taliban delegation discussed with Iran the post-occupation situation, restoration of peace and security in Afghanistan and the region, the militants said in a statement posted on social media and emailed to journalists.It signals a growing confidence among the Taliban for US troops to pull out of Afghanistan, after US officials last month told various media outlets that President Donald Trump had decided to slash the number of boots on the ground.There have been reports in the past of talks between Iran and the Taliban, but they have typically been denied by Tehran.Afghan National Army soldiers stand guard at a checkpoint ahead of parliamentary elections, in Kabul, AfghanistanTehran\u0027s peace push will be viewed with concern by hawks in Washington, who fear that Trump\u0027s planned withdrawal of troops from Syria and Afghanistan will cede regional influence to Iran.The Taliban also met with the United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in the United Arab Emirates earlier in December as part of a flurry of diplomatic efforts to end the war.But the Taliban refused to meet a delegation from Afghanistan. The group said Saturday its representatives would not meet with those of the Kabul administration at the next meeting expected to be held in Saudi Arabia later this month.Iran\u0027s deputy foreign ministry Abbas Araghchi will travel to Afghanistan in the next two weeks, the foreign ministry said, without giving further details.Iran and Afghanistan share a nearly 600-mile border, and have had a complex relationship in recent years.Tehran has long supported its co-religionists in Afghanistan, the Shia Hazara minority, who were violently persecuted by the Taliban during its rule in the 1990s.Iran worked alongside the United States and Western powers to help drive out the Taliban after the US-led invasion in 2001.But there have been allegations, from Western and Afghan sources, that Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards have in recent years established ties with the Taliban aimed at driving out US forces from Afghanistan.Please review our commenting policyAdverts from tech giants help to fund apps for paedophilesBritish Transport Police officers bear brunt of assaultsDirector of Uffizi Galleries in Florence demands that Germany hands back Nazi-looted paintingPrince Charles leads tributes on centenary of Iolaire disaster which killed 201 peopleFrance honours its most provocative author Steakgate: a blow-by-blow account of the \u0026#39fracas\u0026#39 that got Jeremy Clarkson firedRevellers shake off New Year hangovers in Firth of ForthSerena Williams jokes: \u0026#39I was just warming up!\u0026#39 after Roger Federer wins Battle of the SexesBorder Force risking collisions in English Channel with \u0026#39unseaman-like\u0026#39 operationsHouthi rebels in Yemen deny stealing UN food aid, accusing world body of biasIsrael\u0026#39s main opposition party in dramatic split ahead of electionComment: Jeremy Corbyn must trust his instincts and back a no-deal BrexitThousands march in Hong Kong for democracy and independence from China Leak on International Space Station blamed on \u0026#39botched repair job\u0026#39Man drives car into group of migrants in Germany in suspected xenophobic attackIndian PM strips islands of British colonial names - and renames them after freedom fighterBelgium to brew first non-alcoholic \u0026#39abbey beer\u0026#39 as monks tipple threatened by healthy living revolution10-month-old baby girl rescued from collapsed Russian apartment block where more than 30 remain missingMan crashes car into crowd in TokyoDoctor Who: the 10 best Dalek storiesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/01/01/TELEMMGLPICT000184353773_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwR9CmnucIcqQaI247kVHKfVSc7sVuZw6puPpK1VdXwk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"israels main opposition party dramatic split ahead election","story":"Tzipi Livni speaks during a discussion to vote on the dissolution of the Israeli Parliament in the KnessetThe main opposition bloc to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u0027s party dramatically split  on New Year\u0027s Day, leaving the centre-Left Zionist Union without its most prominent politician, just four months out from an election.Avi Gabbay, Labour’s leader, announced on Tuesday that the party would run independently, without the smaller Hatnua movement of Tzipi Livni, former foreign minister.I hoped and believed this alliance would bring about our blossoming, a real connection and we would complement each other.

Thank you, she said, and then left the room.Benjamin Netanyahu sits among Likud party MPs Gilad Ardan (L) and Yisrael Katz (R) during a parliament session in Jerusalem on December 26At a news conference later in the day, Ms Livni said she would continue to lead Hatnua into the election, although the party has just five MPs in the 120-member parliament, compared with Labour\u0027s 19 and Likud\u0027s 30.What is more important than Labour parting ways with Hatnua is to leave the path on which this government is leading us, so we will be able to separate from the Palestinians, she said, referring to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The Zionist Union bloc has lagged behind Likud in recent polling, where it was predicted to capture only eight to nine seats compared with the 24 it holds in the current parliament.Opinion polls predict Likud will win the election Mr Netanyahu called for April 9, taking between 27 to 31 seats - enough to lead a Right-wing coalition, despite three corruption investigations against him.An Israeli UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter performs during a graduation ceremony of Israeli air force pilots at the Hatzerim Air Force base in Israel\u0026#39s Negev desert Mr Netanyahu has fought off multiple corruption allegations that have plagued him for the last year.His party has only grown in popularity as regional threats to the Jewish state increase.He yesterday feted his rapprochement with Sunni Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, as part of his bid to form an bulwark against Israel’s number one foe - Iran.Israel’s attorney general is expected to announce his decision on whether to charge Mr Netanyahu in the coming months. The premier would not be required to step down if indicted, although could face political pressure to do so.Indeed, the prime minister said on Tuesday that he would not resign in the event of his indictment.Imagine what would happen if a prime minister is ousted before the hearing is finished, and then after the hearing they decide to close the case. It\u0027s absurd. It\u0027s a terrible blow to democracy, he said at a news conference in Rio de Janeiro.Mr Gabbay\u0027s decision is the latest realignment ahead of the election and more are expected.On Saturday, Naftali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked, two right-wing ministers, announced they were splitting from their Jewish Home party to form a new one that they hope will attract a mixture of secular and religious voters.Please review our commenting policyAdverts from tech giants help to fund apps for paedophilesBritish Transport Police officers bear brunt of assaultsDirector of Uffizi Galleries in Florence demands that Germany hands back Nazi-looted paintingPrince Charles leads tributes on centenary of Iolaire disaster which killed 201 peopleFrance honours its most provocative author Steakgate: a blow-by-blow account of the \u0026#39fracas\u0026#39 that got Jeremy Clarkson firedRevellers shake off New Year hangovers in Firth of ForthSerena Williams jokes: \u0026#39I was just warming up!\u0026#39 after Roger Federer wins Battle of the SexesBorder Force risking collisions in English Channel with \u0026#39unseaman-like\u0026#39 operationsHouthi rebels in Yemen deny stealing UN food aid, accusing world body of biasComment: Jeremy Corbyn must trust his instincts and back a no-deal BrexitThousands march in Hong Kong for democracy and independence from China Leak on International Space Station blamed on \u0026#39botched repair job\u0026#39Man drives car into group of migrants in Germany in suspected xenophobic attackIndian PM strips islands of British colonial names -

After the highs of 2017, which saw the price of bitcoin surge to $20,000 (£15,700), the world\u0027s most valuable cryptocurrency is currently trading close to its lowest point in 16 months.Bitcoin has fallen\u0026nbspby 3 per cent over the last 24 hours, adding to losses of 5 per cent in the last week, 10 per cent in the last month and almost 80 per cent over the last year – leaving little doubt\u0026nbspthat last year\u0027s peak was indeed the result of an over-inflated bubble.There have been five major price spikes in bitcoin\u0027s 10 year history, and after each previous crash the market has managed to recover to even higher levels. But the scale of the 2018 losses have left some cryptocurrency experts questioning whether bitcoin will once again see a market turn-around.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialPredicting bitcoin\u0027s fortunes in 2019 has therefore ided analysts, with forecasts from high-profile figures within the cryptocurrency industry ranging from a complete capitulation, to a 10-fold increase from today\u0027s price of $3,650.The most radical predictions come from bitcoin cash founder Calvin Ayre and Fundstrat\u0026nbspco-founder Thomas Lee.

FTSE 100 CEOs are falling like skittles FTSE 100 reaches record high as pound sterling drops to 2018 low Nonetheless, The Independent’s fortune tellers are bravely stepping into the breach again having taken a refresher course under Professor Trelawney (Harry Potter fans will know what I mean). We’ve also lined up a panel of worthies from the City. Our sincere thanks to all of them for being such good sports and putting their heads above the parapet.\u0026nbspI’ve changed the rules a bit this year: our panel was told they could vary their predictions based on possible Brexit outcomes, because, well, who could possibly make an accurate prediction for where that will end up?\u0026nbspBut before we get down to business, the usual warning. This feature is designed to be fun. If you’re going to put actual money down, do your own research into stocks and the markets and consider taking professional advice too.As the editor of this feature, I get to go first. That’s not something I relish looking into the fog that surrounds 2019. But here goes.\u0026nbspMarkets are due a rally after this year’s sell off, the FTSE 100 in particular. It’s suffered from the complete lack of appetite for UK assets, something else to thank Brexit for. But it is also worth remembering that it’s dominated by international companies that make most of their money overseas. It means there is real\u0026nbspvalue to be had for the savvy investor, and perhaps a lot. If some kind of Brexit deal is reached, or better still we have a referendum and stay, I’m going for a relief rally (at some point) and an end of year close of 7,200, which I admit might look optimistic. If it’s no deal, then we’re in real trouble. The markets will hate it, so maybe 6,800. Why not worse? If\u0026nbspthe pound really collapses, the UK’s foreign currency earning stocks could start to look absurdly cheap. But I’d advise heading out of the country if you have the option.Stock pick: HSBC (646.9p). CYBG (181.2p) if Brexit is resolvedI’ve no great love for HSBC, which has had a chequered regulatory history in recent years. That said, while it has a big UK business, its most important markets are\u0026nbspin the far east and it reports earnings in US dollars. The third quarter results were unexpectedly good and the shares have climbed since then. But it’s still offering a prospective idend yield of 6 per cent, with no signs that the payout is under any threat. That’s right, 6 per cent. Eventually people will wake up to a number like that. With the UK in turmoil, there are good reasons for investors to look to this most international of banks. If you think Brexit will end well, and the sugar plum fairy actually exists, however, take a look at challenger bank CYBG following its acquisition of Virgin Money. That was a sweet deal and yet the business trades on just six times earnings.\u0026nbspIf this ends better than I expect, its current price\u0026nbspcould look ridiculously cheap this time next year.While global stock markets looked like they were heading in the right direction earlier this year, they’re moving\u0026nbspinto 2019 on a markedly different path. The FTSE 100 hit record highs in May off the back of the weakened pound. However, while sterling continued its decline throughout the rest of the year, it was not enough to sustain the stock market’s strength. The root of all this volatility was, of course, Brexit, and it doesn’t seem like that’s going to be cleared up any time soon.If the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal, the pound is likely to see a crash of its own – but as we now know, that doesn’t necessarily mean a rally for the FTSE anymore. It could head back towards multi-year lows as investors scramble to distance themselves from the UK. Even if Theresa May manages to get some sort of deal through parliament, it will be some time before we know what sort of impact the new arrangement is having.It seems foolish to make any predictions but I’m going to target a FTSE 100 close of 7,000 – which seems wildly optimistic at this point in time.IAG is the owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberia, among others. The FTSE 100 company has paid out pretty hefty idends in recent years, and it’s relatively cheap at the moment – the share price was knocked severely by a cyber attack over the summer. Despite concerns that a potential no-deal Brexit could wreak havoc on air travel in the UK, chief executive Willie Walsh has not wavered from his positive outlook and says the company is confident that it will not be harmed by disruption to flying rights – so confident that the group announced a €2.6bn investment plan in November. With oil prices forecast to drop over the next year, fuel costs should be more manageable too.It’s not been a vintage year for global stock markets. Most are lower than where they started. However, that’s the nature of the beast: stock market returns are lumpy. The UK economy continues to limp along, though a pick up in wage growth has been encouraging. Clearly Brexit is the big swing factor when it comes to the year ahead, and until there is some resolution on that front we can expect sentiment to remain febrile.With the FTSE 100, I’m once again going to play the averages (it only works as a strategy if you do it year in year out!) The FTSE adds about 5 per cent a year on average, excluding idends, so from current levels that puts us somewhere near 7,050.Stock pick: Lloyd’s Banking Group (51.85p) assuming\u0026nbspan orderly Brexit.\u0026nbspDiageo\u0026nbsp(2,795p)\u0026nbsp in the event of a disorderly BrexitIn an orderly Brexit outcome my stock pick would be Lloyds Banking Group.\u0026nbsp It currently has a prospective idend yield of around 5.5 per cent. When CEO Antonio Horta Osorio took over in 2011, the bank was making a loss of £260m. Last year it made a £3.5bn profit, yet the share price is lower than when he started. The market is selling down Lloyds because, at best, it doesn’t know what the next year holds for the bank’s profitability while Brexit hangs in the balance. If the UK economy is unscathed we can expect the share price to pick up. In bad outcome, all stocks are likely to come under pressure in the short term. So is the pound. Bets can be hedged a bit by holding an internationally ersified defensive stock like Diageo. The manufacturer of Guinness and Johnny Walker gets most of its revenues from overseas. And let’s face we’ll probably all need a drink in this scenario.Political shenanigans in Westminster and the ongoing negotiations with Brussels mean that offering any sort of forecast for the UK economy in 2019 is a pretty thankless task. You can see the pound going to $1 in the event of a Brexit outcome that markets don’t like and it going back to $1.50 if the negotiations are seen as finally yielding a positive result, so at $1.25 sterling is probably appropriately priced right nowWhen it comes to the FTSE 100 the darkest hour comes before the dawn and with pessimism so pervasive the market may have a better chance of making it to 8,000 by the end of 2019 than many suspect. It is trading at levels last seen in December 2016 and even languishes below the high reached at the climax of the technology bubble in December 1999. As such, a good degree of bad news may already be factored into the valuation of UK assets, especially as the pound is still trading some 13 per cent below where it stood on the day of the EU referendum in June 2016. Unloved often means undervalued and the UK is not expensive relative to its international peers or its own history on an earnings basis.\u0026nbspIt also offers a prospective yield of 4.9 per cent, which beats base rates pretty handily and also outstrips the 1.25 per cent yield of 10-year UK government bonds.I’m normally wary of banks but in the case of the FTSE 250 “challenger”\u0026nbspOneSavings Bank I am prepared to make an exception. The stock trades on barely 6.5 times earnings and 1.4 times book value while offering a idend yield of 4.1 per cent. If everything goes wrong from a political or macroeconomic perspective, the lowly valuation could provide some relative downside protection, while the yield may offer some compensation for the risks involved as investors tough it out. A Brexit deal triggering a rally in sterling, and a resurgence in interest in UK assets, will put stocks like OneSavings Bank in the vanguard of a recovery, especially as loan growth is robust. The firm’s return on equity of 26 per cent is outstanding relative to its peer group. Given the bank’s exposure to mortgages, smaller companies and its strong focus on buy-to-let there are clear risks. Any economic and house price downturn could test sentiment and profits. But the valuation is low.Brexit, Donald Trump’s trade war and budget tensions between Italy, France and eurozone authorities will be major drivers of markets as politics dominates the start of 2019. The future shape of the UK’s relationship with the European Union remains unclear. A chaotic Brexit is likely to result in a fall in the pound, which is positive for the FTSE 100 as the majority of its earnings are generated abroad. However, a sharp rally in sterling could be negative for the index and any gains will be capped. Hopefully Donald Trump will be pushed in the direction of getting some sort resolution with China over the trade dispute so he can declare a “win” sooner rather than later. This will be positive for markets worldwide. The biggest risk is that the US Federal Reserve oversteps the mark and slams the brakes on the US economy too hard. However, there are signs that the central bank may be more doveish than many expected My FTSE 100 prediction: 7,100Growth at this Middle Eastern private healthcare network operator is supported by a strong economy in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the rollout of mandatory health insurance in the country. It also benefits from the UAE’s limited corporation tax regime and is expanding into Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Its new joint venture in Saudi Arabia, which will see it become one of the largest healthcare operators in the kingdom, is due to complete in the first quarter of 2019.Andy Brown, head of direct equities, Tilney Asset Management\u0026nbspLooking into next year, in the near term sentiment towards UK shares will depend in large part on what happens between now and the end of March when the UK is set to leave the EU. Many of the big UK political risks appear to be playing out now in the form of a potentially messy Brexit and with doubts about the sustainability of the current UK government. These anxieties are reflected in current UK equity valuations, which at 11 times earnings, are well below other developed markets and their longer-term trend.It’s important not to confuse UK equities and the domestic economy. In fact well over two-thirds of the earnings of FTSE 100 companies in aggregate are made outside of the UK. Currency volatility is likely to remain a feature which will have both an operational and financial impact of many UK companies. Not only are UK equities at discounted valuations, idends remain an attractive feature of the UK market both compared with\u0026nbspother regions and bond yields.

We are not short of key themes to ensure a bumpy ride across the year Trade wars, China slowdown, US Federal Reserve tightening (or not), Brexit and Italy all point to 2018’s volatility continuing if not rising in the year to come.The already challenging task of crystal-ball-gazing is almost impossible heading into 2019. With so much uncertainty surrounding Brexit and just three months to go to the break, perhaps the only certainty for the pound and the FTSE 100 is the continuation of this new uncertain phase.The year just gone has been a nightmare for the FTSE, which is down around 11 per cent this year, despite a 5 per cent drop in sterling. Weakness in the pound is good news for all the international stocks on the FTSE, around 70 per cent of the index itself. However, we expect broader fears of slowing global growth to ramp up across 2019, starting as soon as January with a softer US earnings season.Predictions for the FTSE would need to be split depending on the type of Brexit Theresa May secures. A disorderly, no-deal Brexit could see the pound plummet which would offer more support to the FTSE, as we saw post the Brexit referendum. However, a key difference is that the global economy was in better position in 2016. Under this scenario we envisage a very volatile year with the FTSE ending only marginally higher.A Brexit deal will see the pound recover some ground, adding pressure to the FTSE. A stronger pound, plus growing concerns over global growth would mean a difficult year for the FTSE which could close lower.Making money on stocks in 2019 amid such uncertainty will require careful choices. Gold has not lifted off this year, shedding 5 per cent of its value as a strong US economy and the\u0026nbspFederal Reserve\u0026nbsphiking rates have boosted faith in the dollar. However, with the Fed expected to slow its rate of interest rate rises this year the glitter could return to gold. With the precious metal expected to increase between 5 per cent and 15 per cent miner Randgold Resources will be a stock to watch.It has been a volatile year, although much of this comes off the back of 2017, one of quietest on record. The “synchronised global growth”\u0026nbspidea disappeared fairly early on, and trade wars have certainly not helped matters. The great post-2008 bull market has not come to an end, but it has taken quite a kicking. Things will remain volatile, but some of the bearishness and pessimism is perhaps overdone.If Brexit ends with a dealRemain, then the FTSE\u0026nbsp100\u0026nbspcould hit 7,500, but if no deal 6,000.\u0026nbspThe life insurer has good exposure to Asia, a strong idend, and is reasonably valued. I think this works in both situations.Stephen\u0026nbspAdams, head of equities, Kames CapitalDisorderly Brexit risk, Corbyn risk, earnings risk, monetary policy risk: it is little wonder then that the FTSE 100 is down. Nor is it clear that any of these pressures are abating as we head into the start of 2019. However, on a 12-month view it is possible to see the catalysts for a higher UK equity market.UK equities are the contrarian global asset class,\u0026nbspand any clarity on Brexit short of a no-deal cliff edge would likely be taken well. It is also possible that the economy would enjoy a relief bounce with the release of some pent up demand and a looser fiscal stance. In that scenario I would envisage the FTSE at 7,450 by year end 2019.By mid-year we may also witness a pause in US monetary tightening and a stabilisation in rebased earnings per share forecasts. Even with a no-deal Brexit I could see a FTSE little changed over the year as sterling takes the strain and the high percentage of overseas earnings in the blue chip index receive\u0026nbspa boost on any devaluation, so\u0026nbsp6,800.The deal with Schneider materially enhanced the sales opportunities for Aveva’s world class portfolio of design, engineering, construction and industrial software solutions. Recent updates have proved reassuring and with a significant proportion of the company’s earnings in foreign currency,\u0026nbspAveva would receive translational benefits on any sterling weakness.\u0026nbspBalfour Beatty, meanwhile,\u0026nbsphas undergone a painstaking and protracted period of dealing with underperforming contracts and has emerged with a strong balance sheet, rising margins and resilient cash flows unlike some competitors. As a contractor with a number of UK government contracts the stock should bounce on a Brexit deal and the valuation should see an upward re-rating.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Andy Martin reportsClick to followThe IndependentZia and his Velocity co-founder Alex MacdonaldI was wearing my Kenzo patchwork jacket, my Billabong denim shirt, and a sort of Gareth Southgate waistcoat. And I had slapped on David Beckham\u0026nbspHomme quite liberally. I was taking notes with my Montblanc pen, trying to blend in with supermodels, Premiership footballers\u0026nbspand hedge fund manager types\u0026nbspat a snazzy restaurant in the upmarket Tribeca neighbourhood of Manhattan. Because I was having a power breakfast with Zia Yusuf, co-founder and CEO of Velocity. And if you’re worrying about how much it costs to join, then it’s probably not for you. “And your membership name is?” said the exceptionally charming hostess at the door. For a brief while, I was living the dream. Even the smashed avocado on toast seemed like the best smashed avocado I’d ever tasted. Likewise the coffee. And the cutlery and the napkins were outstanding too. “My mum told me not to buy nice things,” Yusuf says, “because you always lose them.” Velocity doesn’t do things, it does experiences. In an exclusive way. For “premium consumers”. “We treat members as human beings,” said Yusuf, “not very rich people.”Yusuf’s key insight is that even if you’re as rich as Croesus, you still need a digital Jeeves – an all-purpose concierge service – to fix things for you, discreetly, effortlessly, infallibly. I didn’t even try to download the Velocity app. It can probably spot if you’re not a billionaire.A View from the Top with Herschel Mayers, CEO of VitalityA View from the Top: ViaVan London chief Jess Oppetit A View from the Top: SlimFast boss Lindsay Reisser-WestonA View from the Top: Jacqueline de Rojas on discrimination in techZia Yusuf, 32, did not come from money. Born in a village outside Aberdeen, he is the son of Sri Lankan parents. His father is a paediatrician for the NHS and his mother is a nurse. At the age of 13 he had a moment that he still recalls fondly, when his father came into his room and said, “Do you want to go to Disney World?” He had always wanted to go to Disney in Paris, but his father said, “We’re not going there, we’re going to the original in Florida!” They had scrimped and saved and maxed out the credit card and it was still 10 months in the future – and the young Yusuf was so excited he could hardly sleep for the last month. “But it was something to look forward too. That’s what we try to provide at Velocity. It’s about making you feel like a kid again.”He went to Hampton School, then studied international relations at the LSE. In his final year he signed up for Merrill Lynch, for the sake of “peace of mind”. But this was in 2008. After Lehman Brothers went to the wall he got in touch with the guy who had given him the job, just to make sure everything was still in place. He got an automated message back: “This person is no longer with the company…” Nothing is plain sailing. Everything always goes wrong. Unless, that is, you’re a Velocity member. There’s a story by Kafka of a bloke who goes up to an open door but the doorman keeps him waiting outside for years until he is finally dying and then he slams it shut. Tough. Velocity is like that, but the exact opposite. There’s a guy holding the door open and ushering you through it very respectfully wherever you go. If you’re a member, you’re walking on a red carpet the whole world over. You get the top table at the Ivy or a seat at the Wimbledon final. If you want to go surfing, they’ll arrange the perfect wave, with palm trees and sultry breezes, just for you. If you’re looking for the Holy Grail, it’s here, somewhere on the app. You want the moon? Have it. Have two. You have a dream? Dream no longer. “We’re a tech company,” says Yusuf, pushing a perfect mini-croissant in my direction. “But tech is a means not an end in itself.” The average “basket size” is $2,500. The biggest is $500k – for a single transaction. Client data is sacrosanct. No harvesting or marketing. Trust is paramount. F Scott Fitzgerald reckoned that “the very rich are different from you and me”. Ernest Hemingway replied, “Yes, they have more money.” Yusuf is more of the Hemingway school of thought. It was while at Goldman Sachs that he realised two things. One is that the super-rich have exactly the same anxieties and desires as everyone else. And the other is that they are not “leading crazy lives of hedonistic pleasure”. “They’re obsessed with what they do. They have more capital, but they suffer from time poverty.” Velocity gives them time back again by doing everything for them at the click of a button. Check the app. You want to go and swim with blue whales? It’s done. You want to… and here, glancing through the app, I come across something so sublime that I am not even allowed to say what it is. “As easy as ordering an Uber.” There is no hassle. Hassle has been abolished in the great and glorious realm of Velocity. It is, I have to concede, a wonderful world. Velocity was born in 2014 and launched in public after two years of development. “We (Yusuf and co-founder Alex Macdonald) agreed with Elon Musk – it can’t be slightly better, it’s got to be amazing.” They can do something as simple and sentimental as picking up your grandma at the airport too. And there is a romantic side. They have now arranged 14 full marriage proposals, always in the perfect setting, with (so far) 100 per cent success rate. I imagine they can do orces too, in a beautiful way. Yusuf himself used his own app recently. He had almost forgotten his mother’s birthday. Velocity stepped in and saved the day: a Sri Lankan-style dinner at Hoppers in London. “My Mum is hard to please,” says Yusuf, but she was delighted. “It was a lot better than an e-card.” He’s going to take her on safari the next time.It’s hard not to agree with Yusuf that “the paradox is that we have the ability to go and do more than any generation in history. But our tendency is to order in a pizza and binge on Netflix.” He wants to get busy people out into the real world again – effortlessly. And he stresses a surprisingly ethical dimension to the whole business. It’s not just about arranging meaningful and magical moments, or even matrimony. These experiences can actually make a difference to the wider world because the people having them also have a lot of power. Yusuf cites the case of a CEO who went on a “giraffe collaring” adventure with a team of conservationists. “He came out of it a changed man. His company went green overnight and he killed all single-use plastic cups. And our platform made it happen. Nothing beats an experience for changing your view of the world.” Which is why the velocity.black website has a special section called “impact”. “It all sounds great,” said a hard-working single mother who was giving me a lift later in the day, as I was coming down from Cloud 9. There was just a hint of bitterness in her voice. “I would like to go swimming with whales and tagging giraffes. Can I join?” “Of course you can,” I replied, soothingly. “You just have to win the lottery first.”A View from the TopOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He would ring, to tell me what the weather was like over there, while I was suffering, in grey, wet, chilly London. Or how, he was enjoying some fine, French wine he’d taken specially while sitting with his feet dangling in the warm, balmy sea.Not any more. So far, the phone has lain silent. Although after reading this, he might ring again, as he did in the summer, because I wrote something he did not agree with. Once again, I was treated to a volley of abuse, much of it too crude to repeat here.It’s been a recurring theme of 2018, the PR demise of Sir Philip Green or “PG” as he is known throughout the sector and City. When the year began, he’d still not recovered from the fallout over the sale of BHS to someone who did not have the financial muscle to take on a business of that size, and Green’s subsequent refusal to plug the company’s pension deficit. He did cough up, eventually, and only after much protest.Then, came Oliver Shah’s excellent biography, Damaged Goods: the Inside Story of Sir Philip Green, the Collapse of BHS and the Death of the High Street. It painted a colourful picture of Green, and his swaggering, bruising manner.That was followed by the revelation that Green had gagged former employees from detailing his sexual and racial harassment – claims that he vehemently denies.Finally, Green’s Arcadia group was exposed to what was a horrid shopping season. It certainly was an annus horribilis for him, reputation-wise, not that he would ever reach for a polite Latin phrase as the Queen once famously did – Green would opt for a more Anglo-Saxon wording.Sir Philip Green’s and Simon Cowell business partnership Spare a thought for poor old billionaire Philip GreenSir Philip Green’s net worth and retail empireWhen he looks back on where it all went wrong – to apply some context he remains incredibly wealthy, is still a high street force, retains his knighthood, and became a grandfather, but there’s no doubt he’s suffered – he only has himself to blame.That sense of self, of believing entirely in his own gifts, has propelled him to great heights. He’s a natural, intuitive, aggressive deal-maker, blessed with an uncanny propensity for mental arithmetic. Whether he’s a genius at the longer game of retailing is a moot point. Certainly, he knew how to build an empire, and to keep it buoyant – for a while. But did he read the long-term runes, and foresee the advent of online shopping, and did he exhibit the same fleetness of foot as some of his competitors?Green is not someone who responds constructively to criticism. If the media and politicians attack his convoluted financial arrangements that see the business vested in the name of his wife who lives in Monaco as a way of avoiding tax, he will roar his defiance.A more publicly empathetic person, one who cares deeply about how they’re perceived, who can see that the tax line will dog him constantly and be wheeled out as a weapon to beat him with, might end the arrangement and swallow the resulting hefty bill. But they would regard it as a price worth paying, for better treatment by the press and parliament, for a favourable public standing.Not Green. Similarly, from the off, as soon as the BHS affair blew up, he could have made a payment to cover the pension gap into an escrow account, and leave the lawyers to sort out the fine detail. But he chose not to.He complained that his opponents liked to focus on his extravagant, bling lifestyle. Meanwhile, he would order another superyacht, so that he owned not one, but two. His reasoning was that his spending was none of their concern, that what he did with his money was up to him. He would describe his lavish parties as private, but then call journalists to invite them to listen, down the line, as George Michael did a sound-check.He’s never fully appreciated that he is also a public figure, a modern celebrity, who courted publicity for himself and for his fashion products, who liked to be photographed surrounded by supermodels. In many town centres, his outlets play a vital role, as anchor tenants, central to the wellbeing of the shopping districts and accompanying communities. Green is a major employer, responsible for several tens of thousands of jobs. He cannot have it both ways.As with many kings, his world is also that of a court. His advisers are courtiers, there, possibly, to please not help, to say “can” rather than “can’t”, and “yes” not “no”. It’s questionable, whether his actions and the blows to his image are the result of receiving bad advice, or disregarding good advice and preferring to do his own thing. Whatever the answer, he became badly unstuck in 2018. For that, he was my Man of the Year, but for all the wrong reasons.For anyone looking at how not to manage communications, how to make a bad public relations situation worse, Green’s last 12 months is a textbook tour de force.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The major update – which would have been perhaps the biggest change to Instagram ever – was so widely despised that numerous users suggested the app is now dead.But very shortly after, the change appeared to be reverted and the feed went back to normal.

The alteration was just intended as a test, he said, giving no indication that it would be rolling out widely and properly any time in the near future.An Instagram statement suggested the change was a bug, rather than an accident, but both Mr Mosseri and the company\u0027s spokespeople were presumably referring to the same incident.“Due to a bug, some users saw a change to the way their feed appears today, the\u0026nbspstatement read.\u0026nbspWe quickly fixed the issue and feed is back to normal. We apologise for any confusion.Confusion as new Instagram appears and disappearsMr Mosseri only recently took up his position as Instagram’s boss, though he has worked for a long time at Facebook, most recently as the head of its News Feed. He was moved into his new\u0026nbsprole after Instagram’s founders left the company, reportedly in the wake of disagreements over its future direction.The roll-out of the change to the feed had already appeared strange: Instagram does usually allow small groups of people to test out new features, before slowly rolling them out to everyone who uses it. But this time around the update appeared to arrive on everyone’s phone all at once, dropping rapidly on Thursday afternoon UK time.When the change happened, it came with a screen that explained why it had arrived and how to use it. That suggested the change was not the result of a bug or that it had happened by accident, but presumably the same screen was only meant to be seen by the small number of people who would get access to the altered feed.Soon after, the new feed started reverting back to normal, before Instagram chose to announce that the update had been a mistake.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":null,"title":"instagram update new scroll left right sideways feature explained","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

For the moment, a new battery costs only £25 – but once the new year arrives, that will rocket up to as much as £65.Old batteries can cause significant problems for their owners as iPhones age. With use, the power begins to drop – something that can lead to phones lasting for much less time, and to Apple having to slow down phones to ensure that they don\u0027t crash because they\u0027re not getting enough power.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIt was the revelation that Apple was doing that – throttling performance on older phones, in line with more spectacular rumours that swirled before it was admitted – that led to the cheap repairs in the first place.When that story came out over the Christmas period in 2017, Apple apologised and said that as part of a range of ways of making it up to customers it would knock down the price of replacements, allowing people to restore their phone\u0027s performance if their battery had been degraded.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

Once the programme is over, the same service will cost £45 for most phones, and a full £65 for the iPhone X.Apple gives governments increased access to phone dataThe iPhone X recently became eligible for the throttling, which Apple still applies to more strained batteries to ensure they perform properly. One of the other forms of restitution offered to users was the option to turn that off, which can be found in Settings.Phones that are covered by its warranty period or extended AppleCare coverage will remain free, as they always have been.As the end of the year approaches, Apple Stores appear to be especially busy with users rushing to take advantage of the offer. Genius Bar appointments can be few and far between, though some customers have had success turning up at stores.The replacements require that a battery is sufficiently degraded, which will be checked by Geniuses at the store but can be seen by heading to the Battery options in the Settings app. But some customers appear to have successfully had batteries that are not under the critical 80 per cent mark swapped out all the same.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/01/20/instagram.jpg","title":"new instagram update revert back scrolling swipe left feed change feature","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Just go to your profile, hit the three dots at the top and select Posts You’ve Liked. You can also save posts in a folder only you can see by tapping the bookmark icon underneath it. Take a look at everything you’ve bookmarked by tapping the same icon that sits near the top of your profile.Everyone knows you can expand the reach of your posts by using a number of relevant hashtags, but what those are aren’t always glaringly obvious. You can easily find the right ones for you by typing a keyword into Instagram’s search bar, selecting a hashtag from the list and swiping along the Related row that appears at the top of the screen.611 Clear your search historyWhatever your reasons are, you can clear your recent searches by going to your profile, hitting the three dots in the top right and selecting Clear Search History. To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon.

Go to your profile, tap the three dots, open Two-Factor Authentication and toggle it on.911 Share lots at onceIf you want to upload a bunch of related pictures and videos without flooding everyone else’s feed, you can shared them all as one post. Hit the + icon, select Gallery, choose Select Multiple, pick out up to 10 of the pictures and clips you want, tap Next and reorder them by dragging and dropping.Instagram Stories has been a massive hit since it came out last year, but you might not know that you can record Stories clips without having to hold one of your digits on the record key. On the Stores screen, just swipe through the options at the bottom until you get to Hands-Free. Most people know you can delete any of the images you’ve already posted, but not everyone is aware that you can also edit them. Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  This time around, almost everyone got the update within a matter of minutes. If people weren\u0027t seeing it when they opened their app, force quitting and scrolling around appeared to prompt the app to update.Why Instagram just completely changed its feedBut now some users report that the change has switched back, with the feed going upright all over again. It\u0027s not clear whether that is a bug – or whether the rollout itself had happened by accident, or early.Instagram had clearly meant for the update to go live at some point, since an instructional card popped up to explain that the change had been made and what users now had to do.There doesn\u0027t appear to be any way to make the feed change back. Instagram is not giving the option to revert to the old feed, even temporarily.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/samsung-galaxy-s10-leak-camera.jpg  width= 1254  height= 836  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/samsung-galaxy-s10-leak-camera.jpg","title":"samsung galaxy s10 release date price camera specs camera screen leaks","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

Everything up until now – the endless disputes, crises and resignations, the huge cost, both in gold and other reforms forgone, are just a prelude for the tougher task ahead.If the UK leaves the EU this year, it will do so with no blueprint for its future trading terms, after Brussels comprehensively torched the Chequers plan in September.To give one example of the tortures ahead, the Commons would have to decide, in the summer of 2020, whether to implement the Irish border backstop the following January – the key controversy currently obsessing MPs.Created with Sketch.

We’ve just accomplished the most distant flyby.”Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said: “In addition to being the first to explore Pluto, today New Horizons flew by the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft and became the first to directly explore an object that holds remnants from the birth of our solar system.“This is what leadership in space exploration is all about.”The radio message from the robotic craft was picked up in Madrid by one of Nasa’s big antennas. The data took six hours and eight minutes to traverse the massive breadth of space between Ultima and Earth.According to Nasa, scientists had not discovered Ultima Thule when the probe was launched in 2006, meaning the mission was unique. In 2014, astronomers found Thule using the Hubble Space Telescope and selected it for New Horizon’s extended mission in 2015. “Anything’s possible out there in this very unknown region,” said John Spencer, deputy project scientist for New Horizons. Launched in January 2006, New Horizons embarked on a 4 billion mile journey towards the solar system’s frigid edge to study the dwarf planet Pluto and its five moons. The spacecraft, which is the size of a baby grand piano, flew past Pluto in 2015, providing the first close-up views of the planet. During the flyby, the probe found Pluto to be slightly larger than previously thought. In March, it revealed that methane-rich dunes were on the icy dwarf planet’s surface.After trekking 1 billion miles beyond Pluto into the Kuiper belt, New Horizons will now seek clues about the formation of the solar system and its planets.There is a great deal scientists can learn from Ultima and the hundreds of thousands of similar bodies scientists deem to be in the solar system. Hal Weaver, project scientist on the mission, told the BBC the rock is “probably the most primitive object ever encountered by a spacecraft, the best possible relic of the early solar system”. The object is officially known as 2014 MU69, but was nicknamed Ultima Thule, a Latin phrase which means “beyond the borders of the known world”.Additional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Every word of his tweet was correct — these men are sick, they are paedophiles and they are Asian.When politicians are condemned for telling the truth, for stating plain-as-day facts, you know we live in scarily censorious times.So, this week, Javid was right to turn down an invitation to “rethink” his October tweet.He was on the Today programme on Radio . A guest presenter — the British-Pakistani novelist Kamila Shamsie — asked himhe thought his tweet might have fuelled hate crimes. Coolly, and with rare principle, Javid said that of course politicians must be “careful with their language”.Butyou look at recent high-profile cases of gang-based sexual exploitation, “there is a high proportion of men that have Pakistani heritage”, he said.He’s right.Rotherham, Oxford, Rochdale, Derby, Telford, Newcastle, Huddersfield . . . across England there have been awful grooming-gang cases, where the perpetrators have largely been Muslim men and the victims white working-class girls.We must be free to talk about this. To analyse it. To ask how such a terrible situation came about where vulnerable, mostly white girls are preyed upon by wicked, mainly Muslim men.But we are not free to talk about it. Anybody who raises the issue of Muslim grooming gangs risks being branded as foul, a racist, a troublemaker whose words will fuel hate crimes.Indeed, Javid has been subjected to genuine racist abuse for speaking out on the issue.Vile, hard-left tweeters have denounced him as an “Uncle Tom” and a “coconut”.Such disgusting racist insults reveal where the real prejudice lies in this debate — not in Javid’s concerned comments, but in the PC outrage that effectively says to him: “Shut up, Coconut.” Javid was not being prejudiced but many of the supposed progressives raging against him have been.It is all a sign of the times. From Conservatives such as Javid, to Labour MP Sarah Champion and radical feminists such as Julie Bindel, anyone who expresses concern about Pakistani-heritage grooming gangs can expect to be bombarded with abuse.But a nation that cannot discuss its communal tensions is a nation that is in very serious trouble.That signicant numbers of Muslim men are abusing signicant numbers of white working-class girls suggests “multicultural Britain” is a fractured, sometimes ugly place — and we must be at liberty to talk about this.Shushing debate about Muslim grooming gangs is insulting not only to the victims of those gangs, but to Britain’s Muslim community, too.It suggests they are too fragile, too weak, to cope with honest debate about problems and crimes within their communities.So let us be thankful for Sajid Javid — a politician who is willing to look modern Britain in the face and ask it some dficult but essential questions.This is a Tory to watch.Their latest wheeze is to force restaurants and supermarkets to impose “calorie caps” on their dishes.Public Health England is thinking about stopping supermarkets from selling sarnies that have more than  calories and capping restaurant meals at  calories. This would effectively mean using the power of the state to force us slovenly, greedy plebs to go on diets.It’s so paternalistic.Here’s a radical idea – bugger off and let people eat whatever they want.Our lunchtime triple-decker sandwich and occasional restaurant blowout are none of your business.TALK about a self-fulfilling prophecy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our proposed solutions have been on the table for months.”The former Luxembourg PM added: “I have the impression that the majority of British MPs deeply distrust both the EU and Mrs May.“It is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means. That is not our intention.”Hitting back last night, a No source said: “What does he hope to achieve by saying this  I don’t know whose interests that serves”.Tory MP Nigel Huddleston dubbed it “not particularly useful or helpful language”, adding: “It is inappropriate but not surprising, as he is under pressure from European businesses to produce a deal as well”.Mrs May has been told by Tories and the DUP to seek legally binding assurances that the backstop that keeps Britain in the customs union will be time-limited.One senior aide to the PM last week dubbed Mr Juncker the UK’s “best hope” of finding a fix as he was “put on this earth to negotiate”.The new row came as International Trade Secretary Liam Fox yesterday warned that the chances of Britain leaving the EU would be down to  Mrs May’s deal is voted down in two weeks time.It also emerged that senior Tory and Labour MPs are planning to force the government to delay Brexit by three monthsthe Commons throws out the deal.It was claimed that cross-party talks have been underway for several weeks to ensure the March  date is put back until July in a bid to win the government more time.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn today accuses Theresa May and her ministers of tipping Britain “into crisis” for leaving the country with no deal with the EU in place with just  days to go today until Brexit takes place.In his New Year message, the Opposition boss attacked the Tories for “the complete mess they’ve made of Brexit, trying to drive through a bad deal and letting people down all across the country whether they voted leave or remain.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

they kept backing up.It is a health hazard not just for the drivers but also people walking down the road.Shopper Jane Meadows, , said: It was absolutely disgusting.Id driven to Aldi to pick up a few bits and bobs for a New Years Eve buffet but I had to drive straight out the car park because I was gagging at the smell.It comes to something when you have to cross a river of poo to reach the supermarket.A spokesperson for Severn Trent said: We were made aware of a potentially burst sewer late on Monday morning and we sent out a team as a priority.There is nothing to do with a burst sewage pipe, it was blocked by a fat and wipes.Severn Trent Water has assessed the main drain pipe and need a heavy jetting machine which has been ordered and the blockage will be cleared up."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000458439247.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may eu leaders brexit deal","story":"The PM has admitted she has “work to do” to get the withdrawal agreement through Parliament next month.She is spending this week phoning European leaders asking them to sign off on changes to the deal which will ensure the hated “Irish backstop” doesn’t tie Britain to the EU forever.Mrs May is counting on securing a legal assurance that the backstop would be time-limitedit ever came into force.Otherwise, the UK would risk being permanently trapped in the customs union -

About time too. But still, it’s progress.And there is no doubt that ­attitudes to women are changing.We’ve got a second female Prime ­Minister and a female playing the lead in Doctor Who.And women are rising up. We are organising, ­protesting, shaming and building power.We are making the women’s movement central to everyone’s conversation. Women are finding their voice.And the most important thing is we are getting heard.We are not going to accept mansplaining or being ­spoken down to “stupid woman”.Feminism is the word of the year, with more and more women standing up for themselves and demanding equality, and I predict that process is going to continue in .Now that I think about it, there were other good things about .It was the year we rediscovered hope in football during the World Cup.We did better than we thought we would — and it’s not often we can say that.The England team and manager Gareth Southgate restored our ­national self-esteem and gave us something to cheer about when there really was not much .The World Cup showed us nice guys can win.Sure, we didn’t bring home the trophy but it’s fair to say Gareth Southgate’s a winner in everyone’s eyes.And it’s not over yet:  is the women’s football World Cup — so that’s something to look forward to with hope.Hope is an important word. And now, more than ever, we need to find a way to hang on to the things that make us feel optimistic about the future.There were other hopeful things about .This was the year that gave us the breath of fresh air that is Meghan Markle — and it also saw the most stylish royal wedding this country has probably ever seen.Meghan was a signier of change for the Royal Family, which needed to modernise.And while I know some people have decided she is “pushy”, or criticise her for her relationship with her father, I think Meghan is one of the best things that has ever happened to our royals.We also had a royal baby — Prince Louis — and now we have another one on the way, which is happy news.My personal highlight of  was having lunch at Buckingham Palace with the Queen.It really was a wonderful occasion, spending intimate time talking to such an inspiring woman.And now here we are, poised on the brink of .I’m not a New Year’s Eve ­person.

Go on, W, give it another series . . .So bad it was bad award: An ITV aberration, “set in an abandoned zoo”, featuring Towie gimps and gorilla suits, called Evil Monkeys. More crystal meth than Crystal Maze.Seance of the year:  Star’s Celebrity Ghost Hunt marks  years of women’s suffrage by attempting to contact Margaret Thatcher, in a disused Essex nuclear bunker.Towie’s Bobby Cole Norris: “Margaret, please give us a signthere’s anyone there.” Deathly silence. Geordie Shore’s Marnie Simpson: “Who’s Margaret Thatcher ”Worst sitcom: John Cleese’s Hold The Sunset. And now for something completely indferent . . .Worst reality TV update: ITV’s Love Island rip-off Survival Of The Fittest: “Everyone’s cleaning their teeth and getting ready for an early night.” Stay tuned, folks!Fantasist of the year: In a class of her own, former Emmerdale star Roxanne Pallett who marked September by leaving Celebrity Big Brother in disgrace, after accusing Ryan Thomas of a non-existent assault, then fled Bear Grylls’ Celebrity Island, due to fire-related memories, before quitting Celebrity Ghost Hunt, for reasons too traumatic to reveal.Best sporting insight farewell: Arsene Wenger: “I’d like to finish with one simple word, I will miss you.”Best Commonwealth Games quote: Paralympian Jonnie Peacock: “If you fail a drug test, you haven’t got a leg to stand on.”Criminal pathologist of the year: Meet The Drug Lords: Inside The Real Narcos, Jason “Foxy” Fox: “He’s had his head and both arms cut off.

More of this, please.Worst comedy: Dishonourable mentions for Famalam, The Last Leg, Have I Got News For You, Channel ’s “feminist comedy” Riot Girls, The Mash Report and all those other satirical shows that thought spewing vile, left-wing propaganda was more important than making the viewers laugh.With the absolute worst of them being BBC’s Frankie Boyle’s New World Order. Less of this, please.This Mornings guest of the year: Kirsty Wright, whose proud boast is: “I can lt a can of beans with my vagina,” and will be a shoo-in for Britain’s Got Talent she can learn to open them as well.Worst drama: Equally solid claims here for the all-new preachy, right-on Doctor Who, The Little Drummer Girl, Wanderlust, Hard Sun, The Split, Age Before Beauty,Strangers, Press and Collateral, with the character Viz comic forgot, DI Kip Glaspie, the pole-vaulting policewoman.But the worst of the lot was unquestionably BBC’s big budget bollo Troy: Fall Of A City, which really should be in the comedy section as it made me laugh so hard and was, apparently “based on the works of Homer”.

Sadiq Khan, who wants a second referendum instead of crashing out of the EU in , said the Tories had made a mess of Brexit as he staged the show just metres from the Houses of Parliament. The phrase London is open was spoken in Spanish, Polish, French, Romanian, German and Italian as the pound.m taxpayer-funded fireworks kicked off in the capital, which voted % to remain in . And the London Eye was lit up to resemble an EU flag as the song There For You, by drum and bass artist Culture Shock, rang out. Furious Brexiteers accused him of politicising a public-funded event - but Mr Khan today defended the spectacular fireworks, saying they showed that whatever the outcome of Brexit London is open.  Some , ticket-holders lined the banks of the Thames to watch , projectiles made up of eight tonnes of fireworks fire into the sky from three barges and the London Eye. We Are Your Friends, Stay and Dont Leave Me Alone were among songs chosen for the -minute soundtrack, which featured artists from Ireland, France, Sweden and where. Mr Khan said he hoped this years event would demonstrate Londons relationship with Europe, and send a message of support to more than one million European citizens for whom the capital is home.  And he claimed the display would show Europe that the capital will remain open-minded and outward looking post-Brexit. The display was allocated pound.million from the Greater London Authoritys budget.  A further pound, was expected to be raised in sales of pound-a-head tickets and concessions. Officials estimated ticket holders would bring a pound.million economic benefit to London. It came as Theresa May used her New Year message to launch a desperate plea for MPs to back her Brexit deal.  Commons leader Andrea Leadsom today accepted many will call for a second EU referendumthe deal fails in a vote from January . But said she will fight tooth and nail against a so-called Peoples Vote. The people spoke in , and Parliament must deliver, she wrote in the Daily Mail.  The challenge by a London mayor to a Tory PM echoes the s, when the Greater London Councils Ken Livingstone opposed Margaret Thatchers policies across the river from the Houses of Parliament. It also recalls s State Opening of Parliament in which the Queen wore a hat many interpreted as a subtle nod to the EU flag.  Speaking just before the display, Mr Khan said: One of the things which upset many, many Londoners and many people across our country and in Europe is the tone and language used by politicians in Westminster, giving the impression were insular, inward looking, not welcoming to Europeans. I think the Governments made a mess of negotiations with the European Union.  Bearing in mind Parliament cant resolve the issue of how we will leave the European Union, we should allow the public to take back control with the option of staying in European Union, or accepting the deal made by the government. The pro-EU symbolism enraged Brexiteers, who complained the mayor was politicising an event funded by taxpayers. Trump supporter Pat Condell complained this shallow little man can’t get anything right while Tory Andrew Bridgen said the mayor was politicising an international public event in a betrayal of democracy. But not everyone was hung up on the politics. Brexit Minister Chris Heaton-Harris tweeted: Amazing Fireworks London! Thank you! Have an awesome  everyone!

A study of , adults shows the majority of us won’t start ing properly until almost a full working week has passed. Re-adjusting to early mornings, the mountain of work which has piled up over the festive break and having to deal with challenging clients all take their toll in early January. Others find it hard to get in the mood for exercise, knowing when they do go to the gym it will be packed with people on a New Year fitness kick. The study, commissioned by working animal charity SPANA, found for one in six Brits, the feeling of having nothing to look forward to also means they struggle to get back into their normal routine. Geoffrey Dennis, chief executive of SPANA, which provides free veterinary treatment to working animals in developing countries around the world, said: “Going back to work after time off can be a shock to the system – especially after a sustained period of parties, lie-ins and relaxation.  “However, most of us are fortunate to be ing to jobs that we feel comfortable in, with decent colleagues and reasonable working conditions. As the holiday hangovers kick in, it’s important to keep some perspective and remember that our working lives could be unimaginably worse. The study found  per cent of adults reckon they suffer from the January blues, and  per cent said that during the early part of the month, they’ll only be at work in body, but not in mind. Three in  workers said they’re fully expecting work to be awful in January because they know they can’t have any time off for a while, while a fth said they’re likely toto a big work load. And a quarter are not looking forward to the likelihood that everyone  will be miserable about theto work. Perhaps unsurprisingly, more than a fth of adults have considered calling in sick for the first few days back to work, while more than half are expecting to feel sad the evening before their first day. Researchers also found almost half of those polled have no intentions of making any social arrangements in January. When asked why,  per cent said they would be too grumpy, while a third say they’ll have no money. A lack of cash also means Brits are unlikely to go shopping in the January sales, and won’t do anything of any interest until the first pay day of .  The fact there are still months left of winter to go, feeling tired and sluggish and having to endure rubbish television are other major reasons adults find January a chore. Brits also don’t like the fact social media is full of weight loss plans they can’t relate to, and everyone is doing dry January. Dennis added: “It’s a very dferent story for working animals overseas. These animals have no holiday or retirement. Day-in, day-out, they work in punishing environments, carrying backbreaking loads, often without the rest, water and vital veterinary care they need.” “Working horses, donkeys, camels and other animals in developing countries often endure short, painful lives, in brutal conditions. This global workforce of  million animals must work every day to help their owners earn a small income and put food on the table. Without these hardworking animals, many of the world’s poorest communities would have nothing. “These animals are unsung heroes, but they desperately need our help. That’s why SPANA’s work is important – ensuring that the welfare of working animals is improved and that they receive the veterinary treatment they urgently require when they are sick or injured.” TOP  REASONS BRITS STRUGGLE TO GET BACK IN THE SADDLE . The weather is horrible. The days are still short and dark. There are still months left of winter to go. You feel tired and sluggish. January feels like the longest month of the year. The excitement of Christmas has passed. Re-adjusting to the boring routine of everyday le   the daily grind. Feels like ages before you will have any time off work again. You feel like theres nothing to look forward to. You find it hard to motivate yourself to do any exercise. You have eaten so much over Christmas you find it hard to stop. The TV is rubbish. You cant do anything of interest until January pay day. Youve picked up an illness after Christmas. You can no longer blame the holidays for eating drinking too much. All the work you said youll get back to after Christmas is too much. You cant be bothered to take the tree decorations down  . January sales means you want to spend more money - but then you realise Christmas has left you broke, so youre depressed again. You feel like youve socialised enough over the Christmas period to last a letime - hence seeing any more people is just effort. Clients and customers are a challenge to work with. The gym is packed with people on a new year fitness kick. Kids are also struggling to get back into routine. Everyone  seems to be back on it, but you arent quite ready. Social media is full of weight loss plans and New Years resolutions that you cant relate to. No point in going out - as everyone is doing dry January. Your house is full of Christmas presents - many of which are unwanted. You start to experience chocolate withdrawal symptoms. Kids are a nightmare because theyve been spoiled over Christmas. Kids have got used to late nights and late mornings which means getting them ready for school is even harder.

The Albion in Grimsby was once a thriving watering hole which was popular with the towns dock workers before closing eight years ago. But shocking new pictures show how the pub has become den for hardcore drug users after falling into disrepair. Stacks of used needles lie strewn across the tables where drinkers used to sit and chat, GrimsbyLive reported . The core of the pub is still recognisable as the furniture and ornate features remain intact but the onslaught of unwanted visitors has now taken its toll after nearly a decade of neglect.   Intruders have broken makesht holes through the roof and have have ripped up the floorboards in search valuable copper. The building itself now faces the wrecking ball as the once-grand Edwardian structure continues to rot. The pubs owner, Surrinder Mehat, says he feels he has no option but to tear it down and start from scratch. Architect Terry Litten risked his le detailing the state of building ahead of a new planning application to replace it with a three-storey-block of flats.   I have been in the business  years and I have never seen a building as drug infested as that, he told Grimsby Live after his brave venture inside. I could get a bath full of needles. Not a bag full, a bath full. I am being dead serious. His photos show chunks of plaster are splattered across the carpet.  More dangerous items such as discarded needles of almost every colour pile high on windowsills and are in hidden cracks and crevices. Doors have been stripped off their hinges to become beds while a Heinz Beanz tin, a scrunched up box of Kellogs Cornflakes and a bottle of Tesco Everyday Coke provide evidence of recent break-ins. I didnt want to stand in there long because half the floor was missing, said Mr Litten.  Theres only very few bits of floor left. They lted all that to get the copper wire. They were sleeping on the floor or on doors they had take off the hinges. They had broken in through the roof in some cases. He added: You just cant keep them out. My client lives away. Theres just no way he can deal with it.  Its a wonder no one has got killed, especially when they will be walking round half cut. An application to demolish the pub and build eight flats on the site is pending consideration by the local council. A final decision is expected in January.  The developer states the serious risk posed by the condition of the property prevents a detailed inspection of the its historical features. He added that the loss of the building would be an enhancement to the area as a whole.

Dean Lovell-Payne, , who was incapacitated by a fall this summer, took a massive overdose in September  after having to endure almost three months without receiving any benefits at all. Now Dean, his partner Paula and their three children Andrew, , Lou, , and Phoebe, , have been forced to move into a house in woods on the outskirts of Bournemouth which is only accessible by a dirt track, meaning wheelchair-bound Dean is effectively housebound. Despite pleading with the Universal Credit helpline, after the -week payment delay Dean said he felt he had no option but to take his own le during the call as he thought his le insurance would pay out more quickly. He received his benefits the same day after police are believed to have alerted the DWP to the incident and a spokesman for the DWP said they ‘sympathised with the distress he felt’. Do you have a Universal Credit story  Get in touch webnews@trinitymirror   The former ambulance worker, from Poole, Dorset, said: “Each and every day is horrendous. “I realised it was utterly hopeless and that my le insurance would be more likely to pay out in time to help my family than Universal Credit was. “I thought it was my only option to stop them suffering. “I took an overdose. “I didn’t even hang-up the phone. I told the soulless b*****d exactly what I was doing. “It seemed like the only way my family would be safe and no longer suffering, the only end to the hardship and insecurity. “The next thing I knew the police and ambulance arrived. “I survived the overdose because I had tolerance to the painkillers and sleeping tablets I had taken, by luck more than judgement. “But I am not the same person. I’m anxious, fearful and distrusting of anyone in the benefits system. “Although I survived, I don’t see much of a future for myself.”   Dean has been on benefits since  after he developed sepsis and global nerve and joint pain following an operation. Despite his health improving and being able to work part-time with the ambulance service, he suffered a major fall and subsequent infection in June which prevented him from walking. Forced to move to a cheaper home, Dean applied for Universal Credit the same month. But he said their new house, which is a converted motel in isolated woodland outside Bournemouth near Ringwood, Dorset, is totally inadequate for he and his family to live in. Dean said: “The access to the house is terrible. “It’s just gravel tracks and sometimes I feel like a prisoner in here. The house is very, very cold in the winter too. “Half the month we don’t have any heating because we can’t afford to heat the house.” But after going through the necessary checks, Dean was told that he would have to wait five weeks for the payment to be processed. He claims the delay of  weeks in total meant he and Paula came close to being forced to put their children into care and meant that they extinguished any meagre savings the couple had.   He said: “Five weeks came and went. We waited and waited and were reaching crunch time. “Our money had long since run out and the end of the school holidays meant the knock-on effects of no universal credit were going to bite. “Without confirmed Universal Credit we could not get our kids to school, could not sort out their free school meals or feed them at home. “We also had letters from council tax demanding money. “We couldn’t get my prescriptions either all of our standing orders were set to bounce within days. “The only safety net I had left for my family was my le insurance.” Dean said that although he survived his overdose, his le has not improved. He added: “I struggle out of bed in the morning to take my daughter to school and then get back into bed. “I’ve worked all my le but am made to feel like I’m worthless just because I’m too sick to work. “I feel helpless. There doesn’t seem to be anywhere to turn.”   Paula, who is Dean’s full-time carer and has to carry him to the car daily so he can drive his daughter to school, said: “I dont know from one day to the nextwe can get my daughter to school or not. “Were supposed to provide for our family but we cant. I watch Dean struggle day to day and its terrible. “I feel like a failure as a mother because we cant do the things for our kids that were supposed to. A DWP spokesperson said: “We sympathise with the distress Mr Lovell-Payne felt. “Jobcentre staff handled his claim sensitively and in line with their duty of care. “A Universal Credit payment was made as soon as Mr Lovell-Payne’s claim had been properly veried.”   THE FAMILYS INCOMINGS: pound Universal Credit pound PIP pound Carer AllowanceTOTAL  pound THE FAMILYS OUTGOINGS: pound rent pound direct debitspound electricity pound coal pound gas pound Iceland shop pound for daughters’ travel TOTAL  pound DISCREPANCY  -pound, Dean spends on his credit card monthly to make up the dference and cover petrol and any other unexpected expenses.

Norah Gibson, , never knew her birth mother because she was given up for adoption as a newborn back in . She spent  years trying to track down her biological mother. She grew up in a loving home and did not want to upset her adoptive parents by trying to trace her other family.But when her adoptive father John Gibson died in , she began her search in earnest. Grandmother-of-five Norah was finally able to get in touch with her birth mother, Rita Campbell, now aged , after a TV production company helped with her research. Two years ago, Rita travelled all the way from Canada to Scotland to meet her illegitimate daughter and they were reunited at Glasgow Airport. Norah, from Dumbarton, West Dunbartonshire said: My mother was unmarried when she had me, and her parents took control.She never had a say in the matter.Care worker Norah was inspired to seek out her birth mother after being told by a guest at her own wedding Your mother would be very proud of you. The glamorous bride was aged  when she wed ex-husband Kenneth McMaster and was shocked when her ancestry was mentioned.But with the demands of raising four children, Andrew, Gregor, Ross and Lesley, and the tragic loss of her first child, Kenneth, her intentions of tracking down the woman who gave birth to her fell by the wayside.And Norah was afraid of upsetting her adoptive parents John and his second we, Peggy, who he married after the death of his first we, also named Norah.She described the couple as exceptional and loving.After their deaths, she trawled through records in Edinburgh and discovered that when she was born, the name given to her was Anne.Her mothers name was listed as Margaret Campbell, who lived at  Duntocher Road, Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire.Determined Norah pulled up the addresses of people named Margaret Campbell who still lived in the neighbourhood, but drew only blanks.She knocked on doors in the area but to no avail.Unbeknown to her, Margaret Campbell was known as Rita - and was living on the other side of the world, in Canada. They were reunited with the help of television producers and began to exchange letters - eventually speaking for the first time on Mothers Day.Norah said: We look alike, we think alike - it is so similar, its uncanny.My mum kept her secret all her le, there was only one of her brothers who knew.Their initial letters were short and pragmatic, addressing medical history. I think she was in shock and couldnt quite believe it, she added. It was the most surreal feeling.Norah learnt that she had a half-brother, Ian Fair, and got in touch with him too.And in November , Rita and Ian flew to Scotland to be reunited with their long-lost relative.As she waited at Glasgow Airport, Norah began to fear they had had a change of heart.But when tiny Rita, who stands at only ftins tall, walked through the arrivals hall she flung her arms around her daughter and told her here I am. For the first time in  years, mother and daughter were able to embrace - as when the baby was born, she had been taken away from Rita immediately.Norah said: Her hands were tied, she didnt have any part in the decision.She literally saw me being taken out of the room.Poignantly, they visited the building where Norah had been born in Dumbarton - dubbed by her mother as the scene of the crime.Over a two-week period, elderly Rita showed Norah the sights of Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, where she had spent her youth.Norah said: Id been looking for more than  years and got nowhere. I never wanted to give up looking for her.I looked in records in Clydebank Town Hall and in Edinburgh, but all I had was her name and address, I didnt know she was using the name Rita.Shes just amazing, shes a lovely wee person.In October this year, Norah flew to Canada to meet her second family - and met the huge Campbell clan in their hometown, Campbellford, Ontario.She spent Thanksgiving with them and says she has a lot to be grateful for - including the love and affection shown to her by the family who raised her after she was adopted in .Norah added: Im eternally grateful - I told her  it wasnt for you, I wouldnt have my five grandchildren.She created all these lives by going through what she did.I had to say that to her."},{"url":null,"title":"young mum returns home find","story":"NewsYoung mum s home to find family dog stabbed to death in her own kitchenSophie Davison, , had left her home in Sunderland at around midday on Saturday, before ing just before pm to feed Pippin, her -year-old Yorkshire TerrierShareCommentsByAbigail OLearyChris Knight:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsSophie Davison with her son Jensen \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA horried young mum ed home to find her family dog stabbed to death in her own kitchen.

I just froze and had to ring my mum to come over and check I wasnt overthinking it. Sophie described Pippin as the perfect pet, adding: Pippin was the healthiest and most friendly dog. He loved our family and would never harm anyone. The mum-of-one has only lived in the street for around three months, but said she no longer feels safe in her own home.  Sophie added: I dont know any of my neighbours and dont have any bother with anyone. “Tia is scared to go outside. “Im looking to move. The killer has been in my property and could do it again. Sophies sister Viki has made a Facebook appeal in a bid to track down the twisted killer. Northumbria Police confirmed an investigation into Pippins stabbing is under way.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

The transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion.

It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"community-rallies-to-support-the-family-of-amanda-cox","story":"A HUGE community effort to support the family of Amanda Cox will continue this evening.The

cover the funeral costs as well as provide ongoing support for Michael as he travels daily to be with his new-born son in hospital.John admits everyone has been overwhelmed by the level of generosity shown.He told us: \"I started the fundraising page just to help a mate out.\"The cost of raising a child can be tough with two wages coming in and now itrsquos just Michaels wage.\"Now with everything  that he has to think about I just wanted to try and take a tiny bit of a weight off him.\"I thought setting this up I could maybe raise two or three thousand to help out with Amandarsquos funeral, or for anything he needed it for.\"Irsquom absolutely stunned and delighted it was so well received by local people and beyond.\"The gofundme page raised more than the pound, target within the first  hours of being set up.And throughout the weekend and into this week donations have continued to flow in for the grieving family.A special fundraiser will also be held in Michaels hometown of Innerleithen this evening.Staff at the St Ronans Hotel were planning to host a festive disco, but the tragic news of Amandas death pulled the night in a dferent direction.Paul Morgan of the St Ronans Hotel explained: \"Two of our regulars who worked alongside Amanda at Haylodge Health Centre were in on Sunday.\"We were chatting about the fundraising page set up by John Clarkson, which has raised a phenomenal amount of money to help support Michael and his son Murray.\"The idea for this event came about as there were some unclaimed raffle prizes from the Lights Switch On, so we decided to re-raffle them and put funds towards supporting Amandas family.\"But it has grown massively this week. The response from businesses in Peebles and Innerleithen has been incredible.\"We have received over  donations and prizes are still rolling in.\"The communities have really come together to do what they can to support the family at this sad time.

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty. Granted, it is a small liberty, but it must be treated with utmost care and consideration.ldquoWe need to have a real and considered debate before deciding on this. One of the endearing things about the Europeans, and I say this as a Brexiteer, is their cafe culture. This type of activity would be forbidden in places like Jedburgh.ldquoWhen a family goes to the park for a picnic, and brings a bottle of wine, they are now caught in the battle between over-legislation and common sense.ldquoI would say letrsquos encourage cafe lestyle, and its economic potential for increasing footfall and destination desirability.Although councillor Hamiltonrsquos motion was defeated by  votes to seven, councillors decided not to submit their by-laws to the Scottish Government and instead opted for more research into the potential benefits and disadvantages and for further public consultation."},{"url":null,"title":"make-a-date-with-sinatra-and-crosby-this-christmas-in-selkirk","story":"THERES a chance to swing your way into Christmas this weekend in Selkirk with some of the best-known festive hits.Christmas Crooners is coming to Victoria Halls on Sunday as part of their UK tour, now in its tenth record-breaking year.The show features the renowned West-End Singers performing the famous Christmas hits of all the greats, including Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Nat King Cole.They will be showcasing over  of the best-loved festive tunes, such as lsquoDeck the Hallsrsquo, lsquoChestnuts Roastingrsquo and lsquoSanta Babyrsquo, bringing some old-school Christmas glamour to the Borders.Stephen Leatherland, producer and director of the show, said: ldquoIrsquom delighted to be bringing Christmas Crooners to Selkirk and the Border region.\"This fantastic show has brought joy to many people over the last ten years and more, and we look forward to bringing a parcel of Christmas Magic to Selkirk ndash the perfect start to the festive season for young and old alike.Staged in the warm style of the famous Andy Williams Christmas Shows, this production comes complete with Christmas trees, a rocking chair and fireplace.Christmas Crooners is a community-minded event that will bring people together in the local town hall over the Christmas period to celebrate all things festive, with top-quality musicians performing Christmas classics.Hamish Moir, events and programming officer for Live Borders, said: ldquoI canrsquot think of a better way to celebrate the festive season than by heading to the local town hall for an evening of recreating the biggest Christmas hits.\"The Christmas Crooners put on a top quality performance with the West-End singers and Jazz-All-Stars, and we canrsquot wait for them to come to Selkirk for a cosy evening of live music.ldquoWe have a great series of events running over Christmas and in  that would make great gts, and I recommend looking at our website to view the full programme.\"At Live Borders we want to help make communities healthier, happier and stronger, especially at Christmas time, so come and join us on December  for these feel-good hits.Christmas Crooners will be performing in Victoria Halls, Selkirk, on Sunday at :.Tickets, priced at pound., are still available from www.eventbrite or by calling  ."},{"url":null,"title":"council-accused-of-paying-over-the-odds-for-lowood-estate","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has been told ldquoit may come to regret its decision to buy what remains of the Lowood Estate after it was revealed that government valuers advised the authority it would be paying over the odds.The council has spent pound.m on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.Council officers believe that the site, as part of a wider Tweedbank development plan, will create  permanent jobs, and a similar number during the construction phase.The site has also been earmarked for a -home housing estate.At a full meeting of the council yesterday, December , its executive member for business and economic development, Mid-Berwickshire councillor Mark Rowley, told members: ldquoThis was a project set in motion by a previous council.ldquoIn , the previous council agreed to the purchase of Lowood in principle, and over the last few years, work has been developing on this.ldquoWhat makes this incredibly important, probably more important than it was in , is that with all the talk around budgets, the council can no longer just sit back and try to carry on carrying out services.ldquoWe need to take decisive and strategic action, and this is an incredibly bold, and good, large-scale development.ldquoItrsquos maximising benefits wersquore already seeing with the Borders Railway. It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

curriculums independent of each other.A recent inspection by Education Scotland found a gap in the literacy and numeracy performance of children coming into P.The new school will follow a single

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming.

Also, let us not forget the entrenched position of the British Establishment to avoid PR, devolution ndash and federalism ndash in the UK.If, however, the authorrsquos main point was that England isnrsquot so dferent to Scotland, I would suggest that the article very clearly outlined signicant dferences which contradicted this assertion.First, in marked contrast to England, the leadership of all political parties in Scotland were united against Brexit ndash surely, a huge dference to be noted. Indeed, one of the most excruciating sights of the last two years has been to see Labour and Conservative politicians changing direction like little flags in the wind, as their English leaders have switched their Brexit policies from soft to hard to no-deal and back again.Secondly, the rural metropolitan split in Englandrsquos Brexit vote was stark, whereas the vote in Scotland was unormly Remain ndash we all remember that map ndash whether considered in terms of rural metropolitan, or north south, or even island mainland, for that matter.In summary, I would suggest that the conduct of the Brexit campaign, the result, and the subsequent analysis of the social attitudes which led to the result absolutely do show that the Scots are dferent to the English, at least so far as attitudes to the EU are concerned.Of course, the inevitable question for future discussion is how best to finesse these dferences.

This, after three years of everyone being told by David Cameron and everyone , including Theresa May, the Prime Minister for all her years in the job that it would be final. Not a single voice in any newspaper or anywhere  in the media, in all that time, has ever suggested that the democratic will of the people was only advisory, to be rejected by the House of Commonsit wished. These papers referred to have no credence, no validity, no force, for they have been over-ridden by the repeated statements of the referendum vote being sacrosanct by the current Prime Minister and her predecessor and accepted as such by everyone. Other papers have doubtless been omitted. That is how desperate the losers are to recover their position.Many have objected that the decision was wrong, but that it was the will of the people has been accepted for three years before the vote was ever held. These letters advancing the case of the referendum are the last-ditch defence of people who think they know better than the will of the people of the country. That arrogance has been demolished many times these last three years.We must leave and we must do so with honour. We must control our manner of leaving and not be bullied by the EU.

For a start, the gorge is ft deep which means the only way to get at the ldquonon-native species ndash Japanese knotweed and rhododendron ponticum ndash is to abseil down. The abseilers then have to identy where the plants are and spray them with weed-killer. Even the trust admits itrsquos pretty extreme stuff, but this is the point wersquore at now. In fact, the people working to eradicate ldquonon-native species see operations such as the one at Corrieshalloch as a ldquowar or ldquobattle against an ldquoinvasion or ldquoswarm. Those are the words they use. The defenders of our apparently native plants talk like theyrsquore on a battlefield or in a B-movie. And no-one laughs.However, I think now is the time to start questioning the orthodoxy,only to save us from more hyperbole. The narrative of the National Trust, and other organisations ndash backed by the Scottish and UK Governments ndash is that ldquonon-native species cost millions of pounds and that they must be eradicated to protect the ldquonative ones, even though their argument defies common sense, the history of the planet and the evolution of plants and animals. A fir tree or a grey squirrel doesnrsquot know where the border between two countries is, and nor should they, because the ision between native and non-native, like borders, is entirely man-made.The rhododendron ponticum that the National Trust wants to eradicate from Corrieshalloch is a good example. The plant has had all kinds of UKIP-style rhetoric thrown at it over the yearsand itrsquos mainly because, according to its detractors, it spreads fast and prevents other plants from growing. James Fenton, an ecologist who has worked for the National Trust, has even suggested thatwe took no action to control the plant and came back in a thousand years, the landscape of Scotland would be just one dark rhododendron forest.But could I stick up for the rhododendron ponticum, based on what the plant actually does  Itrsquos true that it thrives in certain types of soil, but it is no more or less likely to spread than ivy or bracken. The dference, of course, between bracken and rhododendron ponticum is that one is considered native and the other non-native even though rhododendron ponticum was certainly in this part of the world before the last Ice Age and was then reintroduced to Britain from seeds  years ago. How long does a plant have to be here before it is considered native The idea that rhododendron ponticum would spread ad infinitum is also flawed ndash thatrsquos just not how nature works. For example, the Americans used to get hysterical about the purple loosestre plant, which was accused of the same crime as rhododendron ponticum ndash reducing ersity ndash but the long-term evidence was dferent: there was a first wave of the plant, then it declined, and the natural ersity reasserted itself. With the exception of very small islands, this is what new species in an area do: they increase ersity rather than reduce it.The search for a scientic definition of ldquonon-native does not help either because there isnrsquot one. In fact, the whole idea of native and non-native was pretty much invented by Victorian botanists like Hewitt Watson, although no one has ever really been able to agree what the words mean. Should we go back to some kind of year zero ndashbut then how far back would you go  Andyou go too far back, you reach a point where the world was one great continent anyway and every plant and animal could spread and roam freely.Some attempts to define native and non-native are based on whether there has been human intervention, which is the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach, but this is also far from consistent. There is a widely-held view, for example, that grey squirrelsare non-native and should be culled, but why arenrsquot we seeking to eradicate other species that have been introduced such as the common pheasant  And what about the collared dove  Why spend money on measures to control the grey squirreland nothing on the collared dove, which has only been around in the UK since the s but is presumably competing with ldquonative birds for food It is this kind of inconsistency that makes a mockery of the whole native non-native ision and the National Trust for Scotlandrsquos operation at Corrieshalloch Gorge. Letrsquos deal with facts instead. Such as this one: plants and animals are not harmful just because they were introduced by humans, nor are they necessarily good for bioersity because they werenrsquot.And this fact: there are much greater environmental threats than the spread of ldquonon-native species, such as plastic and other types of waste, intensive farming, and industrial pollution - all of which are linked to the most dangerous native of all: humans.And then therersquos this fact: our ecology is changing all the time, animals and plants come and go, they thrive, fade, spread, fall back and rise again, and therersquos no reason why a erse and healthy environment of the future canrsquot include so-called non-native species. In fact, do you think that in a thousand years the petty definitions that are driving us to the bottom of gorges with weedkiller will matter  Our ecology will have moved on. There may not even be a Scotland or any other border by which to define our species. And the best thing about that  The plants and the animals will just get on with it anyway. They wonrsquot even notice."},{"url":null,"title":"year-in-review-looking-back-at-a-bruising-2018","story":"It brought us Cuba without a Castro at the helm and Cambridge Analytica out of the shadows.In France the prevailing political colour was yellow, while across Yemen starvation remained an added predator in a war in which children were increasingly the victims.In all,  globally was a bruising year for the optimists and one that began and ends with a shutdown of the US government as Donald Trump the man who dominated the yearrsquos headlines continues to make them.As one New York Times headline put it earlier this month, for Mr Trump itrsquos ldquo a war every day, waged increasingly alone.That much was evident at yearrsquos end as US Defence Secretary James Mattis, the man many regarded as the ldquolast adult in the room of Mr Trumprsquos White House resigned over the Presidentrsquos abrupt decision to withdraw US troops from Syria and Afghanistan.As the New Year looms the US federal government is expected to remain partially closed in a protracted standoff over Mr Trumprsquos demand for money to build a border wall with Mexico.For many in Washington this parting shot of  and the standoff and political acrimony created is just another ominous portent of things to come in , a year in which the President will come under unprecedented pressure as legal investigations pile up around him.Looking back on  the US mid-term elections might just have marked the beginning of the end of Donald Trumprsquo presidency, but only time will tell.Overall Americans must have done a lot of soul searching last year as their country remained a fractured place and the scourge of another shooting took its toll on civilians in Parkland Florida.Elsewhere in the world it was no less turbulent as Moscow under Russian President Vladimir Putin increasingly made its stamp on the global stage. Who can forget that wink from the Russian leader to his US counterpart at the start of the Helsinki summit  Who was not flabbergasted that Mr Trump then went on to side with Russia against the FBI over claims of interference in the  presidential election Both men are not known for being well disposed towards a free and unfettered media and last year was one in which threats to press freedom reached a new high.The brutal killing of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi was a chilling reminder of what media watchdog Reporters Without Bordersdescribed in wider terms as hatred whipped up by ldquounscrupulous politicians.Mr Khashoggirsquos murder shocked the world and put the country, and its young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman under closer international scrutiny.If there is an upside to this terrible story itrsquos that perhaps at least it helped bring pressure on Riyadh over its prosecution of the Saudi led coalition war in Yemen.This month ldquomilestone peace talks began in Sweden and the hope is they will help bring about an end to a war that has resulted in  million people or half of Yemenrsquos population now needing aid to survive.But Yemen is not the only place in  that saw humanitarian agencies placed under enormous pressure. As I write Indonesia again reels from a deadly tsunami, an eerie reminder of the terrible Boxing Day disaster back in .In Democratic Republic of Congo too an Ebola epidemic that has taken grip is itself a devastating repeat of a similar outbreak in West Africa in .In the Middle East so often a crucible of suffering there was some good news as Iraqi voters flocked to the polls in  for the first time since driving out the Islamic Stategroup in  after the Iraq civil war.It was signicant election for the country as Iraqis were given the power to decide their future with the potential to sht the balance of power and mend isions between ethnic groups.That said, the jihadists of IS continued to pose a considerable threat in  with many analysts suggesting they were reconstituting their forces and establishing a network of cells to pursue a guerrilla insurgency both in Iraq and neighbouring Syria.Elsewhere around the world Islamist-inspired terror cast its shadow. In Europe, France once again bore the brunt, most recently when -year-old Cher Chekatt, armed with a gun and kne near Strasbourgrsquos famed Christmas market killed two and injured another  people.The terror attack came at what was already a turbulent moment for France as one of the yearrsquos most ldquovisible political phenomena, the gilets jaunes or yellow vest movement took to the streets in a challenge to French President Emmanuel Macron.Ugly as the scenes in Paris have been, in terms of international stories this past year, the gilets jaunes protests against what they see as financial exploitation by the Francersquos privileged metropolitan elite, captured the imagination of many around the world.It was a year also in which we witnessed a backlash against big tech. More people in  have access to the internet than safe drinking water.But as the worldrsquos digital population continues to grow there are fears not everyone is reaping the so-called ldquodigital idends of this transformation.The story of how researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan and his company used a personality quiz to harvest the Facebook data of up to  million people before sharing some of it with political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, served as a stark reminder of the dangers that lurk in our digital online age. Perhaps refreshing then to recall that heroic story earlier in  in which a team of young football players and their coach survived for  days before being extracted by cave rescue ers inThailand.Tragic as the death of one courageous rescuer was, how unusual it was to follow a story with a largely happy ending. Rare also to have one that caught the imagination and universal concern of people in a world otherwise riven with ision.Yes, all in all  was a bruising year for the worldrsquos optimists. But letrsquos not give up looking on the bright side.Perhaps, just perhaps,  might finally be the year when that ultimate hogger of headlines, Donald Trump, finally gets his comeuppance as special counsel Robert Muellerrsquos probe finally bears down.A Happy New Year to everyone when it comes."},{"url":null,"title":"national-records-cabinet-worry-over-dunblane-cover-up-theory","story":"Papers released by the National Records of Scotland show the Lab-LibDem Scottish cabinet discussed how to ldquoclose the story down and put an end to conspiracy theories in .It followed the sealing of a  police report into Hamilton for  years, fuelling speculation that it referred to his connections to prominent Scottish figures.Hamilton, who was known to local politicians, murdered  children and a teacher at Dunblane Primary School in  before shooting himself.As part of Lord Cullenrsquos inquiry into the massacre, some of the records relating to Hamilton were closed for  years to protect any child victims and their siblings.This included a  report by detective sergeant Paul Hughes of Central Scotland Police who investigated Hamiltonrsquos alleged physical abuse of children at a summer camp he ran.It recommended Hamilton be prosecuted for his behaviour, but Mr Hughesrsquos police superiors and the local procurator fiscal declined to take any further action.The Hughes report also recommended Hamilton should lose his firearms licence.Amid calls from the SNP and others to publish the full report, then Lord Advocate Colin Boyd QC discussed the  year closure decision at the Scottish cabinet of  February .ldquoIf it was likely to be helpful in ending the speculation, he [Mr Boyd] would consider releasing an adapted report, the minute said.ldquoBut since it did not include the type of references suspected, it might lead to calls for other papers to be released.

Arguably, it was the first such year for a decade, given  was so dominated by the independence fight.It showed. The SNP lacked its usual dynamo.The absence of a campaign put the spotlight on to its record rather than its aspirations, and demonstrated why the First Minister and other politicians love a good contest.Making promises is so much easier than keeping them.After years in door-knocking mode, the SNP ranks got antsy. Where was the referendum they had been promised  Surely Ms Sturgeonrsquos talk of a ldquotriple lock mandate the previous year wasnrsquot just a piece of rhetorical thistledown Troubled by the listlessness at the top, the Yes movement took it on itself to organise.A series of marches organised by the All Under One Banner group brought tens of thousands on to the streets of cities around Scotland through the spring and summer.In the SNP deputy leadership race, Inverclyde councillor Chris McEleny stood on an explicit  of a second referendum in .His rivals felt compelled to talk up the prospect of another vote too, although they were more circumspect about dates.Nor did the partyrsquos long-lost Growth Commission allay activist jitters when it finally appeared.Andrew Wilsonrsquos revised economic blueprint for independence was more curds and vinegar than milk and honey. The left of the party baulked at its hairshirt focus on deficit reduction and its plan to keep sterling.More tensions bubbled to the surface at the SNPrsquos October conference, with MP Angus Macneil telling his party not to ldquodither like the Jacobites at Derby when they gave up their march on London.Other MPs suggested independence might arrive via an unidentied ldquodemocratic event rather than a referendum, given Theresa May refused to grant the latter.It was hardly a schism, but such shows of frustration and doubt with the leadership are rare in the modern SNP.Citing the delays and muddleover Brexit, the First Minister backed away from her pledge to give a ldquoprecise timescale for Indyref in the autumn, kicking her announcement into the New Year - for now - and making a Peoplersquos Vote on Brexit her priority, even though another EU referendum would not leave enough time for a new independence vote before .By December, even Alex Salmond was questioning his successorrsquos appetite for a second referendum, wondering on his RT TV showthe ldquoCaledonian leboat would ever be launched.The former first minister was a key part of the SNPrsquos grim year. In January, two female civil servants made sexual misconduct complaints against him relating to .It would be another seven months, after an investigation overseen by Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans, that their existence would enter the public domain.When they did, the effect was explosive. Furious at the way the case had been handled, Mr Salmond launched a judicial review against the government he once led and quit the SNP after  years as a member,  as its leader, to spare it ldquointernal ision.It took him barely three days to crowdsource pound, to pay for the legal action.Ms Sturgeon publicly backed Ms Evans. Battle lines were drawn. Mr Salmond reportedly refers to his former protegee as Lady Macbeth and is gunning for one of her key aides.When the judicial review hearing starts at the Court of Session two weeks today, Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeonrsquos government will play for keeps. A polarising fight could see SNP members take sides. It is a moment the party should dread.The reorganisation of income tax into five bands, albeit under pressure from the Scottish Greens, was another bold change. Derek Mackayrsquos decision not to copy Tory tax cuts in England and Wales for the wealthy has continued the experiment, despite flak about a cross-border tax gap.But in education, Ms Sturgeonrsquos top priority, and in health, which consumes almost half the Scottish revenue budget, the Governmentrsquos record has been lamentable.There is no expectation that NHS waiting time or treatment targets will be hit any more. When the monthly stats come out, the only question is how badly they will be missed.Demonstrating how much tougher it is to run a delivery department than shuffle money, former finance secretary John Swinney has toiled in the education brief.In June, he was forced to halt his flagship school reform bill because of a lack of support. To give him cover for this woeful climbdown, Ms Sturgeon reshuffled her Cabinet the same day, getting shot of Shona Robison from health and Keith Brown from economy.But the excitement at the promotion of a new generation of ministers didnrsquot last long. In a blog written long before she became an MSP, Gillian Martin had written about ldquohairy knuckled, lipstick-wearing transgender laydees.Despite its existence being reported in , no one in government read it for the reshuffle. Ms Martin became the mayfly minister, in charge of higher education for a day, then gone. Ms Sturgeonrsquos judgment was put under the microscope and found wanting.Mr Swinney was also humiliated by MSPs voting against standardised testing for P pupils, and by some councils refusing to implement it.The first teachersrsquo strike in a generation is looming over pay.But as Ms Sturgeonrsquos deputy, he remains unsackable.At health, Jeane Freeman has come clean about problems she has inherited, writing off pound million of emergency loans to health boards they canrsquot repay and admitting ldquolegally binding waiting time guarantees will be missed until .However Audit Scotland continues to warn of cash problems in health as well as across local government, where reserves are being run down to an alarming degree.Itrsquos been no picnic on the railways either, with ScotRailrsquos performance hitting record lows, and Transport Secretary Michael Matheson impotently huffing and puffing at the franchise holder Abellio.Worse, he waived sanctions for their lousy service after accepting much of the blame lay with Network Rail, which is owned by the UK Government. The SNPrsquos plan to merge British Transport Police and Police Scotland north of the Border was aborted.As with much of Brexit, the fights of a few months ago, so intense at the time, seem dim and distant. In the spring, Ms Sturgeon and Michael Russell led a cross-party Continuity Bill through Holyrood to avoid a lsquopower grabrsquo of devolved competencies.But the Supreme Court effectively gutted it after a challenge by the UK government delayed its Royal Assent and allowed Westminsterrsquos EU Withdrawal Act to supersede it.Mr Russell also threatened to gum up the constitutional works by withholding consent for any Brexit-related Bill that came to Holyrood under the Sewel convention, then quietly backed down in the face of a Bill that was needed to give Scots health cover after Brexit.Despite all that, Ms Sturgeon remains a top-flight politician.In the last year, she has successfully portrayed Scotland as a beacon of stability amid the roiling chaos of Brexit.

Each writer has then paired up with a composer and visual artist or film-maker, with the results of each collaboration projected in monumental fashion on the walls of one of half a dozen of the capitalrsquos most iconic buildings.With venues stretching from the south side of Edinburgh to Leith, and with one city centre stop requiring a walk up Calton Hill, there is considerable legwork required to complete the circuit. It shouldnrsquot be considered a race, however, and audiences are free to move between venues at their leisure, visiting each site on dferent evenings between dusk and pm to suit their schedules as desired.Unlike last yearrsquos inaugural event, when novelist Val McDermid charted the le and work of neglected nineteenth century novelist Susan Ferrier through ious Edinburgh streets, there is no continuous narrative in this yearrsquos Message from the Skies. This makes each work akin to a set of site-specic installations and environmental interventions that transform their immediate landscape.Such reimagining of the city capitalises on the recent epic-scale opening events commissioned by Edinburgh International Festival, and featuring overwhelming sound and light shows created by  Productions and projected onto the Usher Hall and Edinburgh Castle. Unlike those spectacles, words are the primary focus of this yearrsquos Message from the Skies, which looks set to be a more reflectivenot always meditative affair.ldquoItrsquos very dferent this year, explains Glass. ldquoWersquove got six very dferent writers, and each one has taken a completely dferent approach to the brief they were given, which was simply to write a love letter to Europe. I suppose thatrsquos made for more free-expression than last year, which seems only fitting just now given everything thatrsquos going on, and itrsquos been really gratying as dferent drafts have come in, and incredibly emotional as well. It really feels like this is what art should be doing right now.The writers include historian William Dalrymple, who takes an impassioned look at Scotlandrsquos relationship with mainland Europe against the backdrop of the Tron Kirk, brought to le by bespoke projection company Double Take Productions, and featuring a score from composer RJ McConnell.Bulgarian born and Highland-based non-fiction writer Kapka Kassabova will explore the origins of Europe alongside the even more dramatic Scottish Monument on Calton Hill. This will be accompanied by a score by Pippa Murphy, which is inspired by Greek, Mesopotamian and Gaelic female chanting, while images from Susannah Murphy and Cristina Spiteri of Bright Side Studios dissolve into the ether as time moves on.Leith Library is the setting for poet William Letfordrsquos touching reminiscences, with artist James Houston taking a typographical approach to illustrating the story. At Custom House, also in Leith, journalist Chitra Ramaswamyrsquos letter looks back to her childhood, holidays in Spain and le in Scotland with roots as a second-generation immigrant. Daniel Warrenrsquos accompanying film will mix archive footage and animation, and will feature a song by Emma Pollock.Up at the Cowgate, at the Bongo Club, playwright Stef Smith joins forces with composer MJ McCarthy and artist Eleanor Meredith for a moving tale of separation and broken hearts set to McCarthyrsquos ambient score and Meredithrsquos vivid watercolours. Over at the Tech Cube in Summerhall, fiction writer Louise Welsh pares things back to explore the international language of words themselves, with designer Emlyn Firth using typography to illustrate it.With a total of sixteen artists working on Message from the Skies, this multi-media fusion of form and content is itself an illustration of what might happenshared experience is used for the power of good.ldquoThe collaborations were the fun bit of it, says Glass. ldquoI spoke to each of the writers very early on, and started to try and get a feel for how they were thinking, and how they formally might approach things. Listening to that, you start to see and hear things that makes you think about what the end result might be, and to keep the authenticity of that you start to think about people from other artistic disciplines who might sit well within what each writer is doing, and you try and pair them up. People just wouldnrsquot have come into each otherrsquos spheres without this project, and you start to see and hear the words dferently.Glass doesnrsquot mention Brexit by name, but the shadow of the UKrsquos forthcoming departure from Europe looms large over Message from the Skies. Run in partnership between current Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay producers Underbelly, Edinburgh City of Literature and Edinburgh International Book Festival, and enabled by the Scottish Governmentrsquos Festivals Expo fund, the initiative also points up some of the problems which have already arisen regarding bringing artists from abroad to these shores.While the writers werenrsquot asked which way they voted regarding Brexit before they were commissioned, that should become clear from the work itself. There is little in the way of tub-thumping on display, however, with each piece humanised by the deeply personal tone of them all.ldquoDidactic is word thatrsquos been used a lot when wersquove talked about some of the big polarisations that exist when wersquore talking about Europe just now, says Glass. ldquoA lot of those conversations have been about the role of writers and artists in managing those conversations, and whatrsquos happened as wersquove gone along is that itrsquos become okay to make statements that are hard. There may be people who disagree with whatrsquos in a letter, but I think itrsquos still important to be able to make the space to have that conversation.The words written by the six writers taking part in Message from the Skies will live on regardless of what happens next, and can be published in book formdesired. The assorted artworks that bring those words to le have also been created with the same sense of love and care, and given the scale of the event, it is hoped that they too might have another le, crossing borders with their own unique sonic and visual languages as they go.ldquoWouldnrsquot it be brilliantthis could go across the world and other people could see it  Glass muses. ldquoWouldnrsquot it be wonderfulit could travel Message from the Skies, ious venues, Edinburgh, today-January , dusk-pm.www.edinburghshogmanay"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburghs-hogmanay-review-concert-in-the-gardens","story":"Concert in the GardensEdinburghrsquos HogmanayNeil Cooper****The spirit of Glasgow club-night Optimo hung over the capital on a grand scale to see out  with a very hip spring in its step.While Optimo DJs prepared to man the decks alongside Chicago House queen The Black Madonna at Leith Theatre, Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay kick-started official celebrations with a mainstage triple bill headlined by Franz Ferdinand, one of the first of a post-millennium art-pop new wave to infiltrate the mainstream.That happened shortly after the bandrsquos first scheduled Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay appearance was cancelled due to high winds.Fteen years on, the same slot is taken by Free Love, the Glasgow-based duo of Suzi Rodden and Lewis Cook formerly known as Happy Meals.The euphoric storm of hippied techno whipped up by a barefoot Rodden and a beret-clad Cook on an analogue electronic kit flanked by a mini backdrop of psychic signs and symbols suggests biblical weather wouldnrsquot be a problem.Rodden revels in conjuring electronic zaps into the air inbetween singing in French or  breaking out into Lindsay Kemp style dance routines.

who lives in Thurso, has been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Year honours list in recognition of his services to the community in Caithness. He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.ldquoWe had been in No.  Group Bomber Command, says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. ldquoThe whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. ldquoWe had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogetherhellip It required a lot of dferent techniques.ldquoAnd it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore yoursquod got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.ldquoThere developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.ldquoOn one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnrsquot just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.ldquoObviously we knew something was happening, Don says, ldquobecause we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werenrsquot aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. ldquoBefore that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: ldquoOne thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Donrsquos chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as ldquoPiccadilly Circus ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.ldquoWe were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place, he explains. ldquoIt was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. ldquoThey all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. ldquoHe released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one, says Don.ldquoThere was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnrsquot a great deal of resistance.It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crewmates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: ldquoThe Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.ldquoYou couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnrsquot want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  ldquoWell, everybodyrsquos scared ndash I donrsquot care what anyone says, he replies. ldquoIf yoursquore not scared you donrsquot perform, but itrsquos discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .ldquoThis is rude, I know, but itrsquos what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Itrsquos a matter of accepting whatrsquos going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job yoursquore supposed to do.ldquoItrsquos not a question of bravery. Irsquom very suspicious when people say, lsquoOh, yoursquore a brave man,rsquo or lsquoYouve got a lot of courage.rsquo You react to circumstances. Itrsquos a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.ldquoAnd I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when yoursquove got a unorm on and yoursquore acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.ldquoSo Irsquom very suspicious about lsquobraveryrsquo. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I donrsquot think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I donrsquot know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.DON can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.ldquoI fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhamrsquos Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating, Don says. ldquoHe had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a manrsquos wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.ldquoBut the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thatrsquos what I did.He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash ldquoI went to Arnhem five times during that debacle, says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until rsquo.He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crewmates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.ldquoAlthough our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand, says Don. ldquoIn  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnrsquot got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hersquod said, lsquoIrsquod love to see my old mate again.rsquo So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.ldquoNow you canrsquot explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Itrsquos what they call camaraderie. Irsquom still in touch with his family.As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash ldquotherersquos no doubt about that. But he adds: ldquoI regret to say I donrsquot think wersquove learned any lessons. I donrsquot think we should be doing what wersquore doing now [in Iraq].ldquoAs I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Itrsquos not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Itrsquos a sad reflection on society, I feel.ldquoWe ought to be very thankful that wersquore free, because thatrsquos what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnrsquot be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.ldquoIt was all for a cause.

Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue. The move from loan schemes to direct payments and other schemes meeting set payment deadlines will build trust within the sector in the post-Brexit era and aid the organisation and planning of farm businesses in uncertain times.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

With , people expected to visit it within its first year of opening, it’s a powerful symbol of Dundee’s new confidence and a major addition to our world-class collection of museums and visitor attractions.: Nicola Sturgeon: I’ll protect Scotland’s place in EuropeAnd I was delighted to see the Highlands and Islands as the only UK destination listed in the Lonely Planet’s Best in Travel  top  regions, which is a really positive accolade for the year ahead.I am excited that Scotland will once again play host to the very best international sporting talent at a number of major events this year. In March, more than  athletes from  nations will take to the tracks at the Emirates Arena for the  European Indoor Athletics.While at Gleneagles in September, we will host the Solheim Cup, the biggest and best team event in women’s golf and a highlight of the sporting calendar. I’m sure that the world-class competition on show as Europe’s finest take on their American counterparts will make for an incredible spectacle, inspiring our young people, particularly girls, and once again showcasing Scotland as the perfect stage for major events.The Solheim Cup ends a full summer of golf, including the Aberdeen Standard Investments Scottish Open and Ladies Scottish Open, and will be a key part of an incredible summer for Scottish women’s sport, with our national football team competing in the World Cup in France and our hosting of the  UEFA Women’s Under- Championship.Scotland’s growing screen sector is also opening up opportunities for tourism and exposing Scotland’s natural beauty and heritage to new audiences. We have already seen the benefits of the Outlander effect – with visitor numbers to locations featured in the series increasing signicantly. And we would expect this trend to continue with Netflix’s recently released Outlaw King, filmed across  dferent Scottish locations including Craigmillar Castle, Linlithgow Palace and Talisker on Skye, and the new Mary Queen of Scots film set to be released later this month, which was filmed in Glencoe and in Edinburgh.: Outlander effect pushes tourist numbers in Scotland to record highWhile increasing visitor numbers is of course welcome, it is important that we have the infrastructure in place to handle the demand of increasing visitors. Our £ million Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund has been designed to manage growth sustainably, so the services and facilities that visitors and local communities need are provided. I was delighted to announce the first round of funding for the scheme to help support the creation of additional parking at Glenfinnan, and make improvements to facilities at other iconic sights like the Old Man of Storr and Cairngorms National Park. Some local authorities have called on the Scottish Government to give them the powers to introduce a tourism tax to help them meet the pressures of increasing visitors to their area. The Scottish Government has no plans to introduce a tourism tax but we do recognise there is a need to properly consider the wide range of views on this issue. We are currently convening a national discussion to give everyone an opportunity to air their views and have invited contributions and participation from a wide range of groups with an interest in tourism, economic growth and public sector finance, to ensure an informed, evidence-led discussion on this complex issue.Scotland continues to be an outward-looking and inclusive nation. And a nation that people at home and abroad should want to visit. This is an important message, particularly at this time with the UK’s exit from the EU fast approaching. Clearly Brexit will have profound implications for Scotland as a whole, but I know there are deep concerns in the tourism industry.Europe currently accounts for seven out of Scotland’s ten key visitor markets – and around  per cent of our overseas visitors. And the industry’s workforce is reliant on EU citizens – with around  per cent of those working in the sector from the EU.I am acutely aware of industry concerns around recruitment and retention of EU staff, which will not have been eased by the restrictive policy approach put forward by the UK Government in their Immigration White Paper. The evidence is very clear that our tourism sector would be poorer without the vital skills and experience of EU citizens.In the meantime, we are continuing to strengthen our ties with our nations in Europe and around the world, by expanding our network of innovation and investment hubs. And last year we launched the Scotland is Now campaign, promoting Scotland under a single, unied, national brand and bringing together combined spending of up to £ million to promote our country globally. In these uncertain times and in the face of a number of challenges, it is fantastic to see the on-going success of tourism and the Scottish Government, working with our national tourism organisation VisitScotland, will do all it can to help the industry continue to grow sustainably.With unrivalled sights, memorable visitor experiences and incredible hidden history let us all make that resolution to experience more of the place we are proud to call home.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4850523.1546279029!/image/image.jpg","title":"new year s resolutions for sturgeon may and co paris gourtsoyannis","story":"From settling Brexit to challenging Donald Trump, the coming year will be a pivotal one for politicians, writes Paris Gourtsoyannis.In the first three months alone, this year carries huge signicance for the future of the UK – but beyond Westminster, political leaders across the Western world could also do with a bit of introspection by way of first-foot.Here are a few New Year’s resolutions that those facing big decisions in  might want to consider.Nicola Sturgeon: Deliver home truths about indyrefOn independence, her critics would say Nicola Sturgeon has been the First Minister who cried wolf. She called for a second referendum on Scotland’s future, then backed down in the face of popular uncertainty. But to use a dferent cliché, indyref was the dog that didn’t bark in .Sturgeon can’t be blamed for the UK Government’s failure to settle the outcome of Brexit in time for the SNP leader to offer clarity on a second Scottish independence referendum – but that won’t hold for long in . She will eventually have to show her hand.When that moment comes, it will offer her the opportunity to deliver some home truths to her own supporters: that there isn’t time or means to keep Scotland in the EUthe UK leaves, and that true shape of the relationship between Brussels and London may not be known until close to the next Scottish election in .The Government in Edinburgh insists it has a mandate for a new independence referendum from this Scottish Parliament. Butthe Sturgeon believes the public will back leaving the UK over the final Brexit deal, why wouldn’t she put that to the public in  and prove it Another hold-up might not be the message independence activists want to hear, but it may be the only way to convince the majority of Scots that the question needs to be asked again.The UK Government: Get back to delivering the milkIt’s been a busy two-and-a-half years for the Blitz spirit, invoked at every opportunity by Brexit campaigners. It should mean automatic disqualication from public debate to suggest that the privations of wartime Britain are something to aspire to for the future, rather than a lesson from the past.Nonetheless, helped along by a handful of recent blockbuster Hollywood depictions, Winston Churchill has been repeatedly dragged into debate on Brexit by both sides either in support of the myth that Britain has always ‘stood alone’ in Europe, or that European unity was a Churchillian idea. In our present situation, I personally find the most useful quote attributed to Churchill his reflection that: “Democracy means when there’s a knock at the door at am, it’s probably the milkman.”The comment is obviously referring to examples of brutal oppression by the undemocratic governments of his time, but it also reflects the truth that democracy, when it s, is in part the triumph of small freedoms and practicalities over the big, dangerous idea.Events have moved at such a pace that it’s been impossible to stop and ask where we are. But however you feel about Brexit, it’s clear that a government of a wealthy country forced to nationalise shipping capacity to guarantee supplies of food and medicine, not because of a natural disaster but a political event taking place in just three months’ time, isn’t a responsible government, but one that has already failed.It serves the interests of a narrow and extreme segment of opinion to raise the stakes and turn every issue facing the West into a test of national virility. It allows representative democracies to be hijacked by debates about honouring ‘national sovereignty’ and ‘the will of the people’, asthose weren’t deeply conflicted and debatable concepts.Churchill should be invoked not just to remind us of our finest hour, but of just how banal democracy is supposed to be, when it works well.EU leaders: Tackle anti-immigration agenda head-onEurope has challenges beyond Brexit to face in , and the continent will have to find its way without the certainty of Angela Merkel’s leadership.She offered the strongest, most consistent defence of European values in response to the wave of refugees from conflicts across the Middle East and Africa. Someone  will need to step into her shoes and ensure the anti-immigration narrative doesn’t metastasise into a yellow-vested popular movement that could disrupt upcoming national and EU Parliament elections.US Democrats: Remember who your enemy isIt seems crazy that, with the US Presidential election still almost two years away,  will be decisive in whittling down the field of candidates seeking to oust Donald Trump from the White House.The Democrats would do well to ensure that the process doesn’t turn into a bloodletting. The signs aren’t good, with backers of  left-wing challenger Bernie Sanders and  breakthrough candidate Beto O’Rourke tearing chunks out of each other on social media.Yes, the party needs to refresh its identity to try win back the voters that helped deliver Trump the presidency.But Democrats also need their whole coalition to back the candidate they eventually settle on – something they didn’t achieve in .So much of the political narrative across the West relies on the outcome of the  presidential election. Perhaps more than in any US vote in history, the eyes of the world will be on the Democratic Party. They need to get it right.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England.

He worked as a barge loader on the Strabane-Derry Canal and he was known as a quiet man with an abiding interest in the history and folklore of his area.Jimmy Joe Reynolds was from Leitrim. He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford. After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time.

We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line. It cannot and will not be abandoned or renegotiated,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27508  ","story":" Síle DarraghWhen young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this state, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland. was a milestone in a changing Ireland. It was given voice in the Repeal referendum. In Belfast the largest political demonstration was Pride. For this generation the border is an anachronism. When the Repeal result was read out a sign was held aloft, ‘The North is next’. Rights transcend borders and so does this generation. will mark the centenary of the First Dáil. A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8745500.1545401332!/image/image.jpg","title":"galgorm resort and spa evacuated","story":"Galgorm Resort and Spa has ed to business as usual after an evacuation earlier this afternoon.The hotel was evactuated as a precaution following a small electrical fire, which had been dealt with by staff by the time the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service had arrived at the scene, a fire service spokesperson said.Galgorm Resort and Spa.Victoria Brown, marketing manager at Galgorm Resort and Spa, said: “As a precautionary measure we evactuated the resort this afternoon following an incident whereby smoke was seen coming from a ceiling .

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour.

Take some time to yourself, some time to reflect, some time to remember and some time to recharge the batteries for the New Year ahead.“Andpossible take some time for others, I have really enjoyed meeting people during my term of office and sometimes a kind word or deed, or just a chat can lt someone’s day. So this Christmas time, maybe call on people who may be lonely or those in need of comfort.“I also know that for many families, like myself and my husband, Christmas can be a dficult time. “It stirs up lots of memories of good times and bad, of love, and of loss. For those people and families, I have no words of good advice, as I’m still just getting through, but I will say, be kind to yourself, be kind to others, and do what is right for you. “I wish you all a very Happy Christmas and a Peaceful and Prosperous New Year!”* Bins scheduled to be collected on on Boxing Day, Wednesday, December , will be collected on Saturday, December .

offer in case of emergency card","story":"Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Policing and Community Safety Partnership , in partnership with local police is launching a new community safety initiative, in case of emergency card , to make sure people get the best treatment at a time when they need it most.Indicating who should be contacted in the event of an accident or emergency, the ICE Card also provides your medical information including any conditions or allergies you may have, medication you are taking and your blood type.An emergency can strike anywhere - you might be far from home, family or friends - and carrying the ICE Card means that your loved ones can be reached quickly and avoids the problem of unlocking mobile for emergency details.Stressing the importance of carrying an ICE Card, Chair of ABC PCSP, Councillor Joe Nelson commented: “This is a very simple yet effective initiative. Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern

In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"meet the brexitbashing twitter account followed by leo varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Only tickets for practice days remain.On a winter planning visit to the course, Mike Woodcock, director of corporate communications at the RA, said the pace at which tickets went took them by surprise.“We were confident there would be huge excitement here but I think even we were staggered by just how much there was when the championship days sold out in two months,” he said.“It was phenomenal really and I think that speaks volumes about the enthusiasm, not only for golf but for sport here in Northern Ireland.“The Open is one of the world’s greatest sporting events, the world’s greatest golfers will be playing here, and I think it’s just fantastic. We’re seeing a real buzz.”Due to the anticipated large crowds, this year’s Open was the first ever all-ticketed event in the Major tournament’s history – , people are expected through the gates.After meeting club officials, tourism bosses, emergency services and other state agencies involved in putting on the tournament, Mr Woodcock said plans were well ahead of schedule.The RA has already predicted that the tournament will deliver an £ million boost to the local economy, through combined direct spend and the value of the media exposure of the destination., Head of Corporate

Portrush, on the th green of the course at Royal Portrush Golf Club “Most of all I think it will be the number of golf fans who will come here from around the world, who have seen images of the Open on television and want to come and play here where they have seen Roryplaying, where they have seen Tigerplaying, and I think that’s what the real benefit is and I think years on from now that will continue,” said Mr Woodcock.Aine Kearney, from Tourism NI, is co-ordinating efforts to deliver Northern Ireland’s first Open in seven decades.“This will be broadcast to  million homes across  countries around the world,” she said.“And whilst the focus of the attention will be on the golf, what they will also get to see is the absolutely amazing landscape as well as a lot of the stories of the experiences that the players are having, the media are having – you can’t buy that level of exposure.“That’s why hosting global major events has been such a critical part to our long-term growth strategy and we believe it’s firmly one of the reasons why we are within touching point of becoming a £ billion industry.“It’s all about getting those positive messages out – to change the narrative about Northern Ireland and show the people of the world what an exciting, vibrant and beautul place this is to come and visit.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Open is ing to Northern Ireland for the first time in almost  years Ms Kearney insisted the political impasse at Stormont, which has seen Northern Ireland without devolved government for two years, has not disrupted the plans.“What I have seen is once again a fantastic NI PLC getting together and, regardless of what challenges they have, they are single-minded in delivering the safest and best Open and any hurdles that have been presented to date have been quickly overcome,” she said.Tourism NI hopes the Open will help drive Northern Ireland’s golf tourism spend from £ million per year to £ million by , contributing to the overall goal of making the region’s tourist offering a £ billion annual industry.Royal Portrush member John Bamber, who is chairman of the club’s Open Championship committee, said the dream of once again hosting the tournament was approaching reality.“We have been working on the project probably for the best part of  years and sometimes you do have to pinch yourself to think ‘My goodness, it really is going to happen now in the next seven months’,” he said.“It’s been  years and many people thought the Open Championship was very much in the past tense, that it would neverto the shores of Ireland and Northern Ireland here.” Wire\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Royal Portrush Golf Club last hosted the Open Championship in  WireMr Bamber said when the tickets went on sale in July, he and friends had discussed how fast they would go.“We said ‘I wonder what percentage will be sold by Christmas, by Easter, will it sell out ’,” he said.“We all agreed it would sell out, but nobody genuinely really thought that by the start of the autumn there would be no tickets left.“I was totally shocked but, on reflection, I now understand the excitement amongst the community here, the international community, the business community – everybody wants a piece of this and I really am proud to be involved and we have had a terric team here.”He praised his fellow members for agreeing to a redesign of the course that was pivotal to the RA agreeing to an Open .“I believe our wider membership who have embraced his have an enormous sense of pride and satisfaction about seeing their club – remember we are but temporary custodians – but to see their club elevated again to the premier stage,” he said.Mr Bamber added: “It really makes us feel that we have contributed something, that the club itself has given something back to not only the local community but to the country as a whole and there are very few assets around that have that privilege to be able to do that.“It’s something I believe that’s very, very special and perhaps it might only sink in fully after the event has been here in July

Our proposed solutions have been on the table for months.”Mr Juncker said it was up to the British to decidethe final decision is put back to the people in a second referendum or so-called People’s Vote.However he said he was “working on the assumption thatwill leave, because that is what the people of the United Kingdom have decided”.“I have the impression that the majority of British MPs deeply distrust both the EU and Mrs May,” Mr Juncker added.“It is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means.

And I think that would put us into unprecedented territory with unknowable consequences.”Campaigners for a second EU referendum seized on the International Trade Secretary’s comments, saying that polls suggested that fewer than % of Britons now want to leave the EU.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, a leading supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a referendum, said: “Brexit not happening isn’t - as Liam Fox says. It’s actually -.”The Government is obviously trying to shake us up so we think we have got no choiceDavid DavisFacebookTwitterFormer Brexit Secretary David Davis said he expected defeat for Mrs May’s plan in the Commons to force the UK and EU back to the negotiating table to strike a new deal before March .Mr Davis told LBC radio: “They will have to come back and deal again. The deal she’s got is no good.“It will be very, very nerve-wracking for some people and some companies, but at the end of the day we will get a deal and it will be a better one than she has got. That’s where I think it will go and that’s what I think she should do.”Mr Davis dismissed ministers’ warnings of the dangers of a no-deal Brexit as “scare stories”.“The Government is obviously trying to shake us up so we think we have got no choice,” he said.“They are saying to the ones who want Brexit ‘If you don’t vote for this you won’t get Brexit’ and to those who don’t want Brexit ‘If you don’t vote for this you will have the worst sort of Brexit, you will have a hard crash-out’. Both these stories can’t be right.“They are trying to run the clock down.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\". State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mr Ryan also said people across Britain wrote to their MPs demanding greater action against terrorists.The two plain-clothed British soldiers inadvertently drove into the path of the funeral before mourners pulled them from the car and were beaten before being shot dead by members of the IRA.The murders happened days after the funerals of the three IRA members who were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain Mr Ryan said after meeting backbenchers at Westminster, he was struck by their exasperation and anger \"without any proper sense of how to ventilate it\" while there was a resurgence of \"frustrated patience\" with Ireland.\"The complexity of the issues elude their instinctual approach to policy questions, that of self-interested pragmatism and this further fuels their primary response to events such as last Saturdays,\" he added. State papers: Thatcher warned Haughey of worst civil war everUK allowed Irish unity \"It has to be said that no amount of violence toward the UDR, the RUC and Northern Irish or Irish civilians of any religious persuasion could come anywhere near provoking the same reaction in Britain to Saturdays killings - and the sort of killings they were - of their own English soldiers.\"He later said there was a risk the Anglo-Irish relationship and the Agreement may be \"caught in the net\" when MPs look for the reasons behind the murders.Days after the killings, the Secretary of State Tom King, made a speech to the House of Commons in which he described the \"horric events\" that shocked the world. State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"the 13 best memes","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

an early Christmas present for the nurses who helped to save their lives.Saorlaith and Saoirse McLaughlin spent the first few weeks of their lives at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit .The girls were born six weeks prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication called \"Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome,\" where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.Their parents, Bob and Michelle, have since raised a staggering £, for the unit, with the help of their friends and work colleagues.This year alone, they raised over £, through a tattoo fun day and a sponsored walk.But the McLaughlin’s decided that as well as vital equipment for the ward they wanted some of the money to be spent on the nurses, who work so tirelessly for the tiny babies in their care.“This year we wanted to put a bit of focus on the nurses and let them know we appreciate everything they do for sick new borns in Derry and beyond and especially our own twin girls,” explained Bob.“We asked the nurses to give us a list of stuff they needed for their tea room and of course we added a few extras and we are also going to buy them a new three seater sofa.“We felt it was very important that the nurses should have everything they need to make decent food.“It’s not a lot but it will make a dference to them.”“We want them to know that people are thinking of them and appreciate what they do.“The NHS canteen is closed when they are on night sht and at the minute I think all they have is a kettle and a toaster.googletag.cmd.push

voucher.And next month, they will present a cheque for the remaining £, to be spent on frontline services at the unit.“It was fantastic to catch up with some of the lovely nurses who did so much for our girls Cathy McClafferty Bridgeen Devine and Ciara Doherty and they passed on their thanks for the generosity of the public“We’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who made this possible including Michael Kelly who held a fundraiser at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park in the twins’ honour.”The tattoo fun day and last weekend’s sponsored walk have raised over £,, which will be donated to the unit next month.Mr McLaughlin says his employers and colleagues at First Source have played a huge part in helping them raise the £, over the past three years.“The management have been so supportive,” he continued.“They pick their own charity every year, but they also help a lot of smaller charities and a lot of it goes under the radar because they don’t advertise it.“When I brought my sponsorship form for the walk into work I raised £, in just five hours.“That’s how generous people in First Source are, there were people donating £ and £.”Picture Saorlaith and Saoirse

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said. I am delighted that this funding gives us the potential for its restoration and that future generations will also be able to enjoy the facility and engage with its heritage, he added.The local authority is keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the Walled Garden area designed to provide access via lt to its upper floor, with the local council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.Politicians were told last week that architects have been awarded the tender for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard and Rhododendron Wood areas, with work underway on planning and statutory approvals for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard.It has also been confirmed that a topographical survey mdash which could cost as much as pound, mdashwill be required to assist with the planning process.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.It is envisaged that initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the critically acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood.A critical look has also been taken of the parkrsquos traffic management and parking facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£700k environment scheme set to begin  ","story":"WORK on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick starts on January .The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the initiative which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the scheme to facilitate the contractor.The government department is making a pound, contribution to the public realm project, with the local authority providing the remainder of the cash for the eagerly-awaited revamp.Design proposals have revealed the work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year.The government department said funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.Local council officials are delighted to be working in partnership with the Department for Communities to deliver the project and are looking forward to the benefits that it will bring to Irish Street in terms of regenerating a central part of the town which has missed out on major public sector investment for several decades.Damian Mulholland mdash director of regional development with the Department for Communities mdash said recently that funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.He said the latest investment for Irish Street will enhance the natural heritage of the area at this historic part of the town and help improve visitors and resident experience.Councillor Dermot Curran says he is pleased work will start early in the New Year and has appealed to motorists to be patient during the lane closure.ldquoI realise this will inevitably have an impact on traffic, but hope roads officials will alter the sequencing of town centre traffic lights in a bid to minimise this, he continued. ldquoI hope the lane closure will be in place for the shortest time possible and will be liaising with contractors throughout the duration of the scheme.Cllr Curran said the scheme will help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents and help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment.He continued: ldquoBusiness owners in particular will be delighted that work is due to start soon. As I have said previously, Irish Street is ripe for redevelopment opportunities and this major investment is long overdue.Cllr Curran is also hopeful that Newry, Mourne and Down Council will make a fresh bid for Heritage Lottery Funding to help restore historic buildings within Downpatrickrsquos conservation area, which includes Irish Street.Several weeks ago it was confirmed that the local authorityrsquos initial bid for a so-called townscape initiative had been rejected, despite a signicant amount of time, effort and money being invested in the application process.Officials in charge of the heritage fund claimed the local authorityrsquos bid was influenced by planned regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area ldquorather than heritage need.In addition, they argued there was limited scope within Downpatrickrsquos townscape initiative area to deliver a ldquocomprehensive scheme and believed that given development proposals for Irish Street and the townrsquos former police base, the local authorityrsquos proposed scheme was ldquoinfluenced by regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area.Cllr Curran says he hopes a fresh application will meet with success to assist further the social and economic regeneration of not only Irish Street, but the wider town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch fete Schmidt  ","story":"IRELAND coach Joe Schmidt was the guest of honour at Ballymacarn Park on Friday when  members and guests enjoyed an excellent lunch followed by a question and answer session, conducted by club chairman Philip Gregg.He was his usual humble self as he described his coaching philosophy and the journey he has been on over the past  years and it was a wonderful afternoon for all in attendance.Despite his tight time schedule, Joe took the time to mingle with those present and was a complete gentleman throughout.

Council enforcement officers will also investigate each incident and assessthe culprits can be identied and prosecuted.On Monday night, councillors were told that over the past eight months there have been almost  reported fly tipping incidents across the district.Council staff responded to  incidents, with contractors removing waste on  occasions. Environment Agency staff removed waste on  occasions.While the cost of removing waste over the past eight months is estimated at almost pound,, council officials have suggested the yearly total could top the pound, mark.The cost of flytipping on hard pressed ratepayers comes just a few weeks after council officials were asked to look at innovative ways of combating the problem.Councillors are concerned about the scale of the issue and the restrictions being placed on what material ratepayers can dump at household recycling centres.Some elected representatives have suggested council officials should reintroduce a service used by the former Down Council which arranged for a local authority bin lorry to visit some towns and villages on a Saturday morning to allow people to get rid of their household waste.The scheme proved extremely popular and while it was in service there were few reported flytipping incidents in the area.In addition, community groups helped keep their respective towns and villages clean by taking part in litter picks, with their efforts recognised by the local authority via an awards scheme.Councillors also believe the fact that some of the districtrsquos household recycling centres do not accept certain types of waste is contributing to the scale of the flytipping issue which, they say, must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 19%2C 1978  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash Fears that Newcastlersquos status as a leboat base could be thrown on the rocks were sunk yesterday by the Royal National Leboat Institutionrsquos chief spokesman in Ireland, Lt-Col Brian Clark.In a clear-cut statement he dashed the hopes of  Kilkeel fishermen who have called for a full-scale rescue centre to be set up in their port instead of Newcastle.Lt-Col Clark, who is the RNLIrsquos organising secretary for all of Ireland, has also hit out strongly at claims that the prospect of a tug-orsquo-war situation is looming between Newcastle and Kilkeel.He said: ldquoKilkeel has indeed been considered carefully as a possible location for a leboat, but the major requirement is that a boat must be able to get away from its base promptly in all kinds of weather.ldquoThe RNLI management committee feels that this capability is at present lacking in the case of Kilkeel where strong winds create unfavourable conditions at the entrance to the new harbour. These conditions could prevent a leboat from ing to its moorings and may prevent it from getting out of the harbour on service.Lord Roden, the honorary secretary of the Newcastle leboat station, has also rejected the latest call to switch the leboat base from his town to Kilkeel.ldquoI can give an assurance that Newcastle is taking no part in such an argument, he said. ldquoThe stationing of boats on the coast is solely a matter for the RNLI management committee.ldquoThe Newcastle leboatmen are proud of their boat.

Teddy wouldnrsquot worry sheep. He was far more interested in carrying my sonrsquos bag home from school and things like that.

He said: “Having just twice turned down president Clinton’s offer of a seat on the Supreme Court, Senator Mitchell’s thoughts were understandably not focused principally on Northern Ireland.“The Secretary of State set out the current situation in standard terms and, in answer to a question from Senator Mitchell about what might form the ultimate resolution, explained the talks process and the Government’s interest in securing any solution which commanded the support of the parties.“Nothing was ruled out and nothing ruled in, but it was very unlikely that a majority in Northern Ireland would agree to a united Ireland, so the talks were focusing on the devolution of responsibilities within Northern ireland, the recognition of the Irish identity by means of north south institutions, and keeping open the route to a united Ireland were that ever to become the wish of a majority.”The files declassed at the Public Record Office under the -year rule also show that former US president Jimmy Carter was suggested for the role which would ultimately be taken by Mr Mitchell, that of US peace envoy to Northern Ireland. Jonathan Powell, who would himself have a key role under Tony Blair, was then working in the British Embassy in Washington. He relayed to London that former congressman Bruce Morrison “did not envisage an Irish American filling the role ... he envisaged instead someone completely independent, like Jimmy Carter”.Jacob Rees-Mogg’s ‘odd alliance’ with DUP criticised by NI Tories Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch            ..

A special viewing hide has been built to give people the best chance of seeing them.“Now with those numbers back and restored our visitors are seeing them regularly,” said Mr Edwards.“A lot of people have never seen a red squirrel before, it’s almost this kind of mythical animal to them - something in the Beatrix Potter and Enid Blyton books.“They are so used to seeing the urban grey squirrel everywhere so that’s been fantastic to be able to have those experiences.”The buffer zone stretches across the top of the peninsula from Newtownards to Millisle.Monitoring technology - ranging from motion cameras to fur-capturing sticky pads on feed stations - is placed throughout the zone, to ensure any potentialof the grey is quickly identied.Mr Edwards said vigilance is key, highlighting the risk posed by a disease-carrying grey.“All it could take is just one grey incursion and that grey carrying the squirrel pox virus and it could decimate the population we have left,” he said.The ranger said while some people are uneasy about the killing of greys, he insisted there is a general acceptance that clearances are necessarythe reds are to be saved.“The most negative comment I’ve had in the last four or five years is, ‘I don’t like it, but I understand why’,” he added.“The overwhelming visitor feedback and experience at Mount Stewart has been fantastic and has been really rewarding for us as a team, and the volunteers putting in hours and hours of effort to protect the red squirrel population here and rebuild it.”try catch            ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This will enable those who canrsquot make the Valersquos Daytime meeting to be informed and wersquoll offer help and explanationsneeded.ldquoItrsquos vitally important everyone makes their comments loud and clear in writing to the Vale Council at this time.ldquoWe need to drive home that a by-pass option is accepted through to the next stage of the process. It will be no use people moaning later.ldquoOf course multi-modal proposals can have their place but it is unrealistic to suggest they would ever solve the traffic congestion problem through Dinas Powys without a by-pass and without better park and ride facilities.ldquoBuses are currently used by just two per cent of commuters.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.
