I’m not comfortable with my breasts out just shooting the s**t with you,\u0027\u0027\u0027 she says.  \u0027He smears the gel on with his hands and NO GLOVES on and when he glides the ultrasound wand thing over my breasts he drags his fingers on them and it f**ing bothers me.\u0027Again, AS I TOLD HIM LAST YEAR, I said \u0027\u0027Hey! Do you need to be touching me with your fingers\u0027\u0027 He said \u0027\u0027No\u0027\u0027. And he pulled them off of me.

Wear f***ing GLOVES - this isn’t a date. \u0027For him to be so arrogant that he didn’t even internalize the problem when I said something to him about it last year is obnoxious and probably a subconscious power thing if we’re getting deep.\u0027TOM LEONARD: Bloody hypocrites of Hollywood are in a rage...AOC dons a CAPE and dresses in white to honor the...Share this articleSilverman says that this was her last mammogram with this \u0027dude\u0027 or \u0027any dude\u0027 for that matter.    \u0027I’m a grown woman and I’m fine. But this guy does this with everyone and I know that personally it took many years into adulthood before I spoke up for myself. \u0027It’s uncomfortable and too easy to think it’s all in your head. And arrogant f**ks like this doctor take advantage of women’s socialized instinct to not speak up.\u0027She then offers a message to her fans. \u0027All this to say speak up.

And so that\u0027s really what we\u0027re trying to accomplish with the Green New Deal.\u0027 The congresswoman who goes by her initials, AOC, said she\u0027d be willing to get behind a \u0027massive government intervention\u0027 and has \u0027no problem saying that\u0027 to the old guard and free-market conservatives.\u0027We have tried their approach for 40 years.

Reality stars leak stories to gossip mags, NOT Royal onesA few weeks away from the birth of your first child, what would be your priorities?Any normal woman would be debating what pain management to choose, whether to opt for a water birth, and finalising names.Not the Duchess of Sussex. Meghan seems to have one objective as she awaits the arrival of the latest member of the Royal family in April - a determination to correct the rumours and false stories surfacing about everything from her alleged ability to keep key staff, her ‘feud’ with the Duchess of Cambridge to her penchant for 5am emails to Palace underlings.With hormones going haywire, it’s not surprising that pregnant women can get obsessive. Meghan has the added burden of living a pretty solitary existence - its can’t be easy to be on constant show, to be shacked in a relatively small cottage waiting for your first real home together to be completed. One that will be out of London and afford a greater degree of privacy.Meghan can’t pop out for a coffee or a jog without being monitored. It’s something she hasn’t found easy, and who can blame her?Her determination to be ‘normal’- a ‘people’s princess’ if you like, is really just a fantasy which will never be a reality. When the Duchess dared to shut her own car door, security staff weren’t happy - then, we were told the reason why. At every public engagement, if there’s any kind of threat, they have to be ready to throw her swiftly into the back of her vehicle. Armed guards have a pre-determined plan for all her public appearances. Her tactic of wandering into the crowds and getting up close and personal with the public might be great for fans and good for her image, but all it needs is one stray nutter and Meghan could be in serious danger.That’s just one of the reasons why her security staff have been leaving. As for the 5am emails - why can’t she just keep them as drafts and press send at 8am? It’s less passive-aggressive.In her latest bid to convince us all that she’s normal, just like the rest of us, Meghan has apparently allowed five of her closest female friends to talk to People magazine.          Britain\u0027s Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, (R) and Britain\u0027s Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (C) meet guests pre-ceremony reception as they attend the annual Endeavour Fund Awards at Drapers Hall in London          Britain\u0027s Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and his wife the Duchess have been heavily featured in the press since their relationship began - with much of it coming from Meghan\u0027s own familyUnfortunately, this tactic has backfired, because now she sounds like a less-than-credible cross between Mother Theresa, Princess Diana at her most saint-like and Mary Berry.According to her pals, Meghan (apart from her wedding day) does her own makeup, paints her own nails, chooses her clothes, and styles herself. I almost expected to hear the Duchess is a dab hand with a needle and takes up her own hems! She’s described as ‘very self-service’.Apparently, this paragon of modern feminism cooks for Harry every day (not too hard if you’re only eating vegetables, drinking mineral water and making vegan smoothies from kale).Samantha Markle calls out sister Meghan for \u0027bulls***\u0027 story...\u0027Please stop victimizing me, Dad\u0027: Meghan sent her estranged...The Royal pardon me! Teenager stuns Harry and Meghan as he...Share this articleThe couple do not have a butler or a chef and their cottage is described as ‘cosy’. When a friend came to stay, Meghan lit a candle in her bedroom, provided slippers and a bathrobe. When her dogs get dirty, she wipes them down herself with towels. All of the above is pretty normal behaviour, but the fact that the Duchess wants to share these intimate details of her day to day life with us is charming, but irrelevant.Fact - she wears thousands of pounds-worth of designer clothes and shoes that cost £500 a pair, teamed with handbags that are equally chic. For all the talk about ‘normality’ she is married to a member of the aristocracy, a multimillionaire, a chap who doesn’t have to get up in the morning and go to an office - and shows no sign of doing so out of choice.I applaud the couple’s determination to give something back to society, to help the under privileged, but to push their lifestyle as humdrum and normal is rather nauseating. The public are not that gullible!As for her troubled relationship with her father letting us know that she wrote him a letter asking him to stop ‘victimising’ her and revealing that he even asked her to pose for pictures with him is far too much detail.          Janet Street-Porter: \u0027Her determination to be ‘normal’- a ‘people’s princess’ if you like, is really just a fantasy which will never be a reality\u0027Even the most hardened republican surely feels sympathy for this poor young woman with such ghastly relatives. Her horrible half-sister and half brother are total idiots. He was in court this week, charged with driving under the influence and snotty half-sister Samantha was telling the press Meghan was a ‘wealthy narcissist’ suffering from ‘lie-abetes’.The final proof that Megan is determined to follow poor Diana down the path of saintly martyrdom, is the hot news that she’s become close friends with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. According to her female pals, she has ‘a huge loving fondness’ for the leader of the Church of England. A friend says ‘we can be modern women…strong moms and strong wives, but understand that (our) relationship with God is so critical’. Pass the sickbag, I don’t think I can stomach any more of this faux-perfection.All these revelations make me feel inadequate. I just can’t measure up to this perfect example of a modern feminist. At the back of my mind, though, there lurks a big question - clearly, Meghan has dispensed with the services of a Press Officer on this occasion - and that is clear a sign of insecurity.There’s a good reason why the palace hire highly skilled PR people - it’s to say less, not more. To retain an air of mystique, not a warts and all running commentary on their lives of privilege.I imagine the Queen is appalled by the twaddle in People magazine, it runs counter to everything she believes in.Couldn’t Meghan learn to act a little bit more (dare I say it?) REGAL? Keep her mouth shut, rise above common gossip, ignore her ghastly family. Blabbing is what we expect from reality stars, not members of the poshest family in Britain. "},{"url":null,"title":"Project Runway host Nina Garcia reveals underwent double mastectomy","story":"    Announcement: Nina Garcia (above in Los Angeles last week) posted a letter on the Elle website on Thursday revealing she recently had a preventative double mastectomy          Veteran: The fashion editor will be making her return to Project Runway this month as the show is back on Bravo with Karlie Kloss and former winner Christian Siriano (l to r: Brandon Maxwell, Karlie Kloss, Christian Siriano, Garcia and Elaine Welteroth)Garcia revealed that this decision was four years in the making, beginning back in 2015 when she had genetic testing to determination if she had mutations to the BRCA genes, which increase the risks of some cancers including breast and ovarian.\u0027To my surprise, I received an envelope containing the results, stating that I did in fact have a mutation and was at high risk for breast cancer,\u0027 said Garcia.In the years since, Garcia said she stayed on top of the situation, which required her to endure a litany of tests and procedures.\u0027Throughout this time, I’ve had numerous biopsies, two lumpectomies, and countless follow-ups.

especially near the border with Northern Ireland - and on smaller businesses that are more dependent on trade with Britain and Northern Ireland. Measures are being introduced to try and avert shortages of food or medicine, as the document warned a no-deal Brexit could \u0027affect supply chains and the cost andor availability of imports from the UK\u0027.                                                     Number 10 sources acknowledged there were still \u0027very considerable points of difference\u0027 with Labour over the blueprint -

which has been working since the summer and is in close contact with the Bank of England - range from cutting taxes and boosting investment to slashing tariffs.\u0027It\u0027s basically a Doomsday list of economic levers we could pull if the economy is about to tank,\u0027 one Whitehall source is quoted as saying.In her meetings in Brussels yesterday, Mrs May won a commitment from European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker that their teams will carry on talking in an effort to find an agreed solution that can command support in the Commons.Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will hold talks with the EU\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday and Mrs May and Mr Juncker have agreed to meet again before the end of the month to take stock of the situation.The EU side remains adamant it will not re-open the Withdrawal Agreement while European Council president Donald Tusk said there was \u0027no breakthrough in sight\u0027.However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel was more encouraging, suggesting that a deal was possible without re-opening the Withdrawal Agreement.\u0027Of course its also our duty to get such an agreement -

Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana faced a boycott in China - the luxury world\u0027s number one market by a long shot - after one of its designers insulted Chinese people in a private chat over promotional videos featuring a Chinese model struggling to eat Italian food with chopsticks, which was seen as culturally insensitive.  Lee donned Gucci on the Venice Film Festival red carpet last September (above), following up with a stop by the Prada womenswear preview show in Milan later in the month decked out in a black Prada suitCommenting on the controversies during New York Fashion Week, model Cipriana Quann said the offending designs suggested a lack of ersity within the companies, not just in the design studios but also the board rooms and on the runways.\u0027When the company is not erse, so they\u0027re not inclusive,\u0027 the model said. \u0027So, the more erse your company, the more you\u0027ll be able to catch those cultural appropriation screw ups.\u0027\u0027So, you need to see it across the map. So not only in the boardroom. On the runway, even in street-style photography, not photographing women that are only homogenous in looks, you need ersity as well. In every aspect,\u0027 she said.While design houses have creative directors whose put their faces on the collections - Alessandro Michele at Gucci and Miuccia Prada at her brand - they work with considerable design teams behind the scenes.Also in New York, Japanese-American designer Tadashi Shoji said that the brands appeared to be lacking in cultural sensitivity.\u0027What are they thinking as a designer in the business?

The subject of books, documentaries and endless tributes, he is almost bigger in death than he was in life.As GQ Editor Dylan Jones, the author of one of these books, says, Bowie is a ‘continually expanding balloon that refuses to burst’.All of which makes the recollection of Bowie as a middle-aged seducer of teenage groupies, shared via a podcast by comedian David Baddiel, feel wildly jarring.Baddiel said last weekend that he was told the story by one of his female friends about a ‘romance’ with Bowie while the singer and Mick Jagger were holidaying in Mustique. He said: ‘This woman was 16 at the time and Bowie would have been in his 40s.She and her best friend had one of many drinking nights with Bowie and ended up back at their shack with David.‘David was clearly keen on a threesome and had put some work in to create it. The way he did this, according to her, was to take all his clothes off and put Let’s Dance on cassette and dance naked.‘It worked for David as both the girls got naked. There were sexual goings-on but she didn’t sleep with David. I said: “Why on earth would you not want to lose your virginity to David Bowie?” She replied: “It wouldn’t mean anything to him. I didn’t want to do that for him, just one night.”          Bowie was said to have slept with a 16-year-old girl while on holiday in the Caribbean island of Mustique‘Instead she went outside. David did s*** the friend, then came out and tried to make it all right with her because she was a bit p***** off.’Bowie fans already knew about the wild times in the early Seventies — to be clear, it’s not illegal to sleep with a 16-year-old — but was he really in the habit of seducing teenagers when he was middle aged?It appears so. Put simply, Bowie was described by his friends as a ‘sex addict’ with a catalogue of lovers old and young, male and female, and a tremendous appetite for all.This week, the Mail has spoken to two women who were under the age of consent when they slept with Bowie. Lori Mattix, who had a liaison with him aged 15, explained: ‘I never thought of David Bowie as a paedophile. He would f**k anything. If he liked it he would f**k it.’          Lori Mattix, who had a liaison with him aged 15Early girlfriend Dana Gillespie concurred, telling me: ‘As far as sex went, if it moved, he was there. Man, woman, old or young. Times have changed and it doesn’t always look so good in black and white now, but in those days we were just having fun there were no rules.’It’s a matter of record that he dallied with famous women including Charlie Chaplin’s widow Oona, 22 years older, and actress Bette Midler, plus Bianca Jagger, Susan Sarandon and Lulu.There were always rumours of some kind of liaison with his friend and friendly rival Mick Jagger, and he also had affairs with male mime artist Lindsay Kemp and Natasha Korniloff, Kemp’s costume designer — at the same time. Finding out he was two-timing them, both attempted suicide.Sometimes, having sex was a way of gain an advantage. Former wife Angie said: ‘Using sex was what David did. He used sex to endear himself to people, so they loved him and did things for him and worked hard to promote him. It was the pure selfishness of wanting to succeed.’But at other times, his promiscuity seemed more simply a habit which he enjoyed too much to consider amending.As he said in a 1997 radio interview: ‘I was hitting on everybody. I had a wonderfully irresponsible promiscuous time.’The sexual free-for-all characterised his open marriage to Angie, whom he wed in 1970. She wrote in her autobiography: ‘David made a virtual religion of slipping the lance of love into almost everyone around him.’ Some lovers they shared, others they did not. By his 1972 tour of America he was with Cyrinda Foxe, a 19-year-old model. She recalled that he sent for her while he was having sex with a groupie because he needed someone to talk to. Former assistant Tony Zanetta said David had sex with Puerto Rican transsexuals while in New York.

After the set he came up behind her and brushed her hair, and then asked if he could come home with her (she later worked out that this was because he was going to miss the last train back to Bromley.)They made love. She was 14, and he was 17.Dana told me: ‘I have never thought of David as someone who liked young girls in particular. He liked bright women.‘It has been suggested to me that him sleeping with me when I was 14 was “statutory rape” but I have said to writers, look, you can’t put that in because, yes, I was young but we were just having fun.‘He would play my guitar and listen to my songs, and play me his. I remember he once phoned me up to tell me that he had just written Space Oddity. He wrote the song Andy Warhol for me.‘We were friends for the first ten years of his career, I didn’t see him really after 1975. I wouldn’t call myself a girlfriend, we did all of that and got it out of our system.‘It was not the kind of relationship where I would ever have wanted to be Mrs Bowie.‘When I was 15 or 16 I would hear from him every three or four months. He would come round and I would cook him brown rice and vegetables because he wasn’t eating properly. I remember once he came round and said that his heart was a bit broken because he had trouble with Hermione (Farthingale, his ballet dancer girlfriend.)‘He did not talk about the emotional stuff, I guess you could say that he was a rather cold character because everything came second to ambition.’As David became more famous, he caught the attention of the notorious ‘baby groupies’ who were on the scene in Los Angeles at the time.Led by Californian wild child Sable Starr, who had a romance with Iggy Pop when she was 13, the girls competed to bed visiting British stars.One of their number was Lori Maddox, also known as Lori Mattix. She was 14 when she first met Bowie at the E Club on Sunset Strip and was working as a model. He was on his Spiders From Mars tour of 1972.She turned him down that night, but five months later Bowie returned to LA and she was called by his bodyguard, Stuey.She and friend Sable Starr went for dinner with Bowie at the Rainbow Bar \u0026amp Grill, and then back to his suite at the Beverly Hilton. Lori recalls that Bowie walked her through to the bathroom, stripped off his kimono and climbed into the tub with her. Then she says, he took her virginity. Later she had her first threesome, with Bowie and Sable (who died aged only 51). Lori was 15.Now she reflects on the episode with satisfaction. She said this week: ‘I don’t even think he thought about my age, he was so anti-social and breaking boundaries everywhere.‘I don’t think it was a thought for him and I don’t think he was hanging out with a lot of underage people. We were young then and he was 25, that is still young as well.‘The rockers must have known we were underage girls, maybe that was part of it for them, the innocence, I don’t know.    David Bowie married supermodel Iman in a private ceremony in Switzerland back in 1992‘David was so gentle and kind with me when we were together. It could have been some creepy guy who threw me on the bed and like raped me. It was a different thing, he took me by the hand and was a gentleman. He was a fascinating creature. Was I supposed to do it with some Algebra teacher in the back of his van? I was the last of the virgins at my school, too.‘Do I regret it? No, life goes on. I am 60 years old and it was 45 years ago. People should get over it. You go through a journey in life, I don’t believe in mistakes, I believe there is a destiny for everybody.‘David was not a star yet so he did not take advantage of any celebrity with me. I remained friends with him throughout his rise to fame and he would always check in with me to see how I was doing in my life. We were friends.‘I was a teen model. David was very androgynous and he liked to be around cool and interesting looking people. It was all pure fun. It was a different time in rock ’n’ roll. We did not have internet or cell phones or anything like that.‘He was attracted to that glam rock scene out here where we were all cheating and being unacceptable. It was all good, pure fun. I do not feel like I was taken advantage of, not at all. We were all just hanging out.’ She added: ‘He was fascinating for anybody. David was an anomaly, he was just not normal. He had carrot red hair, no eyebrows, he was magnificently beautiful, the skin, the cheekbones, those two different coloured eyes.

They talk with Winners Take All author Anand Giridharadas about why change is comingRutger: Winnie, why did the comments you and I made about billionaires and taxes at Davos go viral? Why do things seem to be changing right now?Winnie: Why did we go viral? I think we said things that people have wanted to hear, especially on a big stage where powerful politicians and companies are represented. And they are rarely said. People go there and speak in coded words and praise themselves and spin out the stats that suit them, but for once we spoke plainly about the challenges that people face.R: I saw some interesting stats today from Gallup that suggest that since the end of the 1990s, the vast majority of people in the US have wanted the rich to pay more taxes. There are signs that there is a profound shift in the public mood.W: I don’t know whether the left has been sleeping, but there has been a dominant narrative that has remained quite unchallenged in the media. This narrative suggests that there is no connection between the super-rich and abject poverty, that you can keep getting richer and richer, and this has nothing to do with people getting poorer. And it wasn’t always like that, people in the past have known that maximising at the top means you are depriving somebody else further down. It’s empowering for people to hear that truth being put on the table again.Anand: The idea of the narrative is so important. I think that what you both found yourselves in the middle of at Davos, and what I found myself in on my book tour over the last few months, and what politicians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have found themselves in the middle of, is the growing challenge to a kind of bullshit narrative around wealth and poverty, access and power it’s completely wrong and fraudulent, and it’s now crashing down. There is a second narrative about how the world is getting better and better: people in India and China and elsewhere have been coming out of poverty, and the world is the best it’s ever been. Never mind the fact that we’re perhaps 50 years away from catastrophic climate change fuelled by greed. That narrative, too, has had a free ride in the press and culture, including on the left, until now. And then there is a final narrative of companies and billionaires – as long as they are doing good things, we don’t ask what else they do as long as they are giving back, we don’t ask how they made their money. It’s like a mafia deal: no questions asked.R: I agree. I think that for a very long time, politicians on both the left and the right have believed that most wealth is created at the top. The brilliant entrepreneurs, the visionaries, they are the job creators. The right says we need to give them all the freedom in the world, wealth will trickle down and everything will be all right. What Winnie pointed out very well in Davos is that most real wealth is actually created at the bottom, by the working and middle classes and at the top there is a huge amount of wealth destruction and exploitation. Entrepreneurs might use the language of entrepreneurialism and hard work, but if you really delve into their business models, you’ll find that they’re not contributing to the common good. They are destroying more than they create. Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and\u0026nbspthe elaborate system of badges\u0026nbspreveals your place in the Davos hierarchy.For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all\u0026nbspa big waste of time.Who is there?More than 2,500 people – business leaders, world leaders, diplomats and the odd celebrity, such as Matt Damon – will fly in for the 49th annual Davos meeting. Most delegates are men, and although the forum boasts delegates from more than 100 countries, most hail from western\u0026nbspEurope, followed by the US. Sir David Attenborough is one of the most notable attendees in 2019, while Donald Trump, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron all pulled out at short notice to focus on more pressing issues at home.A: How did the billionaires pull this off? How is it that they conquered the realm of ideas so successfully and what do you think we need to do to win the battle of ideas in the coming years?W: I was a student in the UK when Margaret Thatcher set out to crush the unions. There was a new language at that time: the message was that if you are poor you are not working hard enough. You had to be a winner and if you were not, it was your fault. Ordinary working people were put on the defensive. But there are hardly any people now who see themselves reaching the top. The top involves a tiny number of such very rich people it’s unreal. So ordinary people are saying: “Wait a moment, we are in the majority, down here, and our lives are not like that.”R: There is a depressing finding by researchers at the LSE: in a survey of 23 western countries since the 1980s, it was discovered that, as they became more unequal, their populations actually believed more strongly that people at the top were there because they worked the hardest.A: I think in many ways the forces of plutocracy and of conservatism have been better than progressives at understanding the importance of cultivating ideas. And a big part of ideas is language. I want to give some examples of the conquest of language – words that everybody uses, not just plutocrats, but that end up doing the plutocrats’ bidding. One is “win-win”. That phrase sounds great. Who could be against win-win? But, in fact, win-win is a darkly powerful way of suggesting that the only kind of progress worth having is the kind that lets the winners win – in tandem, supposedly, with empowering others.W: Yes, we were told that globalisation was a win-win. It’s a situation where everyone is a winner and no one is a loser. In America no one even wants to say they are working class. They want to be called middle class. People feel that the right thing is to identify with the winners and that has masked many problems.A: A couple more examples. Take “thought leader”. When you were both in Davos, you were surrounded by thought leaders, who are actually people who don’t say what they truly think: they are the ones who say nice things about the powerful and keep getting invited back. Why you two made such a splash is that you refused to be thought leaders, you behaved like thinkers, which is something those people don’t expect. Another instance is “doing well by doing good”: it sounds positive but it really is about putting the people who are trying to make money in charge of changing a status quo they have no interest in changing. And then there are terms such as “social impact” and “social venture capital” and “impact investing”. They are ways of encouraging us not to use words like “power” and “justice” and “dignity”. They are an attempt to make us not speak about unions and taxes.W: I have been attending climate change negotiations since 2007 or 2008, and am always frustrated that you can not use the term “climate justice”. You can talk about “climate change”, but you cannot say it is an injustice, even though the people who are facing the worst consequences are poor people. And they are not the ones who caused it. The negotiators prefer “climate action”, and the idea that we all have to do it together, that kind of happy happy language. We don’t place the responsibility where it lies.R: I really like your point about the importance of ideas, especially on the right. People often focus on Thatcher or Ronald Reagan, but what we often forget is that this thing called neoliberalism actually started in the 1950s. Figures such as Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek gathered as part of the influential think tank the Mont Pelerin Society and, back then, these were the real radicals almost everyone else was a socialist or a social democrat. So they said to themselves we have to start developing ideas. We are the resistance now, we need to start building institutions, develop a new narrative, and wait for a moment when the current system crashes – or at least doesn’t work as well any more. This is exactly what happened during the 1970s with the oil crisis, with inflation, with strikes by workers in the west. More and more people began to think that the economic system wasn’t working. And that’s when Thatcher and Reagan came on stage with these supposedly new ideas that had in fact been developed over 30 years. When, after the financial crash of 2008, it became obvious that neoliberalism was founded on a huge amount of bullshit, the problem was that there seemed to be no alternative. The left was against a lot of things: austerity homophobia racism the establishment. But you also need to know what you are for. A few years ago I argued that we needed to have a Mont Pelerin of progressives, to start developing ideas that might seem utterly utopian now but could become a reality in the future. I didn’t expect back then to be invited to Davos, of all places, to talk about basic income, nor that I would go viral with a speech about taxes, taxes, taxes. It has been really interesting how quickly things have changed.Again, in relation to the past, there is the importance of the cold war, capitalism v communism. I’ve often thought social democrats in a way depended on there being communism further to the left. Then, with the defeat of that communism and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the “end of history” was proclaimed, and politics was just going to become technocracy – win-win. What has been happening now is that there is a new generation that’s not traumatised by the cold war. I’ve heard this in Davos as well: you talk about taxes and some of the billionaires say, “Oh that sounds like Venezuela” – Michael Bloomberg recently said it. But now there is a new generation that says: “Whatever.”A: I’ve met more people on my book tour in the last five months than I’ve ever met before in my life. And the big thing I’ve found is that the conversation no longer revolves around capitalism v gulags. When Bill Gates was asked in Davos about my book, he seemed to insinuate that I was a communist, even though he had blurbed it a year before. I think most people now understand that this “There is no alternative” talk is bullshit. An understanding seems to be rising that it’s not about left v right or communism v capitalism any more, but about humanism v plutocracy.R: One thing I’ve been doing is to use a different kind of language, one that centres on basic income for everyone and higher taxes on the rich. Often people on the left use the language of care, or they say something is just immoral or this is unjust. And yes, there is a certain part of the population that is receptive to this kind of language. But there is another part of the population that doesn’t really like that language. Also, impoverished people never like being talked down to.One thing to do is to take back the win-win language and use it for something else. For example, doing something about poverty – there’s a lot of research that shows eradicating poverty is an investment that pays for itself. You spend less on healthcare costs, you spend less on crime, kids will do better in school, so that is a win-win policy. Also, history shows the most fundamental innovation has come about through government spending. The iPhone is a perfect example: every fundamental technology that has gone through the iPhone touchscreen, the battery, the mobile technology – it has all been invented by researchers on the government payroll. In the 1980s and 90s it became fashionable to think of the government as inherently wasteful. But new research has been conducted by two Dutch economists, who asked 27,000 people in 37 countries: do you think your job is actually valuable? It turns out a quarter think their job doesn’t add anything of value. And four times as many people think that in the private sector as in the public sector. The more valuable jobs, such as caring for other people, police officers, fire fighters, you name it, are in the public sector. It’s possible to take the whole narrative of wasteful jobs and turn it around.W: Yes, at Oxfam we call it a human economy, and we try to paint a picture of what that could look like. We begin with what is wrong now, showing that the super-rich don’t just spend on priceless works of art, but also use that money to buy the public voice, buy the media, buy impunity from justice, buy the policy process, to bribe congressmen and women. I call it bribing, they call it lobbying. We show wealth at the top is being used to take away your voice, your rights, the policies that would work for you. I find that this shocks people – they start by thinking that the rich are just enjoying their money, snorting cocaine. Then they actually realise they are using that money to disempower ordinary people. For example, we can express the amount of money governments lose from billionaires’ tax dodging in terms of the number of nurses. Supposing we said: “x-billionaire dodged some 50,000 nurses”. We use that kind of language – it’s emotive, it has an impact on people.A: In the US the right has been better at using the kind of emotive language you describe. For example, the estate tax, which in any version of it only affects a very small number of estates at the top: it was brilliantly rebranded as the death tax. If you call it a death tax you create the feeling among people that their very mortality is being interfered with by the government. People who want more equality and more justice need to get more imaginative with language.R: Here’s an idea: I think we should call it a laziness tax. That’s basically what it is. You have a huge class of people who haven’t actually done any real work themselves or contributed in any meaningful way to societies. They were just born into certain families. I’ve also been trying to reframe basic income as pro-work. It’s “venture capitalism for the people”, to use a Silicon Valley phrase. Everyone wants the ability to make different choices, to move to a different city, start a new company. I dislike the left v right axis, but you often can’t get around it.A: I was listening to an extraordinary conversation Ocasio-Cortez had with the American writer Ta‑Nehisi Coates in a church a couple of weeks ago for Martin Luther King Day. Ocasio-Cortez made the point that elected officials like her are really followers rather than leaders. She said: “Part of the job of elected public office is translating public will into the law of the land. Who shapes, who directs and who moves that public will? Writers, journalists, activists, artists.” And that is so true. It was the job of Upton Sinclair to show what the slaughterhouses were actually like, and what labouring conditions were actually like, and then politicians made laws to improve things. It has been such a grim time for journalism, for books and many of these other things, in part, because of plutocrats and the monopolistic world they have built. But I come to this conversation so optimistic about the power of ideas and books right now. I feel like what we are witnessing is a profound cultural turning point in relation to these issues, caused by activists, artists and writers who are changing what the public wants by telling honest stories.W: Stories are my biggest weapon. Oxfam works in more than 90 countries around the world, and people respond to stories very strongly.R: I’m 30 years old. I’ve been writing for seven or eight years now. And never before have I had such a strong feeling that the zeitgeist is really shifting and now you can talk about things that were simply not possible just a couple of years ago. It seems like the window of what is politically possible is just opening up, or that what they call the Overton window is shifting. Ideas, according to theory that originated with political scientist Joseph Overton, are seen as somehow acceptable to discuss at a certain creative time, and the real political challenge is to move the window. The people behind such a shift are never politicians or mainstream writers, they are the radicals – those who are often seen as naive or bizarre, people who make you uncomfortable and angry. And they often pay a high price for doing this hard work. There are many examples throughout history, whether we are talking about the fight against slavery, or women fighting for the right to vote, or the establishment of the welfare state. Ideas that were first dismissed as ridiculous or too expensive or dangerous became the bedrock of civilisation. W: I hope that’s true.R: I think that hope is exactly the right word, because I never really like the word optimism. Optimism gives you the feeling that, “Oh everything will be all right, just sit down, enjoy the ride – all the trains are good.” But hope is fundamentally different, another world is possible but not inevitable.W: Do you think the racists, the misogynists, feel that they are being pushed back or do they feel they can assert themselves and make their reality the norm?A: My view from the US, and I bet it’s true in Britain to a certain extent, is that you have two big things happening to a lot of white working-class communities. On the one hand, they have been victims of a great plutocratic theft, like everybody else over the last generation. To the extent that they feel like they can’t raise children who will have a better life than them, they can’t get the kind of education that gives them a piece of the dream, they can’t have the kind of healthcare that allows them to not think about healthcare all the time, they feel that theft.The problem is that those people also feel a second theft, which is not actually a theft, which is the rise of women and minorities, and immigrants and African Americans. In fact that’s not a theft at all, it’s a wave of rising equality it is justice. But I think we have to accept that the psychological experience of this change may also be felt as a theft. What Donald Trump did is to exploit the pain caused by the real theft, and to ert blame for it on to the non-theft. He made it all about the cultural ascendancy of others – they are the ones who stole the dream from you.And instead of encouraging people to punch up at the powerful, he encouraged them to punch out, at women and minorities and the Other. I think the political challenge for us is to go to those communities and not to pander but to speak compellingly to both of those experiences of feeling wary of the future, and to identify the real reasons why it has happened. Now, before we go, I want to see if the three of us can make a case for hope. All three of us have been pushing a certain rock up a hill, and suddenly the slope seems to be becoming more hospitable. What do you want to see happen?R: If you ask people from around the globe in what kind of country they would like to live, almost everyone says: “Somewhere like Sweden.” Much less inequality, more rights for workers, higher taxes on the rich, it doesn’t really matter whether you are asking people on the left or right, it’s pretty much the same everywhere. So there is huge potential. You only need to find a way to draw on that political energy. There was one political advertisement by Bernie Sanders, in 2016, that I really like, called Together. In it he says: “We should not allow them to define us.” The whole purpose of the campaign was to bring people together – black, white, men, women, that doesn’t matter. I think this is the very simple message that we need to keep on communicating: don’t allow them to ide us.W: We must go out and mobilise and create new norms, and say, for instance, that it’s wrong for people not to have help when they are sick, they should have free healthcare. That idea was alive after the second world war. Everyone all over the world understood and agreed that healthcare should be a right. What I’m hopeful about is there is such anger at the few who are running away with wealth and power, these monopolies, these big tech companies taking our information, not paying their taxes. So much concentration of wealth and injustice by those few at the top. That is going to help us to shift the norm back to what is good for society, a human economy that works for all, a society that cares for all, including those who may not be able to work and earn. We are now a movement building. • Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World by Anand Giridharadas is published by Allen Lane.

Find the right word, put it down.3 Finish what you\u0027re writing. Whatever you have to do to finish it, finish it.4 Put it aside. Read it pretending you\u0027ve never read it before. Show it to friends whose opinion you respect and who like the kind of thing that this is.5 Remember: when people tell you something\u0027s wrong or doesn\u0027t work for them, they are almost always right. When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it, they are almost always wrong.6 Fix it. Remember that, sooner or later, before it ever reaches perfection, you will have to let it go and move on and start to write the next thing. Perfection is like chasing the horizon. Keep moving.7 Laugh at your own jokes.8 The main rule of writing is that if you do it with enough assurance and confidence, you\u0027re allowed to do whatever you like. (That may be a rule for life as well as for writing. But it\u0027s definitely true for writing.) So write your story as it needs to be written. Write it ­honestly, and tell it as best you can. I\u0027m not sure that there are any other rules. Not ones that matter.MissLupescu has a question on behalf of their 10-year-old son:Have you any plans to write any more children’s books?He loves that you narrate your audio books and his pronunciation of Norse words far surpasses mine now, thanks to your storytelling skills.Yes!

If so, how does it feel to see another story using concepts that seem so original to your work in a story?I have. I loved it. And when I met George Saunders (oddly enough, in a men\u0027s restroom in Santa Barbara) he told me that he\u0027d read the Graveyard Book to his kids, and that it had helped him write Lincoln in the Bardo. Which just made me even happier.I like it when I see things I came up with used elsewhere. Terry Pratchett used to say that literature was a stew. As a young writer, you ladle stuff out of the communal stewpot. As an older writer sometimes you realise you\u0027ve added a few leeks, several carrots, a potato and a turnip to the stew that it didn\u0027t contain before. The stew bubbles on.I’ve often heard you say that the famous ‘dragons’ quote isn’t actually Chesterton… Were you paraphrasing, or did you make it up entirely? I quote it often and would like to know who to attribute it to. Thanks!(The quote is: “Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.”)I was paraphrasing a much longer Chesterton passage from an essay in Tremendous Trifles. When I started writing Coraline, I wrote my version of the quote in Tremendous Trifles, meaning to go back later and find the actual quote, as I didn’t own the book, and this was before the Internet. And then ten years went by before I finished the book, and in the meantime I had completely forgotten that the Chesterton quote was mine and not his. (I’m perfectly happy for anyone to attribute it to either of us. The sentiment is his, the phrasing is mine.)Would you ever consider touring for high schools in America, and teaching students about writing, or creating stories?Having kids means that you wind up in their schools, talking about what you do. Which is always a delight. I\u0027ve been teaching at Bard College for the last 6 years, along with teaching a couple of Clarion SFF workshops (sort of a 6 week bootcamp for writers) and love the teaching process. It was why I agreed to teach a MasterClass. But the problem with teaching is when you are teaching you aren\u0027t writing. And I need to do more writing...A little preview of Neil’s MasterClass:Hi! I can’t make it to the webchat as it will be 3AM, Tassie time, but I’d love to ask Neil for his favourite book recommendations by children’s authors, women authors and people of colour, and if he’d like to share any little-known authors he adores - ones who haven’t made the big time, but who he considers worthy of great things. Thank you for taking the time, Neil!My favourite writer of children\u0027s fiction is Diana Wynne Jones. I don\u0027t know if she\u0027s well-known or not, but she\u0027s marvellous, and I still miss her. There are so many fantastic writers out there, so I\u0027ll pick a few rather than turn this into a huge name-list. Nalo Hopkinson and Nnedi Okorafor are wonderful writers of colour (oddly, Diana Wynne Jones put me in touch with Nnedi, well over a decade ago). Margo Lanagan is an astonishing Australian writer who deserves to be better known. And Cold Comfort Farm, by Stella Gibbons, is one the finest and funniest pieces of near-future fiction from long ago.KatyaB, who is writing their dissertation on Gaiman’s books, asks:Do you think fantasy is important for helping people understand themselves?I think it\u0027s important for a thousand reasons, and one of them is understanding ourselves. Another, just as important is understanding other people. And understanding the world we are in is a third. And the great thing about the fantastic as a tool is it allows you to change things, reflect things, play with things, isolate things, and make people think things they haven\u0027t thought before.A friend asked my opinion of their manuscript. It isn’t great. I’m too nervous of upsetting them to be completely honest with my feedback. How do you deal with providing criticism, especially if it’s somebody you know?I try to find out what they want first. Some people want rip it to shreds criticism. Some people want fulsome praise. Some want something between the two.And writers are fragile. Budding writers doubly so. Say the wrong thing and they may go off and become trombone players or meteorologists.Mostly I try and encourage. Any written novel gets a writer closer to getting a book published than a novel they only ever think about. And mostly what young writers need to do is write the next thing. So I never feel dishonest when my feedback is where\u0027s the next chapter?.Why did you decide to have Lucifer end Seasons of Mists on a beach in Perth?It was far away from the England I lived in, and the beaches faced west.When you write a story with someone, how does it change your perception of them? Are people very different once you write together?Not really. But there\u0027s a special feeling to making something up with someone else that I don\u0027t really know any equivalent to in any other field.And by the same token, when you stop collaborating and you are suddenly completely in control of the keyboard, that\u0027s magic too.Have seen Coraline in our local theatre, have read the Graveyard book and have read Good Omens (even if not along with the Reading Group but decades ago) - all very different in style. The difference to Good Omens is easy to explain, as that is a book you wrote in collaboration (you do not even know by half how much I envy you for having not only met Sir Terry but also to have been able to work with him).But how come your other stuff is varying so much? When I write stories (no, they are not worth publishing - I just write for my own fun), the tone is mainly the same. How do you develop so many different voices? Is it part of the writing process? Do you sometimes start out in a different style and then rewrite parts later on?That\u0027s a terrific question, and not one I have an easy answer for. Other than, you try and pick the style (or I do, anyway) that\u0027s right for the story you want to tell. American Gods had to be told in a different voice to The Graveyard Book. Coraline needed a different voice to Anansi Boys. Ocean at the End of the lane needed a different voice to Fortunately The Milk, although I wrote them at the same time. Good Omens was a book I started on my own, so the voice -- Classic English Humour Writing -- was there before Terry came on board.I suspect I was spoiled by doing comics when young. The joy of Sandman was it was whatever I wanted it to be that month: ghost story or historical fiction, allegory or horror.Intellectually, I know that I\u0027d probably be more commercially successful if I wrote the same kind of book in the same voice over and over again. But I would get bored by book two, suicidal by book three, and disappear, never to be seen again, half way through book four, if ever I made it that far.There’s always talk about a Sandman series or movie and I have learned to take it with a pinch of salt unless it comes from you yourself. So, is there anything productive happening on that front?There are rumours, but as they used to say when I was growing up, I\u0027ve lived too near the woods too long to be frightened by an owl. There have been rumours for 28 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89cafeab8ce1c4c839dd170780552ad2bffb4538/0_309_4807_2884/master/4807.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aadd160bbc1fb3c842d943d8ea9d7e09","title":"mike ashley bid patisserie valerie sports direct","story":"Sports Direct owner seeks to add collapsed cake chain to recent string of acquisitionsThe sportswear tycoon Mike Ashley has made a surprise bid to add collapsed cake chain Patisserie Valerie to his high-street empire.On Friday evening the Sports Direct boss confirmed in a brief statement to the stock exchange that the company had made an offer for the stricken cake group, which plunged into administration last month.Patisserie Valerie went into a death spiral after the discovery of a £40m black hole in its finances, which it blamed on “potentially fraudulent” accounting irregularities.Last month the cafe group’s administrators, the advisory firm KPMG, closed 71 of its nearly 200 stores and concessions, but had remained hopeful that a buyer would be found for the remaining outlets.Sports Direct is not the only business in contention to acquire Patisserie Valerie. A number of parties are carrying out due diligence before submitting final-round bids. The auction is understood to have attracted a mix of private equity and trade buyers.Costa Coffee – which is now owned by Coca-Cola – plus Caffè Nero and Leon are thought to be interested in parcels of stores, but administrators are hopeful of finding a buyer which will run a significant part of Patisserie Valerie as a going concern. KPMG declined to comment.The original Patisserie Valerie cafe, which has been trading on Old Compton Street in central London since the 1940s, was among the stores that closed and some financial experts had questioned the likelihood of a buyer emerging given the potential irregularities in the accounts.The billionaire missed out this week on the auction of HMV, which was won by Canada’s Sunrise Records. But last week he added the online retailer Sofa to a retail group that now encompasses sportswear, department stores and furniture.“Sports Direct International confirms that it has made an offer to acquire the business comprising the trade and assets of Patisserie Holdings and its group companies out of administration,” the company said.Patisserie Holdings is the parent of Patisserie Valerie as well as the Druckers Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker \u0026amp Spice and Flour Power City brands.Analysts suggest Ashley is trying to assemble a portfolio of brands to sell in House of Fraser stores. A number of brands pulled out after losing millions of pounds when the department store chain went bust last year, leaving gaps in its ranges. Patisserie Valerie had been opening cafes in Debenhams but they were among the sites to close last month.Patisserie Valerie was the jewel in the crown of its chairman, the entrepreneur Luke Johnson. But the appointment of administrators last month wiped the value of Johnson’s and all other shareholders’ investment the stock market-listed business, which was valued at £450m before it flagged up the potential fraud in October.Patisserie Valerie’s finance director, Chris Marsh, was arrested by Hertfordshire police and bailed in October.

But there’s a way to address the fears of all the major playersWhat would prompt an academic from Germany to come up with a plan to try to end the current stalemate on the backstop – the mechanism designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland after Brexit? The answer has three parts: experience in negotiations gained during my time with a multinational company, an academic interest in Brexit since 2016 including a study in which I compared it for complexity with the first moon landing and the third is that I’m a father of two who can vividly imagine the consequences for families on both sides of the UKEU ide if these negotiations fail.My experience of business negotiations in China and Russia convinced me of how crucial trust is. Without it, any negotiation is doomed to failure. You have to put yourself in the shoes of the other side and, tough as that may be, accept that you are not always right. When we look at the deadlock between London and Brussels over the Northern Ireland backstop what we can observe after nearly two years of negotiations is the total breakdown of trust. Once you hear from both sides the words “this is a matter of principle …” you know you are very close to a showdown.London’s position on the backstop is that it has to go, and Brussels’s position is that it’s vital it stays. Consequently, what we have is a game of chicken. With one big difference: it is not a game but a real disaster waiting to happen on 29 March. The major roadblock for avoiding a no-deal Brexit is obviously the backstop. A recent poll published by Paul Goodman at Conservative Home underlines this: “A majority of party members back May’s deal – if changes can be made to the backstop.” At the same time, the EU communicates exactly the opposite: No agreement without a backstop. Or as the European commissioner Frans Timmermans stated: “Let me be extremely clear: there is no way I could live in a situation where we throw Ireland under the bus … As far as the European commission is concerned, the backstop is an essential element for showing to Ireland and to the rest of Europe that we are in this together.”The issue of the backstop has now become the emblem of “we win or you win” the victory a goal in itself. To restore lost trust would take a long time – time that we don’t have. So we should instead focus on the objectives that led to the backstop because right now it is like a car stuck in quicksand that is going to drown all its passengers. Let’s step back from the stalemate, putting our minds in reverse gear, and start from the objectives of all the parties. I will then suggest a concept that I call the (modified) shamrock proposal, since the symbolic plant has only three leaves but my plan tries to take the interests of four parties into account: the UK, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and the EU.These are the main objectives and views of the parties with respect to the backstop, as one can perceive them:• The backstop has to go. A backstop where the EU has the final say with respect to the customsborder situation in Northern Ireland is unacceptable since it would undermine the sovereignty of the UK• Preserve peace in Northern Ireland based on the Good Friday agreement• Freedom to negotiate free trade agreements after leaving the EU, which is not possible under a customs union• Preserve peace in Northern Ireland based on the Good Friday agreementRepublic of Ireland• Preserve peace in Northern Ireland based on the Good Friday agreement• Preserve peace in Northern Ireland based on the Good Friday agreement• Loyalty to the Republic of Ireland• Protect the integrity of the single marketIssues of national sovereignty are among the most sensitive political subjects anywhere. Thus, we have to appreciate that the UK can’t really live with the EU having the final decision-making power over a backstop. This goes to the very core of national sovereignty, which is one of the British government’s real red lines. At the same time, the UK needs to appreciate that Brussels and Dublin need a mechanism that protects the border-free situation and the EU single market. The tragic aspect is that they may in any case come to a joint solution within the next two years that would not require a hard border. However, since neither side trusts the other all thinking seems to lead to paralysis. My proposal tries to take the uniqueness of the Good Friday agreement into account. The agreement gives the citizens of Northern Ireland a unique right of self-determination, allowing them, whenever the majority decides it, to join the Republic of Ireland. My proposal consists of two core elements:2) Between now and 2020 two outcomes emerge: in the first, both parties, the UK and EU, have clarified their future economic and trading relationship in a way that both accept would not require a hard border. Alternatively, there is an agreement for a trade deal that requires a hard border. In this case a referendum takes place in Northern Ireland.To avoid any misunderstanding: this would not be a vote about nationality or the constitutional status of Northern Ireland but a vote on whether Northern Ireland wants to remain within the EU customs area for trade purposes (thus avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland) or whether it prefers to exit along with the rest of the UK, with a customs arrangement that requires a border. Is it feasible that a territory which is constitutionally part of one country be a member of the customs territory of another? Yes, it is and it has worked in the past. If you look up the history of the Kleinwalsertal of Austria you will find that for many years it was part of the customs territory of Germany, while never questioning the Austrian nationality of its inhabitants. The reason was quite simple because of the Alps, the valley could only be accessed from the German side. Today it is no longer necessary since Austria is part of the EU.The first advantage of such a vote is that it takes the backstop decision out of the hands of the EU and gives it to UK citizens (ie, the people of Northern Ireland), thereby addressing the valid sovereignty concern. The second advantage is time. We gain time to find a joint and mutually acceptable solution without the need for a hard border.What are the disadvantages? There would certainly be arguments against involving the citizens of Northern Ireland (eg, that such a vote could let the genie of nationality or Irish unity out of the bottle). However, the genie is already out of the bottle, and come 29 March it may become much more acute than today.And what if there was a referendum and the people of Northern Ireland voted for a hard border? First, the likelihood is not very high, given the positive effects from the Good Friday agreement. And second, consider the following: the negative near-term effects of a no-deal Brexit far outweigh the more remote risk at the end of 2020.This proposal is certainly not perfect, but when you think about it, the people of Northern Ireland already have the right to self-determination and they could exercise this right at any given point in time. Based on the above, a future vote on the border issue is an element of self-determination, a vote that may not even be necessary in 2020.But right now, it could be decisive in eliminating the backstop, avoiding a no-deal Brexit and preserving peace. • Roland Alter is a professor of risk assessment at the University of Heilbronn, Germany"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6cd6c6aadacb2adf85d2f76a113f057b465da79/0_140_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ddff482fb9a339f9f4a231375e002e5","title":"peoples vote brexit referendum","story":"Sounding the klaxon and warning of imminent disaster is, it turns out, an even older British tradition than you might think. A tour of the spellbinding Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms exhibition at the British Library confirms that back in the year 540, a scribbling sermoniser by the name of Gildas – surely the  columnist of his day – was writing “on the ruin of Britain”. Even before the country properly existed, there were Cassandras to prophesy its demise.Still, that same exhibition leaves the visitor in no doubt that what will befall these islands in less than 50 days is of epic significance, breaking a thread that has run through our long history. Even in the age of Mercia, the kingdom strained hard to connect with its neighbours in “Francia”, Rome and Ireland. The 10th-century court of Æthelstan was a cosmopolitan magnet to scholars from all over the continent. And need we mention that the Anglo-Saxons were themselves migrants from northern Europe? The Faragiste tendency, which imagines a British past pure and unsullied by the taint of Europe, imagines a past that did not exist.So there should be no apologies for clanging the church bells and crying havoc at the prospect of Brexit on 29 March. Viewed one way, that date became a tad less scary this week, thanks to Jeremy Corbyn, whose letter to Theresa May, offering Labour approval for an exit path out of the EU via a permanent customs union, makes a no-deal crash-out less likely. For inching us away from that catastrophe, Corbyn deserves credit. On the other hand, for inching us closer to Brexit happening at all, and with Labour’s blessing, he deserves blame.This was May’s game all along: to keep dangling the lunacy of no deal over our heads until an agreed Brexit looked sane by comparison.But it’s not sane. Even the softest, mildest Brexit-with-a-deal represents an act of national folly that would have had Cnut shaking his head in disbelief. Take a look at Labour’s demands – alignment with the single market and on workers’ rights along with a say over EU trade deals – and realise that these are the things we already have under our current deal, namely EU membership. The very best that can be said for Labour’s Brexit is that it will only be much worse than the status quo rather than much, much worse. (Don’t hold your breath to see that line in the next manifesto.)No one can make a positive case for it, listing the concrete benefits it will bring – because it won’t bring any, and certainly not “the exact same benefits” of EU membership that Labour once, delusionally, promised. The government’s own figures show that Brexit in whatever form will make us poorer. (Norway plus would be a less painful Brexit but it would also be a pointless one.) It means pro-Europeans are left banking on May and her party rejecting the Labour offer – fleeing from the customs union proposal because it won’t allow us to make our own trade deals. (As if, solo, post-Brexit Britain will match the clout that saw the EU strike the deal with Japan that came into force this month, creating a massive free trade area that will combine a market of 500 million consumers with the world’s third-biggest economy.)If May does reject the Labour offer of a joint, bipartisan Brexit, pro-Europeans are banking on Corbyn and John McDonnell finally keeping their word and honouring Labour party policy by backing a second referendum. From the start, the people’s vote strategy has been to wait patiently until all other options are exhausted, at which point MPs, out of alternatives and at the very last minute, will realise the train is about to crash and reach for a referendum as the nearest available emergency cord. That strategy has always been high-risk. What if the process of elimination falters and May’s deal squeaks through after all, helped over the line by Labour votes? For the strategy to work, MPs must not only recoil from no deal, but then decide to flee to the safe harbour not of May’s Brexit deal but a public vote. A lot has to go right for all those things to happen.For that reason, I think pro-Europeans now have to make a different move. They can’t wait for the starting gun of a referendum that may or may not ever sound. Nor is it good enough to devote their energies simply to campaigning for such a vote, or to Commons manoeuvres to get one. They need instead to make the anti-Brexit case to the public right now, as if the referendum campaign had already begun. Don’t wait. Put up the posters, book the halls, spend the money right away. Do it now.The reasoning is simple. So far, pro-Europeans have emphasised the means – a second referendum – over the ends: staying in the EU. That’s the wrong way around. The first task is to persuade the public that Brexit has to be stopped: that leaving the EU will bring ruin, while staying in and making it better is the confident, open, patriotic choice. Only when voters feel that stopping Brexit on 29 March is an urgent priority will they then demand that their MPs find a way to do it, turning to a second referendum as the obvious democratic means. There is a way, but first there must be the will.“We’ve been far too up our parliamentary arses,” admits one people’s vote strategist, promising that the battle will now move to street level, with another mass demonstration on the way. He admits that they’ve paid too much attention to Westminster, which is the weather, rather than building public opposition to Brexit, which is the climate.So start the campaign now. And as pro-Europeans make their case, they need to be mindful that economic catastrophism – even the sincere warnings of medicine shortages and actual corporate decisions to relocate jobs – is not cutting through. As Gary Younge wrote on these pages last week, remain needs to tell a story that goes beyond economics and speaks to national pride.As it happens, such a narrative is there, ready to be told. It is the story of a nation that has always been plural, hybrid, forged of many tribes of a confident people who have reached across the seas to touch their closest neighbours, and who have never feared any kind of international club or alliance, because they had the confidence, even the swagger, to know they did not just belong in such a grouping, they could help shape it.Our ancestors would not recognise today’s Brexiters, so cowed and lacking in courage that they fear they can’t cut it at the top table, sitting as equals alongside France and Germany, but must hide instead in the corner, on their own. The nation whose earliest works are now on display at the British Library would see the European Union and know in an instant that its place was at the heart of it.So we do have a story to tell. But let’s not wait for May’s permission to tell it. There are fewer than 50 days to avert what will be one of the gravest errors in our long history. There is not a moment to waste."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/552eac174b9a615177499560f842749f1f2e4534/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d518ac814eac1505db92724f3f0a2997","title":"the guardian view on a twisted tale of publishing","story":"A true story worthy of a Patricia Highsmith thriller was published this week in the New Yorker. The magazine detailed the deceptions of Dan Mallory, who is the author, under the pseudonym AJ Finn, of the bestselling psychological thriller The Woman in the Window. But his launch into authordom came after a career in publishing in London and New York, during which, the investigation found, Mallory had deceived colleagues, telling them a range of stories including that his mother had died of cancer (she is alive) his brother had killed himself (he is alive) and that he himself had suffered from brain cancer. Mallory has admitted to some of this, saying that he used the excuse of brain cancer to cover up his shame at his real suffering from mental illness.One of the ironies of the New Yorker exposé, thrilling reading as it is, is that it almost cannot help but glamorise Mallory’s actions. The attractive chancer, the charming fantasist, the unscrupulous but amusing rogue: this is a stock literary character, and there are Mallorys in books by authors from Apuleius to Thackeray. Real-life rapscallions have been narrativised in similar terms – think of Frank Abagnale, a fraudster who posed as an airline pilot, who became the central character in the film Catch Me If You Can, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. (Mr Abagnale later worked for the FBI, and is now a security consultant.) Missing from Mallory’s story, by definition, are the people who could have been promoted, and should have flourished, but were blocked because of Mallory’s successful deceptions. These are his invisible victims. If things had gone better, different authors, other books, might have reached readers. Perhaps better ones.The subject of Mallory’s uncompleted postgraduate research was the novelist Patricia Highsmith. Last year, long before the recent revelations, Mallory talked to the Observer about her character Tom Ripley, who lies and deceives his way to success. Mallory said: “I think one of the reasons I was attracted to Highsmith is that most crime fiction is morally educative: morals will be upheld, justice will be doled out, wrongdoers will be caught and punished. But that did not happen with Tom Ripley and it fascinated me to see this character get away with stuff. It fascinated me more to find myself rooting for him. I still think that is a pretty nifty trick.” The Woman in the Window, the film version of Mallory’s thriller, is on its way. But the movie of Mallory’s life cannot be far behind.

Now, up to 70,000 schoolchildren each week are taking part in 270 towns and cities worldwide.Inidual protests have been held in the UK, but next week a coordinated day of action is expected to result in walkouts in more than 30 towns and cities – from Lancaster to Truro, and Ullapool to Leeds.Jake Woodier, of the UK Youth Climate Coalition, which is helping to coordinate the strikes, said Greta’s message about the need for radical, urgent change had struck a chord with hundreds of thousand of young people in the UK.“The images of what Greta did and then the huge strikes by schoolchildren in other countries have been widely shared by young people on social media and have really inspired people.”He said young people were becoming increasingly radicalised by the environmental crisis and understood the need for urgent political action.“Young people see what is happening – especially since the IPCC report last year, which spelled out that we only have 12 years left to avoid catastrophic climate change … they realise that politicians are nowhere near where they need to be on this and want to do something to change that.”There has been some pushback against the strikes by climate deniers and politicians. Last week, Belgian’s environment minister was forced to resign after falsely claiming the country’s intelligence services held evidence that the tens of thousands of children skipping school were being directed by unnamed powers.So far those planning to protest in the UK say they have had broad support.Zoe Bonnett, 14, is organising a strike in Bristol next week.“People seem to think this is an issue that can be solved another time, but there is no other time,” she said. “I know this is a drastic action, this is quite a big step that I am taking, but I do feel strongly that we have to solve it now … I have to do something. ”Bonnett, who heard about the movement after seeing a video of Greta online, said young people had a special stake in the unfolding crisis.“At the moment I am having to make my choices for GCSEs, and I realised that if there is going to be a bad future ahead those sort of choices are not really that important unless we do something urgent now.”Bonnett’s mother, Joanna, said she supported her daughter’s decision to walk out of school.“I was a bit reticent at first because I am more of a rule-keeper than a rule-breaker but as she became more enthusiastic and learned more about it and decided to set up her own strike we became very supportive.”Bonnett said she was planning to write to the headteacher of her school to outline her plan and offer to discuss the strike.The UK walkouts are being billed as a chance to build towards a global day of school strikes on 15 March.Greta has already confronted world leaders with the movement’s demand for radical climate action, first at a climate meeting in Poland in December where she accused them of acting like irresponsible children then in Davos for the World Economic Forum when she told the gathered global elite that the climate crisis was real, adding: “I want you to panic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/554596ef09db1becd7961ad47c0fa43a2dea3790/0_110_7452_4471/master/7452.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f4010ac7c4208cdbe56d4f433c81dfe","title":"week wildlife in pictures","story":"Rescued flamingo chicks, angry ibex and Californian elephant seals in this week’s gallery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8074f6d98fa3bc421ac15c6187a9d0c4f54f1530/0_118_4187_2513/master/4187.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e2d561da88040172da74e2981161a9","title":"new york fashion week shines light new talent embraces ai","story":"A futuristic Rag \u0026amp Bone show sits alongside Kate Spade’s homage to the late designerThe buzz about this New York fashion week was that there wasn’t any. With Calvin Klein sitting out the season and Rodarte the latest brand to jump ship – the designers escaped the New York winter to show in sunny Los Angeles last week – this was set to be the fashion week nobody was talking about.But the absence of marquee names has freed up the spotlight for new talent and innovative ideas. One of the hottest tickets on Friday was the first show by the little-known Tokyo-based costume designer Tomo Koizumi, to whom Marc Jacobs lent his Manhattan boutique as a venue. Invitations were issued at the last moment for the standing-only show.Meanwhile, the hackneyed fashion week tradition of filling the front row with celebrity guests is being given a fresh spin at Rag \u0026amp Bone’s event in Brooklyn, where an artificial intelligence system is to be the VIP attendee. And at Kate Spade, the Northern Irish designer Nicola Glass is bringing sunshine back to the brand that was rocked last year by the death of its eponymous founder.Noticing how the proliferation of mobile phones has drained the atmosphere from catwalk shows, Marcus Wainwright, the British co-founder of Rag \u0026amp Bone, was spurred on to stage a different kind of fashion week event. “A couple of years ago I was watching one of our shows from behind a curtain, and most of the audience were watching the show through the phones they were holding up in front of them, rather than truly watching what is in fact a live performance. I found that a bit sad. We stopped doing traditional shows after that.”Rag \u0026amp Bone’s event, A Last Supper, aims to incorporate technology into fashion week in a way that makes shows more interesting, rather than less. “Fashion week is still perfectly valid,” says Wainwright. “It still does what it was designed to do, which is operate as a marketplace for clothes. It is a congregation of the impactful people in fashion that you need to reach to run a business. We need to be here and to get across our point of view as a brand.”A Last Supper will feature a dinner party with an artificial intelligence machine physically present at the table. The dress code for the dinner, naturally, is new-season Rag \u0026amp Bone. The concept is “a nod to the way in which humans might co-exist with artificial intelligence, in the future – and to how technology is changing the way we interact with fashion,” according to Wainwright.The machine will talk and learn through the night, using code written for the occasion, before making an after-dinner speech. “It might be really weird, but I think it will be fun,” says Wainwright. “I’m not sure how deep the message is, but it should be a memorable night.” The death of Spade last June prompted a groundswell of warm feeling towards a brand with which many American women feel a connection, which has put it back in the limelight.“It’s still her name above the door,” says Glass, who took over as creative director of Kate Spade a little over a year ago, during a preview the day before her show. “This is a brand both by and about a spirited woman. I was and still am inspired by what she represented to me, and her legacy will continue to live on in the work that we do, but my job now is to make the brand feel fresh for now.”Glass is refreshing the brand by adding more nuance to the bright colours it is known for, and remodelling its jokey mood into one with a more subtle kind of wit. A “jellybean lineup” of delicious shades is a key part of the Kate Spade aesthetic, but unexpected shades such as golden raisin yellow, cherrywood, peppermint and evergreen, which Glass calls “our black”, are adding sophistication.High-waisted flared pants are a key silhouette this season. “I love wearing them. They are really flattering, actually. I’m going to wear a pair to the show,” says Glass. “This is a brand with a sense of realness. It’s for a woman who loves fashion but has a really busy life.”Some of the outfits on the catwalk will be styled with two bags, she says, “because that’s the reality of how the modern woman carries her stuff around, isn’t it?” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dd12962de2ed5faa87f6400ab153d538efce2cb/0_126_2660_1596/master/2660.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbd0b8ea6461c24b7e5efe84edbc7362","title":"albert finney an almighty physical screen presence","story":"Finney was the face of the vibrant new wave of working-class postwar British cinema, and maintained a fierce vitality in his distinguished later performances From moon-faced youth to weatherbeaten later years, Albert Finney was an almighty force on screen: a clenched fist of physicality, a battering ram of uningratiating power, almost priapic with defiant confidence, with the battle-readiness of a prop forward or sumo wrestler. His presence was very different from the long-limbed spindliness or feline charm of contemporaries such as Peter O’Toole, Tom Courtenay and Terence Stamp, those other young lions of postwar British cinema who showed that regional and working-class voices had a new, real power. And, in retirement, Salford-born Finney lived long enough to hear his name invoked as a lost hero by those enraged that, in the 21st century, working-class actors were being marginalised in Britain once again.Finney was a unique actor, although it was his fate to be compared, wonderingly, to other people. Ken Tynan famously reeled away from Finney’s Rada graduation show calling the teenager a new Spencer Tracy. Later in his theatrical career, he was dubbed a new Olivier. I would say that he was Britain’s Jean Gabin. But none of that is quite right. He was a brilliant and utterly distinctive actor, deeply rooted in a theatrical tradition but capable of naturalistic performances, a product of Britain’s vital new “kitchen-sink” cinema. And as a producer, Finney gave early breaks to Tony Scott and Stephen Frears, helped get Lindsay Anderson’s If… off the ground, and was a driving force behind Mike Leigh’s first feature, Bleak Moments.Finney made his sensational breakthrough in 1960 in Karel Reisz’s Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, playing Arthur Seaton, a tough, good-looking young womaniser working in a factory, in permanent revolt against the pomposity and hypocrisy of a society determined to keep the likes of him in their place. Finney fused lust, boredom and anger into a single emotion. Later, he was the ne’er-do-well hero in Tom Jones – John Osborne’s 1963 adaptation of the 18th-century Henry Fielding novel, also directed by Richardson – rollicking around England with many New Wave mannerisms of freezeframing and fourth-wall-breaking.It was this multi-Oscar-winning film that made Finney rich and famous, but it was atypical. His broad, open, likable face here did not feature the compressed emotion of his other roles, although the turn of his mouth had a certain sensual derision that was to become a fierce line of pain and rage in the famous performances of his later period: the doughty old lawyer in Steven Soderbergh’s Erin Brockovich (2000), playing opposite Julia Roberts and his superb turn as the agonised, careworn father of criminals in Sidney Lumet’s 2007 thriller Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead.Finney was brilliant at conveying the state of being toughly unimpressed with everything around him. Especially in his younger roles, he reminded me of Bill Atkinson, the fierce-looking lodger in Kingsley Amis’s novel Lucky Jim: “Dixon liked and revered him for his air of detesting everything that presented itself to his senses, and not meaning to let this detestation become staled by custom.”At the end of the 1960s, Finney had his single film directing credit: Charlie Bubbles, written for the screen by Shelagh Delaney. He also starred in the film, giving one of his most captivating and revealing performances as Charlie, a hugely successful writer who returns in triumph to his hometown of Salford in a Rolls Royce, looking warily discontented with what he finds in memory lane – and with himself. There is an extraordinary, dreamlike scene in which, with an American photographer (an early role for Liza Minnelli), he drives around the vast, demolished gloaming where the old Victorian back-to-backs had been pulled down, and a brass marching band turn up out of nowhere. Other scenes show Charlie in a restaurant where an old waiter poignantly remembers his father, and also show him going to Old Trafford for a Manchester United match.Charlie Bubbles depicts how Britain was changing and what sudden, dizzying 60s-style success really felt like for Finney (and Delaney). And the scenes showing Charlie rowing with his ex-wife (Billie Whitelaw) are weirdly like in Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. In the old days, a bloke might be off gallivanting down the pub now he’s off gallivanting in London with his fancy showbusiness friends. The sexual politics are the same. There is incidentally a bizarre scene in which Charlie and an old pal (Colin Blakely) amiably slosh food over each other in a posh London restaurant. It is far more interesting than the (overrated) sexy-eating scene in Tom Jones.Finney’s screen career continued into the 70s, though without the zeitgeist thrill of the earlier decade. His most successful role of this decade was probably Hercule Poirot in Sidney Lumet’s all-star hit version of the Agatha Christie mystery Murder on the Orient Express (1975), which taught the film and television worlds what a very reliable moneyspinner Agatha Christie could be. Finney made Poirot a gimlet-eyed, severe, martinet figure, rather different from the more musing and cerebral Poirots of David Suchet and Kenneth Branagh.One of my favourite Finney performances comes from the beginning of the next decade: the once raved-over but now underappreciated Shoot the Moon (1982), directed by Alan Parker and scripted by veteran dramatist and screenwriter Bo Goldman. It is a post-Bergman marital-anguish drama of the sort that hasn’t been fashionable for many a day. Finney plays George, a colossally successful writer, semi-openly having an affair, a fact that causes torment to his wife, Faith (Diane Keaton), and their four children. Emotional meltdown ensues. It has such a virile and vehement turn from Finney: his face is creased with agony, self-loathing and an awful kind of self-control that presages a yet larger explosion, which is to come with the film’s famous firework-display of destructive rage over a new tennis court.One of Finney’s great later performances is his glorious leading turn – and distinctively comic one, in a career not noted for comedy – in The Dresser (1983). This was adapted by Ronald Harwood from his stage play, which was based on his own experiences as a long-suffering personal assistant, or “dresser”, to the renowned Shakespearean actor Sir Donald Wolfit. Finney plays the imperious, mercurial and slightly mad “Sir”, as he leads a threadbare rep company around wartime Britain, and Tom Courtenay plays the camp dresser, the only man who can chivvy, bully and wheedle Sir into his costume, and out of whatever crazy or despondent mood he is in, in time for curtain up. Finney and Courtenay might easily have swapped roles for the film, though I think it was well cast this way around.The outrageously funny and hammy performances by Sir as Othello or Lear – all booming, screeching and whooping vowels – are supposed to show us what an old-fashioned and obsolete acting style that is. But perhaps it was not so far from the continuing Shakespearean tradition in which Finney appeared, night after night, because his stage career carried on alongside his screen work. Unlike Olivier, Finney never committed Shakespearean roles to the screen. Yet The Dresser, however cartoonish, gives us an interesting insight into Finney’s own classical acting persona. Perhaps the off-stage Sir in his dressing room – florid, verbose, panicky but often witty and relaxed – is a hint of the onstage Finney of that time. And maybe Sir is someone whom Finney did not himself despise. This quixotic old-stager performance is not far from his excellent interpretation of Winston Churchill in the 2002 TV movie The Gathering Storm.An awful lot of flavour and texture has left British acting with the departure of Albert Finney."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud.

The novice full-back who had confronted and contained Christian Eriksen, Alexis Sánchez and Eden Hazard on his first three senior outings and has established himself as the most prolific and cleanest tackler across Europe’s elite five leagues, was backstage at his old school, Good Shepherd, when his name was announced inside the assembly hall.The boy from New Addington turned Crystal Palace full-back had anticipated an audience with a couple of classes at most, so the ear-splitting din summoned by the excitable throng, 250-strong, rocked him on his heels. There was a flicker of apprehension, a sheepish smile as he edged into the hall, and disbelief at the delighted bedlam. “It’s mad to see,” he offered once the Q\u0026ampA and quiz had been successfully negotiated. “A lot of the time I can’t really get my head around it, but it shows I’ve come a long way. I have to be grateful.”Wan-Bissaka is slowly coming to terms with the adulation, even if trips back to this corner of Croydon tend to labour the point. His parents still live round the corner from the school, across from the sloped field where he first ventured out with his older brother, Kevin, for a kickabout. “There’d be balls flying everywhere, a free for all. The council would cut the grass every now and then and we’d play proper 15-a-side matches, and I’d be first pick, even though I was probably the youngest. It was the skills. The free-styling. I loved watching Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho expressing themselves, so that’s what I copied.”These days the kids tend to spot his car on his visits home, before camping outside the Wan-Bissakas’ house, taking turns to ring the doorbell and pester for an autograph. Up at the community centre in nearby Fieldway, where the Palace for Life Foundation teams up with Croydon council and the politan Police to run coaching courses aimed at tackling youth violence, he is the poster boy. Those in attendance at Good Shepherd included a local publican seeking a signature on a pair of boots, and Father Boyle, brandishing the player’s baptism certificate, from the neighbouring church. Wan-Bissaka is the local lad, from one of the borough’s poorest wards, made spectacularly good.Most remarkable is the ease with which he has taken to the Premier League. At 14 there had been a debate at Palace as to whether Wan-Bissaka, a quiet, gangly kid, should be retained. By early 2017 the boyhood Arsenal supporter was still essentially striving to make his mark at a club brimming with wingers. Twelve months ago, as an unused fourth-choice right-back, he had pushed for a move to League Two. On Saturday he confronts West Ham as the best one-on-one defender in the ision this season having mustered more successful tackles (66 of 91) than anyone in the Premier League, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue Un or Primera Liga.He is the only player in England to boast 40 or more tackles, completed take-ons (40) and interceptions (57), and only seven opponents have successfully wriggled beyond him. And all this from a player – his nickname is “Spider” – who has never received any formal coaching on how to tackle. “No, none. Never. I have no idea where I get it from, and I’m just as confused when I see all the stats. I’d never tackle on Walton Green. I was too busy doing the tricks, and I just didn’t like defending. I’d intercept the ball because I was quick, but I only probably started tackling in the under-23s.The then first-team coach, Kevin Keen, had hauled him from the academy to make up the numbers and was impressed with the way he succeeded in nullifying Wilfried Zaha. Yet it was the under-23 coaches, Richard Shaw and Dave Reddington, who took the plunge by employing the tearaway winger at right-back in a 2-2 draw at Charlton. The rookie was exposed at times.“I really didn’t enjoy it,” said Wan-Bissaka. “I couldn’t express myself going forward, the defending was all new, and I came away thinking: ‘This isn’t me.’ I never said anything, but Redders and Shawsy knew. They started working with me, doing second sessions, practising defensive drills. That’s when it started.“Training up against Wilf and Yannick Bolasie toughened me up. When I was younger my playing style was like Wilf’s, so that sort of gave me a heads-up, but he’s still a tricky one. As an ex-winger, you get a sense of what they’re trying to do: which way they might go, how they’re thinking. You can anticipate things easier. When Roy Hodgson changed my timetable to full-time with the first team, I knew I was making progress even if I still never played.It would take an injury crisis four weeks later to offer an opportunity to become the first academy graduate to make his debut for the senior side for 2,148 days. “On the day before the game with Tottenham Hotspur I’d counted up there were 19 of us training, including two other under‑23s, so I was sure I’d make the bench. We all piled into the analysis meeting where they put the lineup up on the whiteboard. I’d always scan the bench first, at the bottom, because I’m realistic. But I wasn’t on it. I was gutted. I don’t know who tapped me on the shoulder first, but that made me look at the top of the list and there I was, second down, at right-back.“Spurs, Christian Eriksen ... the first thing that went through my mind was it was going to be a long afternoon. But the manager clearly had faith in me. My aim has always been to make him proud because he gave me a chance. I went to bed earlier than usual that night, and was buzzing until I got to the ground on match day. Then, 10 minutes before kick-off, the nerves kicked in until the first tackle. It was on Ben Davies. He cut in-field away from me and kept running, but I don’t think he knew I had such long legs. I chased him down, slid in and took the ball to set up a counter. I wasn’t shy. I never looked back from that.”Wan-Bissaka’s form has been a revelation to such an extent that, when he gave the ball away at the end of last weekend’s victory over Fulham, Hodgson admitted to being “relieved because I was starting to think he might be a robot”. Nothing has fazed Wan-Bissaka, other than possibly the plaudits. He has the episodes of Match of the Day when Alan Shearer gushed over his performance Sky-plussed back home.Gareth Southgate has taken notice before next month’s Euro 2020 qualifiers. Wan-Bissaka once played up front for DR Congo’s Under-17s in a friendly at St George’s Park, but has since represented England to Under‑21 level and the Football Association, having lost Victor Moses and Zaha to Nigeria and Ivory Coast, will be anxious not to let another prospect nurtured in south London slip away. “Yannick spoke to me about Congo, and it was an option, but my parents said they’d support me either way. As a kid, playing for my country was a dream. It would be such a huge honour.”First, though, Wan-Bissaka has progress at Palace to occupy his mind. The pupils at Good Shepherd, with whom Palace for Life hopes to work as it extends the project which has seen coaches placed in 35 primary schools, had mobbed their hero at the end of the assembly, the full-back swamped by a pile of adoring fans. Typically, he emerged unscathed: utterly unflappable after all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c02e6e9d461d0d6fee91f86b3d2b36fb4e5e4fd/70_0_3361_2017/master/3361.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52e99ed393b49a1d66dc3cbbd720e6c9","title":"liverpool feeling pressure premier league title race manchester city","story":"Five of the club’s former players address the key question after Jürgen Klopp’s side surrender top spot to Manchester CityI think it’s nonsense, I really do.

Mo Salah carries his country on his own shoulders. I think you’d probably find more pressure on a scouser because of the history of the club but the front three are from different parts of the world.When you have a history as long and varied as Liverpool you’re going to get this. Liverpool will be scrutinised more than Tottenham. Man United will be scrutinised more than another opponent because of their marvellous history. Until Liverpool win something it will continue. Everybody knows that. The manager knows it and all the players probably know it. They need to get over the line somewhere don’t they?You don’t think about pressure. I certainly didn’t. When I look back on my career, I think: ‘Wow, I was the goalscorer for Liverpool and England, playing in World Cups and FA Cup finals.’ The prime minister is probably under most pressure but after that, there is not much more pressure than being a top player at a top club going for the title or in a final. Half the bloody world are watching. When you look back then of course there is pressure, and there is pressure from the outside looking in, but not when you are playing. This is what you do, this is what you are brilliant at.If you look at all the great sportsmen, Tiger Woods with a six-footer on the last green, you know they are enjoying it and are thriving on the pressure. That is their life. It’s not a choice and it is not just happening for a day. They live like this. It works the other way round, too. When you retire and you don’t have that pressure any more you can go a bit doolally, because you almost feel you have no purpose in life any more. That was what everything was about when you were a player. They won’t be feeling pressure or losing any sleep.One of the West Ham players said Liverpool were showing a few nerves on Monday. Liverpool’s record over the last 10 games is better than Manchester City’s, so who is feeling the pressure? This team has been at the top very early and, in my day, we used to make a surge around Easter. We built up a head of steam then. I think today’s players have a good attitude. Maybe we haven’t done as well in the last couple of games but Bournemouth is the next game now. Win that. Don’t look too far ahead. If Liverpool win every game they win the league. That is what their mindset should be.Robbie Fowler, Liverpool 1993-2001 and 2006-07I really don’t get what people are talking about. Liverpool are level on points at the top of the league with a game in hand. You would have taken this all day long at the start of the season. There are loads of positives. Of course there is pressure but there is pressure on players from the first game of the season. When you want to win the league and you haven’t won it before, it might be a different pressure but pressure is always there. The lads at Manchester City know they are under pressure to deliver, too. The pressure isn’t different on Tottenham and Manchester City compared to Liverpool. It will be there all the way until the end of the season.

It’s good to face them and move onIt is coming up to two years since my boyfriend of four and a half years broke up with me. I had been having doubts about the relationship, but when he called it off I was overwhelmed by the rejection and spent the rest of the year heartbroken, forgetting the relationship wasn’t perfect. I moved to a new city shortly afterwards and have spent the past couple of years working on myself, my hobbies and personal relationships, and am in a happy space.I am going to a wedding in four months’ time, and he and his new girlfriend will be there. Over the past few months I’ve had a recurring dream that on meeting her, I am disgustingly crude and rude to her. I say the most appallingly bitchy things to my friends (who are also friends of my ex) in order to make me feel better, but it only makes me look undignified. I hate the person I become in this dream, but the feelings of hatred I have towards this woman boil up inside me and even as I type this email, I feel a burning blackness in my heart. It is completely irrational.I want to handle myself with class. I want to get over it, but these dreams stir up my feelings. I’m at a loss now, as time is not proving to be the healer it should be.In your longer letter you also told me all about the great things you are doing: working full-time, studying for a master’s part-time, making new friends, being healthy. You say you are in a good place, and happy. All of which is excellent.But there was a line in your letter which gave me a clue to your malaise and it was that your friends are mutual friends with your ex. So I wonder if you’ve been able, in real life, to really let rip and vent about the relationship, in the way people do when they split up.Dreams can be horrible but they are not premonitions, nor do they mean you are a bad person. It’s what you do that matters, not what you think. We all need a place to let out our darkest side and, for most people, that stays in their head – as it should.I consulted psychotherapist Chris Mills, who specialises in relationships. “You’re worried and confused because different parts of you seem at odds and are moving at different speeds. They seem in opposition but, actually, they are working together. The problem is that you’re much more comfortable with the rational, measured, forward-looking part of yourself than the primitive, vengeful, ferocious part.”I wondered if you have had problems expressing anger: how did people react when you got angry as a child? Were you helped to work through these feelings, or did you learn to bottle them up? I think you need to look at this. It’s OK to be angry: sometimes appropriate anger is a great facilitator.“As you say yourself,” Mills pointed out, “‘I became angry but it helped me to… move on’. It’s the rational part of you that was able to see the relationship was less than perfect. It’s the rational part of you that is allowing you to plan and strategise and give you the busy, fulfilling life you have now. But being angrily reactive is another part of who you are. We take enormous risks in the attachments we make and when we lose them – even if we choose to break up with someone ourselves – we can feel deep disturbance and panic.”Don’t be afraid of the part of you that is having these negative feelings. It’s easy to blot them out and try to bury them. I used to, but then one day I decided to turn round and face them to find out what they were telling me and how I really felt. It’s a bit uncomfortable for a while, but it diffuses things. I asked Mills why you might be having this dream. He said that if we try to quash feelings repeatedly, our subconscious has a way of bringing them back to our attention.So this wedding invitation has brought to the fore feelings you have buried. That’s good. Face them, absorb them as part of who you are. You don’t have to go to the wedding, of course, but I hope you do. Mills and I both agreed this seemed like a massive bottleneck of emotions and although Mills said you “might feel a bit down after the wedding”, he also feels that something will have cleared.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

Sitting on the couch, I’m snuggled up with a blanket, with the fire roaring and a cup of hot chocolate by my side.It might sound like the perfect recipe to induce a good night’s sleep for me – but that’s not my aim. In fact, I’m working. Perched on my knee is a laptop and I’m writing my latest bedtime story, one that I hope will send millions of sleep-starved grownups into a soothing and relaxing night’s slumber.I should know: I’m sleep storyteller-in-residence for Calm, a sleep aid and meditation app that hosts more than 16 of my travel tales narrated by Stephen Fry and Joanna Lumley, to name but two. My stories, along with the others on the app, have been listened to 100 million times since they were launched in December 2016, and regularly attract more than 9m listens a month.Each one is written in such a way that the listener should never make it to the end. They are full of descriptive prose and, crucially for my stories, a journey that’s interesting enough to capture the imagination and make someone want to hear it, yet soothing enough to make them nod off.The idea harks back to when we were kids and an adult would read to us to make us fall asleep It’s an old-fashioned, but tried and tested method that, for some reason, we gave up.“There’s a paradox to sleep, in that it comes when you’re not trying,” says Dr Steve Orma, a clinical psychologist in San Francisco who specialises in treating people with insomnia. “When you try to sleep, your mind monitors your efforts, which then keeps you awake.“So, doing something calming before bed – like listening to a sleep story – that’s designed to help you let go, will prepare you for sleep.”So, by captivating you with my tale, it’s preventing you worrying about actually going to sleep, which, paradoxically, then sends you straight to the land of nod in – going by the emails I regularly get from listeners – about five-to-10 minutes.But it doesn’t have to just be a descriptive travel tale to help you forget about your worries and drift off to sleep. A friend directed me to a popular podcast called Sleep With Me, which has an altogether different approach.Rather than a focused story, the host, Drew Ackerman, instead helps more than 3.3m listeners fall asleep each month by talking about all manner of things – from episodes of Star Trek and Doctor Who to rambling, and often bizarre, stories about made-up characters based on Twitter trends – which often go off on tangents.“I offer an alternative narrative to the one that might be running in the listener’s mind,” explains Ackerman. “They might already be telling themselves a story, about their day at work, getting their taxes done, the chronic pain they are experiencing or about some traumatic event that impacted them. A bedtime story, where ideally there are no personal stakes, can shift their thoughts or disengage the gears, just enough to drift off to sleep.”And, it seems for some, words themselves aren’t even necessary. Sound and in particular music alone is distraction enough. John Powell, the author of Why We Love Music, says he believes tunes are even more effective.“The human body contains an internal ‘pharmacy’ which dispenses chemicals to help us deal with various situations effectively, including adrenaline and cortisol which energise us in scary “fight or flight” situations, and norepinephrine, which enhances vigilance,” he says. “Soothing music reduces the amount of sleep-depriving stress hormones in your system and helps you drift off to sleep.”Ultimately sleep is important – to both our physical and our mental health – and with insomnia on the increase, whether you opt to nod off by listening to music, a meandering mumble on Sleep With Me or one of my own sleep stories on the Calm app, knowing that I can potentially be part of the solution allows me to sleep that little bit sounder too.1.

I come for those (who doesn’t like a pie?) but also the valley’s no-nonsense towns, carved from gruff stone, and My Perfect Countryside, pinched between Pendle Hill and the Forest of Bowland, splicing lush green river banks of fat cows and the more savage kind of moorland. All those plus a splodge of nostalgia.This neck of the woods is where my mum was from.

An edition of the work featured in Tate Modern’s Hirst retrospective in 2012.Trustees of Michael’s estate said all the money raised would go to good causes. “Philanthropic work was hugely important for George during his lifetime and it was his wish that this work would continue after his passing,” they said in a statement.Cristian Albu, of Christie’s, said the auction house was honoured to be handling the sale. He called the collection “a portrait of Britain in the 1990s”.Albu said Michael’s introduction to Emin was a pivotal moment. “She introduced him to the entire YBA community, he met the whole Goldsmiths’ gang and this is how the idea of collecting started. They were a family, everybody cared about everybody.”Michael often chose works because of their title, said Albu. Hirst’s The Incomplete Truth could be one of Michael’s songs or an Emin embroidered blanket, Drunk to the bottom of my soul, which is being sold with an estimate of £180,000-£250,000.Another work in the collection, a particular favourite that Michael hung in his bedroom, is Songbird by Bridget Riley, an oil-on-linen painting from 1982 that is being sold with an estimate of £400,000-£600,000.“He bought works which resonated with him,” said Albu. “People like Tracey Emin, they were rebels and he felt a bit of himself in these artists.”Craig-Martin taught many of the YBAs at Goldsmiths and is considered something of a guru to them. Michael was a fan and commissioned Craig-Martin to create portraits of him and his partner Kenny Goss for which the artist used software to continually change colours and mood. So for a moment Michael might be smiling with with peach hair, bluish face and lavender goatee, the next moment he won’t.It is being sold with an estimate of £40,000-£60,000.Michael became famous with Andrew Ridgeley in Wham! in the 1980s and went on to sell more than 100m albums as a solo artist. He died as a result of heart and liver disease on Christmas Day 2016, aged 53.It emerged after his death how much good work he had done, such as giving millions to Childline – including the future royalties to Jesus to a Child – and working anonymously at a homeless shelter.Christie’s said key works in the collection would go on tour to New York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong and Shanghai before the main sale on 14 March. There will be an online sale of the lower-value works from 8-15 March.Jussi Pylkkänen, Christie’s president, said: “George Michael was a much-admired creative genius of the music industry and the viewing of over 200 works of art from the private collection will provide a fascinating insight into the broader tastes of a man who was deeply admired all over the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eac501bcf0eb1f3674189a913d1268d934268858/0_45_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53639ba0ff7cf6a42f1d56d1a83da45a","title":"the specials reach no 1 in album charts for first time with encore","story":"Band’s latest release is their first album of new material in 37 yearsThe Specials have climbed to the top of the charts with their first album of new material in 37 years.The latest release from the band – who are pioneers of the ska scene in the UK – has made it to No 1 in the album charts.Encore is their first No 1 album, and it is the first time they have topped the charts since their classic track Ghost Town in 1981, and 39 years since their single Too Much Too Young became a No 1.The band was formed in 1977 in Coventry and has undergone numerous changes since then, including being renamed Special AKA in the early 1980s.Quoted by the Official Charts Company, the Specials said: “Recording the album has been one of the most amazing trips of our lives.“What can we say? It couldn’t have been better timing. A real thanks to the fans who have stayed with us for all this time. We all share in this, thank you.”The band made a name with their ska and rocksteady style, and for providing a musical backdrop to economic recession, urban decay and societal fracture in the early 1980s.After a week of intense promotion and signings with Specials fans, they have narrowly beaten their chart competition to top spot, by just over 1,000 sales.Miranda Sawyer, who interviewed the band for the Observer on Sunday, described the new album in her article as “strong musically, with an unexpectedly broader palette that takes in disco, funk and oompah as well as reggae.”She also said that the lyrics “take on the personal and the political, the US and the UK, though more ambiguously than the Specials’ original precision attacks.”According to the Official Charts Company, Busted’s latest album Half Way There came second in a week of resurgent bands.The Greatest Showman cast recording remains in the album charts at No 3, having spent 28 non-consecutive weeks at the top since its release, with another veteran performer Ian Brown making it to No 4 with Ripples.London Rapper Fredo’s release Third Avenue came fifth in the album charts. Ariana Grande remains at the top of the singles chart for the third week in a row with 7 Rings. Ava Max is at No 2 with Sweet But Pyscho.Sam Smith and Normani’s Dancing With a Stranger is No 3, and Calvin Harris and Rag’n’Bone Man claimed No 4 with Giant.

But sources close to the group, led by the Tory MP Nick Boles and Labour’s Yvette Cooper, said it seemed likely that the prime minister would be given more time to discuss a Labour Brexit proposal and hold more talks with Brussels.“The Tory MPs are keen to give the PM a chance to follow up on the cross-party talks, and negotiations with the EU,” the source said. A bill laying out how MPs could seek to avoid a no-deal departure may nonetheless be published next week, they said.“There’s a definite sense that lots of Tories are worried about no deal, but they don’t want to look like they are trying to obstruct her negotiations,” the source said. “There is very definitely a majority in parliament against no deal, but it’s a question of how to proceed and when.”The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, who supported the last Cooper-Boles amendment, told the : “Our position is that the ball is in the PM’s court. What we do depends on what the PM does.”Any further delay would be contingent on May promising a future date for either a vote on her deal or another amendable motion, he said, adding: “Parliament has to have its say.”It sets the scene for an increasingly tense couple of weeks in which May will attempt to stitch together a Brexit plan that can get a parliamentary majority while the EU and backbenchers watch the clock tick down towards 29 March.After a bruising set of talks in Brussels on Thursday in which the European council president, Donald Tusk, mentioned Jeremy Corbyn’s proposals as a way of breaking the impasse, May was to meet the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, for a dinner in Dublin on Friday.The talks were intended to build on discussions May had in Northern Ireland and Brussels this week, her spokeswoman said. “She’ll be emphasising what we are looking for: seeking the legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement that parliament said it needs to approve the deal.”Earlier on Friday the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, met his Irish counterpart, Séamus Woulfe, for talks on the backstop, the insurance policy intended to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland if no permanent agreement can be reached.May and Cox are pushing for changes to the backstop such as a time limit or a unilateral exit mechanism for the UK, a key demand of the DUP and many Conservative backbenchers, but the chances of any progress seem slight.Speaking earlier in Belfast, where he met Northern Irish parties, Varadkar said that while the meal with May was an opportunity to “share perspectives” on Brexit, actual negotiations “can only be between the European Union and the United Kingdom”.“There is much more that unites us than ides us and time is running short, and we need to get to an agreement really as soon as possible,” he said.In an interview shown on RTE, the Irish state broadcaster, on Friday night, Varadkar said he thought a deal could be done, but he was unsure if it would happen before the UK leaves the EU. “I think that on balance we will secure a deal – whether it will be by the end of March or after an extension, I can’t say,” he said.May has yet to formally respond to Corbyn’s letter on Wednesday in which he said Labour would support her Brexit deal if she makes five legally binding commitments, including joining a customs union.The Labour leader faces disquiet from some of his MPs over the move, which some have interpreted as a shift away from the possibility of pushing for a second referendum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f598977efaaace4efd9504e0d75cad905cda0da/0_0_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ff2c27d024a09a4444be58c520be058","title":"japan seeking big concessions from britain in trade talks eu brexit","story":"Lack of clarity about UK-EU trading relationship after Brexit also holding up progress Japan is seeking tougher concessions from Britain in trade talks than it secured from the EU, while negotiations between London and Tokyo are also being slowed by the looming risk of no-deal Brexit.Japanese trade negotiators are confident they can extract better terms, the Financial Times reported, in a sign of the mounting difficulties facing UK officials as they attempt to line up post-Brexit trade deals around the world.Japan and the EU began trading under a new free trade agreement this month, an arrangement that will be unavailable to the UK after Brexit. While officials from the UK and Japan are seeking to agree a bilateral deal, it will not be in place before 29 March when Britain is scheduled to leave the EU. The UK’s trade with Japan will also revert to World Trade Organization tariffs in the case of a no-deal Brexit.The Department for International Trade (DIT) told business leaders this week that time was running out for Britain to roll-over trade deals with about 60 countries the EU has free trade arrangements with, which the UK benefits from until it leaves the bloc. Barring a handful of small and medium-sized countries, including Chile and the Faroe Islands, the majority of deals are expected to miss the deadline.One attendee at the meeting said the lack of clarity about the UK’s trading relationship with the EU after Brexit had held up progress, and that the Japan-EU deal included a “most-favoured nation” clause that meant Tokyo could not offer anything better on trade in services to Britain than it had given to the EU.Other countries unlikely to agree deals before 29 March include major UK trading partners such as Turkey, South Korea and Canada, they said.Japan is a significant market for the UK as it is among the largest trading partners for Britain outside the EU. Britain has a trade surplus with Japan, exporting about £12.5bn in goods and services a year while importing about £11.5bn.The DIT has been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/510339c3cebc69fd77bf9d5586f2a6917de7a834/88_226_3100_1860/master/3100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=585c46b87e47b186ce5cecb413cd8150","title":"second referendum necessary if no brexit agreement says john mcdonnell politics live","story":"Group has been recognised by the Electoral Commission and plans to field candidates across UKThanks for following the blog today and for all your comments. Have a good weekend. Here’s a summary of the afternoon’s main events:The controversial vote of no confidence against Luciana Berger, who has criticised Jeremy Corbyn over antisemitism and been linked with leaving the party has been dropped my colleague Jessica Elgot says.In an interview with Talk Radio last month, Catherine Blaiklock, the leader of the new Brexit party said it wanted a no-deal Brexit although she rejected that expression, describing it as just being “a normal country, just an independent nation”.She said she’d been called racist “even though I’ve got a Jamaican husband, and two half, half, you know mixed race children”.A new Brexit party, supported by Nigel Farage has been officially recognised by the Electoral Commission and is likely to win over thousands of Tory defectors, the  reports. The party is called ...The Brexit Party. It says it will field candidates in England, Wales, Scotland and Europe.The party leader is former Ukip candidate, Catherine Blaiklock, who the New European profiled her last month (it’s worth reading in full): She is best-known for failing to win Great Yarmouth for UKIP in the 2017 general election despite an innovative campaign which saw her brandish a large photograph of her Jamaican husband at one hustings in an attempt to demonstrate that ’Kippers were not racist, later telling Vice “I sleep with somebody who is black.”Her recent return to the limelight has provided equally startling quotes, with Blaiklock telling the Sun that “people feel treason has been committed” in the fight against Brexit ...Blaiklock advised those on low income to heed the example of Sherpas in the Himalayas, who eat “practically nothing but boiled potatoes with a bit of salt and chilli on the side”.Farage, the former Ukip leader who is supporting the party, said “the engine is running” and he stood “ready for battle” to fight the Tories and Labour of the European Parliament elections are held.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has joined the criticism of Tory MP Chris Chope for blocking the FGM bill (see 3.18pm). Labour has called for him to have the Tory whip withdrawn:Japan and South Korea, like the US - see 11.22am post - are hoping to extract better trade terms from the UK post-Brexit according to the FT and its chief political correspondent.A Tory MP who blocked a bill on upskirting has now done the same for one which would have allowed courts to issue protection orders if they thought a child was at risk of FGM.Chope has form for delaying bills by shouting “object” during their second reading in the Commons, meaning they can not be put through to the next stage without debate and a vote. After the upskirting bill controversy, he claimed he backed the intent of the bill but objected to it because he does not support the principle of legislation being passed without debate at second reading. It is an explanation Zac Goldsmith, who sponsored the FGM bill, is scornful of.The former shadow chancellor, Chris Leslie, has hinted he could quit the party over dissatisfaction with its Brexit policy.Amid reports that “at least” six Labour MPs are preparing to resign the whip and form a centre group, Leslie said it was “absolutely understandable” that some of his colleagues may feel they have been driven to the edge. I have to be honest, my patience is wearing pretty thin with the Labour Party policy on Brexit.This is the big issue of the moment and it’s going to affect not just trading relationships but percolate right through to the revenues that we have for our public services. If I want to avoid another decade of austerity I can’t help but focus on what is happening on Brexit and what is the Labour Party’s policy on Brexit and that is why... I’ve got some serious worries about where the leadership are going having basically dropped all of that Labour Party conference policy commitment from September and apparently trying to airbrush the concept of a public vote, letting the public have the final say on this, from where we stand. Asked how close he is to leaving the party, Leslie said: Like a lot of people, party members who are resigning or thinking of giving up, do I understand that they are being driven to the edge? I do understand that, I think that is absolutely understandable. And I think the Labour leadership have absolutely got to address this right now. The former taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, has suggested that a border poll on a united Ireland could happen as a result of Brexit. He told the BBC:I wouldn’t say inevitable, but I do think you will see a border poll. I do think if the UK, which seems almost positive now, pull out of the EU, the issue then will not just be about whether there should be a united Ireland, people will also be reflecting do Northern Ireland want to be in the European Union or not?Now, Scotland might have a similar position in years to come. But I do see that being a factor that people who want to be in Europe will say a united Ireland is more attractive.Speaking in the Commons, Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson has condemned the no-confidence motion proposed by Luciana Berger’s constituency party against the MP as disgraceful.The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has insisted his dinner with the prime minister will not involve any negotiation on the terms of the Brexit deal.It’s an opportunity for us to meet again to share perspectives on Brexit but, of course, not to engage in negotiations, as they can only be between the European Union and the United Kingdom.Varadkar, speaking in Belfast ahead of meetings with the five Stormont parties, before travelling back to Dublin to host Theresa May at Farmleigh House, said:I think everybody wants to avoid no deal, everybody wants to avoid a hard border and everybody wants to continue to have a very close political and economic relationship between Britain and Ireland no matter want happens. There is much more that unites us than ides us and time is running short and we need to get to an agreement really as soon as possible, and I’ll be working very hard and redoubling my efforts, along with government, to do that.The EU chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has offered niceties but no real grounds for hope to the Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, ahead of their meeting on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4acd8b07d3e738b62f3b5b319bae2589c0e0c85b/0_288_5173_3104/master/5173.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3db0c2556dcf1bad0694b9c3a02d9709","title":"johanna konta great britain fed cup hungary playoff","story":"• Konta beat Anna Bondar, Katie Boulter also wins in three• Great Britain to play Serbia in Saturday’s play-offJohanna Konta kept her nerve to subdue Anna Bondar of Hungary, ranked 224 in the world, in three sets and take Great Britain into Saturday’s Fed Cup play-off against Serbia.Konta, Britain’s No 1, won 6-2, 6-7 (1), 7-6 (4) to give the home side a winning 2-0 lead after Katie Boulter’s three-set defeat of Dalma Galfi in the opening singles at the University of Bath.The winners of Saturday’s play-off in the Fed Cup EuropeAfrica Zone Group 1 will win a place in the World Group II play-off in April.Konta, ranked 39 in the world, was pushed all the way by Bondar before claiming victory on her first match point.“I am very fortunate to have come through that,” Konta said. “I think it was my experience which got me through.

Ian Russell believes Instagram was partly to blame.All graphic images of self-harm will be banned on Instagram and algorithmic boosts given to non-graphic related content heavily stifled, Mosseri said.He also promised to do more to actively help to users with mental health problems, saying the app was “focused on getting more resources to people posting and searching for self-harm related content and directing them to organisations that can help”.He also promised to consult experts about other possibilities, such as “blurring any non-graphic self-harm related content with a sensitivity screen, so that images are not immediately visible”.For a sense of the panic inside its parent company Facebook this week, consider the fact that the last promise directly overrules Mosseri’s attempts to control the crisis just a few days earlier.On Monday, he said: “Starting this week we will be applying sensitivity screens to all content we review that contains cutting.” By Thursday, that had become a total block on the content, and a suggestion to roll out the sensitivity screens even to material “such as healed scars”.Thursday’s announcement led to confusion among many people who may have wondered why Instagram had allowed graphic images of self-harm on the platform in the first place. Mosseri had provided just such an explanation on Monday: “We still allow people to share that they are struggling,” he said, explaining why the content would be allowed to stay, albeit blurred.The last-minute tightening of company’s policies will increase the burden on Instagram’s moderation staff. Some of the work would have been done anyway, since flagging an image as “graphic self-harm” is the same amount of work whether it is then blurred or simply taken down.But the company now has to tackle a very difficult challenge, to find and take down “non-graphic, self-harm related content”. Not only is that likely to be far more common than graphic content, it was previously unmoderated.Harder still, Instagram will now need to define what exactly that phrase means – and do so in a way simple enough that its moderators can decide whether or not to act on images with just a few seconds to think about each one.If “healed scars” are to be removed from search, hashtags and the explore tab, for instance, does that mean someone with scarred arms will never be able to post a selfie of themselves wearing a T-shirt?The company will be helped by Facebook’s own investment in image recognition technology, said Jake Moore of the cybersecurity firm ESET. “As image recognition software becomes more finely tuned, the process of removing becomes more slick. Sometimes it feels that these social media platforms forget how impactful these feeds are on people, especially to those most vulnerable, so any help towards omitting such material is a good thing.“The more people report such images to the platform, the better the algorithm becomes in recognising such images and becomes quicker in removing them. It is therefore a joint effort from both Instagram and its users to remove self-harm images, which will take time.”In the short term, however, Instagram appears to have achieved its main goal: head off tighter regulations. Faced with a government eager to secure a visible win, yet perilously short on legislative time to force through regulations, it looks like ministers are already preparing to champion Instagram’s about-turn as a success.Margot James, the digital minister, said the government would “have to keep the situation very closely under review to make sure that these commitments are made real – and as swiftly as possible”. But it’s in neither Instagram’s, nor the government’s, interest to see this bubble back up again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps. We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

Young readers reveal why they adore it – from the sarcasm to the timeless love stories ... and Fat MonicaA new survey into teenage media habits done by Childwise shows that the New York-based comedy is the favourite TV show of viewers aged five to 16 in the UK. It’s a remarkable statistic, given that the majority of those surveyed would not even have been born when the series ended in 2004. We asked you to tell us why you love Friends. Here’s what some of you said:It gives us all hope that everything will work out. In real life, friendships don’t happen like they do in Friends and neither do relationships, but I think everyone who watches it wishes they did. I also think people love the idea of always having someone to talk to and share things with.My favourite character is Chandler. I think he is underplayed: many people like Joey and Phoebe because they are seen to get all the best lines, but Chandler has a different type of humour – one that I appreciate! His relationship with Monica is perfect, too, and they balance each other out.My favourite episode has to be The One with Five Steaks and an Eggplant. It’s a bit of an odd choice as the gang are at ends with each other, but I love how they do everything they can to work things out. This is really rare nowadays, when a tiny disagreement can end friendships. Molly, 15, HertfordshireI watch Friends almost every day and when I finish the 10th season I rewatch it. I find out a lot of things about life from the show. I like being treated like an adult when I hear people talking about it and I can join in. I have only been allowed to watch it since May as I’m nearly 12.I don’t have a favourite character – I have a list. My top favourite is Fat Monica. Second is Rachel and third is Chandler. Chandler is funny because he’s sarcastic and I like sarcasm.I like all the flashback episodes, but my favourite is where Rachel and Monica watch the Thanksgiving tape and see Ross about to take Rachel to prom. Leah, 11, EnfieldFriends is relatable to nearly every person, as well as being funny. It involves scenarios people my age are starting to go through, but instead of taking them seriously, it manages to make a joke of every single one. It’s based on everyday lives, and most people can relate to one of the characters. My favourite character? That’s a tough one. I’d have to go with Phoebe, because of how she deals with everything that comes her way. She gets herself into situations that are just hilarious.There are too many good episodes to choose from, however one of the best would be The One with Chandler and Monica’s Wedding: Part 2, when Rachel’s pregnancy is revealed to Monica and Phoebe. When Phoebe finds the pregnancy test she assumes it is Monica’s. When Phoebe realises that it is in fact Rachel’s, instead of revealing it, she says she is the one who is pregnant with James Brolin’s child and that she needs to call and let him know! Sam, 16, LeicesterI love Friends because it’s one of the first series (in another language) I ever watched. When I watch episodes again, it’s like going back to my comfort zone.If I had to choose a favourite episode it would be the one when Phoebe and Ross discover that Monica and Chandler have been going out. It’s SO funny … but I think I watched it too many times. Sol, 16, Rosario, ArgentinaFriends has surprisingly been a conservation-starter with a few of my friends. It’s like the glue that sticks us together. Plus, the show stands as the epitome of how friendship should be. Whenever I watch Friends, I fantasise about a friendship circle I would like to have. The silly jokes and the awkwardness between the characters are bonuses.My stand-out character is Phoebe because she is silly but smart and knowledgeable. For a person who you might think would have anger bottled up, she seems pretty calm. She takes control of her own life and she is not abashed about what she does and what she thinks. Hal, 17, IndiaFriends handles issues such as orce, unemployment and unrequited love in an excellently comedic way. It perfectly captures sibling rivalry between Ross and Monica that is surprisingly relatable. It looks at the difference of class and intellect between the friends and you get to know each one personally until you realise there is more to them than meets the eye.My favourite character has to be Chandler. His witty lines, physical comedy and mannerisms just turn him into a super lovable character. Also he’s kinda fit (good looking)! I think everyone has parts of all the characters in them, no matter how much you try not to. (Ross is my least favourite character. He’s so ANNOYING).All the episodes are really funny! If I had to choose a favourite, it would either be the one where Chandler hooks up with one of Joey’s sisters but can’t remember which one, or (spoiler alert) the one where Ross and Rachel finally start dating.

Widely referred to as “the Grindr killer” in the media, the former chef met his victims using dating apps and drugged them with lethal amounts of the date-rape drug GHB, before raping them and dumping their bodies near his home in Barking, east London.Despite the similarities of the circumstances around the men’s deaths, the politan police initially did not connect the four cases.

Hardwood floors and brick fireplaces and a billiards table and fitness room add to the appeal.But like many unassuming suburban homes, this one holds a dark secret whose true nature is withheld until the final act.The house, on the market for $750,000, is currently rented out, the listing explains, for $750 a night on weekdays and $2,000 a night at weekends – “for private parties or entertainment”.Hm. What’s going on here?Then, 31 pictures in to the 48-image real estate slideshow, it starts to become clear.There’s a shot of a curious stained-wood structure in the basement, which appears to be some sort of recreational equipment. These people have another gym … in the bedroom? Maybe you scrolled past quickly and on to the next photo, which opens up into a more expansive view of the bearskin rugs. And what’s that in the corner? Wait, is that a suit of armor?Then it’s back upstairs into the lovely dining room. But the nagging suspicion that you saw something down in the basement starts to come back. Then it hits you. Oh. Oh. That’s what they meant by “50 Shades …”Toward the end of the slideshow things start to come into focus. That’s not a piece of gym equipment: it’s a scaffold with all manner of dangling restraints and chains.Nearby there’s a large X-like crucifix, with what appear to be shackles for the hands and feet.On the wall are hung whips and chains, and around the corner there’s a … what is that? A pommel horse? What do you do on that? There appear to stocks attached to a bed.And is that a star-shaped rack?OK, so that’s what they mean by renting it out for entertainment. No wonder it costs so much. The cleaning fees must really add up.Not that there’s anything wrong with that. People in the suburbs can and should do whatever they want. And it does seem like a lovely home, all things considered. It’s near the “award-winning Upper Dublin school district”, the listing concludes. “House is being sold furnished.”Shortly after word of the unusual sale spread, the property website Redfin scrubbed the pertinent photographs from the listing. It also edited a sentence that read “full finished walk-out basement with Bilco doors, includes a gym or fifth bedroom and also is a private adult sexual oasis”.Luckily, the property was also listed in all its full glory on rival property site Zillow (at least it still was at the time of publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fb13e3153d8ec5d3e2c032083b866733a805197/159_47_773_463/master/773.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f4b7484eeeee1750c3ff37a2b34c098","title":"thai princess to run for prime minister against ruling military junta","story":"Former princess would be first member of royal family to try to run for officeThe king of Thailand has denounced his sister after she announced an unprecedented bid to become prime minister.A run by Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi, who renounced her royal title and privileges when she married an American in the 1970s, would pose an unexpected challenge to the military junta that has ruled Thailand since a coup nearly five years ago.Ubolratana announced on Thursday she would represent a party associated with the exiled telecoms tycoon and former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, in a move so bold that analysts said it must have been approved by her brother King Vajiralongkorn.But hours later the king made a televised statement suggesting he had been caught by surprise. “Involvement of a high-ranking member of the royal family in politics, in whatever way, is an act that conflicts with the country’s traditions, customs and culture and therefore is considered extremely inappropriate,” he said.The king’s opposition to the move is likely to lead to Ubolratana’s disqualification by the election commission.Ubolratana said she was simply exercising her rights as a citizen, but registration papers that listed her legal residence as Boromphiman Throne Hall and the Grand Palace underline just how exceptional her prospective candidacy is.The monarchy is one of Thailand’s most revered and respected institutions. Although she is technically no longer a princess, Ubolratana, 67, would be the first member of the royal family to attempt to run for public office.Until Friday the frontrunner in the long-awaited elections was Prayut Chan-o-cha, the leader of the 2014 coup and head of the ruling military junta, who said he was running to maintain peace and order. After repeatedly delaying elections and tightening controls on opposition parties, he had been widely expected to return as prime minister.Ubolratana’s unconventional foray into politics comes after decades of defying expectations. The eldest child of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in 2016 after a 70-year reign, she gave up her official royal title when she married Peter Ladd Jensen, a US citizen and fellow Massachusetts Institute of Technology student, in 1972.After having three children, they orced and she later moved back to Thailand where she began a second life as an unusually accessible royal, posting regularly on Instagram. In addition to acting and singing, she carries out charity work, including leading an anti-drugs campaign.“I have relinquished my royal titles and lived as a commoner,” she said in an Instagram post announcing her decision to run. She was not present when the party submitted papers registering her as a candidate.“I have accepted the Thai Raksa Chart party nomination for prime minister to show my rights and freedom without any privileges above other fellow Thai citizens under the constitution,” she wrote.Thai Raksa Chart was created by Thaksin’s main Pheu Thai party, originally intended as a possible proxy after the military junta threatened to dissolve Pheu Thai.Ubolratana has openly maintained ties with Thaksin, who was ousted in a coup in 2006 and has led the party from abroad after fleeing into exile. The two were seen together at the football World Cup in Moscow last summer.King Vajiralongkorn will be formally crowned later this year. He trained at Duntroon military college in Australia and holds several military titles, as well as a pilot’s licence. For decades, however, he showed little interest in the public duties expected of one of the world’s most revered monarchies."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3787383.1549666520!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ucd comes out on top in second semi final of irish times debate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Ross Merriman and Conor White of UCD’s law society go through to the ‘’ Debate final. Photograph: Cailean CoffeyThe second semi-final of The  Debate 2018-19 was an intensely competitive affair, as UCD’S law society team won out on a night when students debate whether to ban imports from Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory.The debate, which took place in UCC, heard a debate over whether the house should support the passing of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018.The proposed legislation, making its way through the Oireachtas, would make it an offence for a person to import or sell goods or services originating in the occupied territory.The debate saw contributors from UCC, UCD’s law and history society, Trinity’s philosophical Society, UCD’s law society, UCD’s medical society and DIT offer a variety of views.The first speaker of the evening, UCC’s Ross O’Donohue, proposing\u0026nbspthe motion, highlighted Ireland’s own history of oppression and how this should help Irish people empathise with those in Palestine.The first opposition speaker, TCD’s Amelia Melanson, spoke about the minimal economic impact on bill would have on Israel\u0026nbspand how it would inhibit real political action being pursued through the European Union.DIT’s Rachel Orr, asked the house to consider not only the bill’s impact on Palestinians and Israelis, but also on citizens of Ireland.“This bill does not discriminate between illegal settlements and legitimate states,” she said.Orr argued that the bill “allows us to continue to support a two-state solution and allows us to continue to criticise both sides.”UCD’s law society member Ross Merriman, the fourth speaker of the evening, argued that this bill was merely “political posturing\u0026nbspfrom the Oireachtas.He said it would discourage Palestinians to start business, and also potentially resurrect anti-semitism in Ireland.Jewish companies, he said, could be faced with having the gardaí call on them to determine if they used illegal materials outlawed in the bill.One of the final speakers of this semi-final was Lucille Knight of Trinity’s philosophical society.In her speech, Knight proposed that “not only is this bill economically pointless, it’s against EU financial law”.She asserted the belief from the opposition side that in order to trigger true change in the West Bank, international change was required. If Ireland passed this bill alone, it meant nothing to the Palestinians.In her closing argument, she said the Irish Government “should do both the people of Ireland and Palestine proud by putting together a bill that will actually have an impact on Israeli settlements”.In the end, it was UCD law society’s Ross Merriman and Conor White’s combination of charisma, know-how and ability to pack-a-punch that won out on the day.Inidual debater Shane Kelly, who opposed the motion, also makes it to the grand final, which takes place in UCD on the 22nd of February."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Number of past alleged abusers identified by Scouting Ireland increases to 237Private dinner meeting described as \u0026lsquowarm\u0026rsquo by aides also focused on stalled NI assemblyStudent debate whether to ban imports from Israeli settlements in Palestinian territoryEvent on the future of European democracy hears concern in advance of electionsTwo passengers taken to University Hospital LimerickMan (35) left with \u0026lsquopotentially life-changing injury\u0026rsquo following attack on Friday eveningLabelling of foreign chicken \u0026lsquomade in Wicklow\u0026rsquo is lawful, says Food Safety AuthorityLabour Court talks between INMO and health managers to continue on SaturdaySettlement agreed after claim law required assessment within 3 months of applicationCompany portrays itself as Irish but doesn\u0026rsquot fly the Irish flag, Siptu saysJury watches video of Kilkee murder accused\u0026rsquos interviews with garda\u0026iacuteOireachtas committee wary of gilets jaunes-style public backlashTaoiseach defends Donald Tusk\u0026rsquos remark there is a \u0026lsquospecial place in hell\u0026rsquo for BrexiteersAncient Order of Hibernians urges giant to pull products depicting drunken stereotypesWinds of up 120 kmh recorded in Co Galway while Storm Erik closes Salthill promenadeTwo heavily polluted sites remain as major regional park set to open this summerSize of organisation and proliferation of online betting increases risk, barrister saysHomeless charity tried to deliver items to asylum seekers living at Mosney, Co MeathGarda\u0026iacute name Darndale victim as John Lawless and issue fresh appeal for witnessesFew people believe, at this point anyway, that Harris will be forced to resign on the issue"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3787318.1549658601!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"consumers must wait until 2020 to be sure of chicken origins","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKerry Foods said the ‘Made in Wicklow’ claim refers to the product being cooked, cooled, sliced, packaged and labelled in Co Wicklow. The chicken itself is sourced ‘from Europe’.Consumers will have to wait until after April 2020 until they can be sure of the provenance of agricultural products, it has emerged after a row over “Wicklow” chicken. Members of the Irish Farmers Association picketed the Shillelagh, Co Wicklow plant of Kerry Foods on Friday in protest that the group was selling pre-packaged chicken slices bearing the description “made in Wicklow”, when in fact the chicken was not produced in Ireland. Kerry Foods initially said the chicken slices sold under the group’s Denny label were produced from chicken raised in Brazil, but later amended this to say all its chicken and pork was sourced from the EU. Addressing the protest in Shillelagh IFA Poultry committee chairman Andy Boylan said chicken growers were demanding a commitment from Kerry Foods to support Irish-produced chicken. Mr Boylan said the clarification from the company “only adds to the general confusion for consumers”. He said the IFA wants the country-of-origin of the primary source of meat used in prepared foods such as Denny products to be clearly stated on the packaging. This was necessary to “stop misleading Irish consumers who thought they were buying locally-produced food”, he said.The Food Safety Authority of Ireland said under EU legislation country of origin labelling is mandatory for some prepacked products, but generally not for processed foods. “So in other words a product could be determined under EU legislation as originating from a particular country, if it underwent substantial transformation in that country,” the authority said in a statement. However, the authority added that it recognises “that for most consumers when they see origin indicated on a product particularly one that contains meat, they assume that the indication refers to the meat ingredient and not to the product itself”.The authority said this had been noted by the EU which will apply new rules from April 1st, 2020. Under these rules, if a label states that the product comes from a particular location or uses graphics implying the product is from a particular country, then they will have to indicate where the principal ingredient came from.New rulesIn the case of a product that contains chicken and states “made in Ireland” but the chicken ingredient came from a country other than Ireland, then from April next year the food business must: (a) indicate the country of origin or place of provenance of the primary ingredient in question or(b) indicate that the country of origin or place of provenance of the primary ingredient is different to that of the food.A spokeswoman said however as this was EU legislation there was little that could legally be done to force food processors here to be more descriptive before the new rules come in to force. But Mr Boylan said the legislation was a “loophole”.  “This loophole in the current labelling legislation that Kerry Foods are exploiting to mislead consumers reinforces the importance of trusting the Bord Bia Quality Assurance label,” he said. He said “poultry farmers have had their margins squeezed with all inputs increasing by 15-30per cent in the past two years”. “They need an increase to cover their costs, and don’t want to see an Irish food company, Kerry Foods, and their brand Denny which is perceived as an Irish brand, using imported product.”Mr Boylan said the Irish consumer “values and trusts Irish poultry and all food processors should support locally produced chicken”. “For Kerry Foods to import chicken from across the globe when the most efficiently produced chicken is produced on their doorstep here is a disgrace and needs to be rectified.”In a statement, Kerry Foods said it was one of the largest purchasers of meat in Ireland, and only used industry trusted approved suppliers. “All our Denny chicken is sourced from Europe from trusted suppliers that meet our strict quality criteria. Our packaging fully complies with the strict EU labelling regulations.”“The “Made in Wicklow” claim refers to the product being cooked, cooled, sliced, packaged and labelled in Co Wicklow. Our Denny Chicken is fully prepared and packaged on our Shillelagh site, Co Wicklow where we employ 750 people.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3787221.1549651492!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"van carrying toys clothes turned away from direct provision centre","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Mosney direct provision centre in Co Meath. File photograph: Cyril ByrneManagement at the direct provision centre at Mosney in Co Meath is to contact a voluntary homeless organisation after a van delivering toys and clothes was turned away from the former holiday camp on Friday.Inner City Helping Homeless (ICHH) said its mobile outreach unit attempted to deliver leftover Christmas shoeboxes put together by members of the public to the children in the centre after it made an arrangement with staff there. It said items had been delivered there before Christmas “without any issue”.“This morning security refused to allow our van to deliver these items that were intended to give the children living in direct provision something to smile about,” said Anthony Flynn of ICHH.“Our van is marked with all of the ICHH details and we are a registered charity, however none of this mattered to security who claimed we could have had someone hidden in the back of the van.“Our driver allowed them to check the back of the van and advised that this was prearranged, however they refused to budge. At this point the lady that had made the arrangements came to the gate and begged the security to allow the shoeboxes in for the children but they completely refused.”‘Bureaucracy’Mr Flynn said the refusal to allow the van in was “bureaucracy at its absolute worst” and he urged State officials to follow up the matter.“This was two to three weeks in the pipeline. We have a contact in Naas. He’d engaged with the staff at the direct provision centre. He’s going to attempt to go back on Monday with the stock. There’s an engagement between us and the staff there.”He said the van was “full of toys and clothing, all brand new stock” and that people had, on a voluntary basis, given over two days putting it together.“I’m sure the staff on site had probably told the children this was on the way,” Mr Flynn added.A spokesman for the Department of Justice said the Mosney accommodation centre welcomes support for its residents and has a long track record of encouraging that support in the community.He said accommodation centres for international protection applicants are “governed by strict rules to ensure they meet their obligations under the law to protect the identity of residents”.He said Mosney had informed the department that “while they regularly welcome deliveries of this nature, on this occasion the centre was not notified beforehand which meant it could not be cleared by security”.The spokesman said management at the centre would contact ICHH to re-arrange the delivery of the presents and thank them for their support.The centre opened in December 2000 has just under 700 people living in it, according to latest figures. According to the Reception and Integration Agency the contractor for the Mosney direct provision centre was paid €123.5 million by the State from 2000 to the middle of 2016."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit an idiot s guide to the united kingdom leaving the european union","story":"Brexit basicsBrexit - A combination of the word Britain and exit was coined in 2012 to describe the idea of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union. So it should probably have been Ukexit but Brexit trips off the tongue better.Peter Wilding, the managing director of the British Influence think tank, is credited with coining the term Brexit. Wilding was former Conservative party leader David Cameron’s media and policy director of the Conservative Party in the EU from 2005 to 2008.Wilding, who campaigned for the UK to remain within the EU, first used the phrase in 2012 before it was first used publicly by Cameron. Brexit is a first cousin, once removed, of Grexit, which was used to describe Greece’s possible departure from the euro zone during the economic crisis.David who? David Cameron is the former Conservative Party leader and British prime minister. He romped home with a big majority in 2015 riding a wave of a promise he gave to Tory hardliners to hold an inout referendum on the UK’s membership of the European Union. The feeling is\u0026nbspneither he, nor anyone else, really believed the vote would pass. His election victory is now a distant memory. Cameron is rarely seen but is sometimes spotted avoiding members of the media as he jumps into a black Range Rover. Or as Eastenders star Danny Dyer put it, Cameron, who he labelled a “twat”, was in France “with his trotters up” while everybody else was dealing with the Brexit calamity.Theresa May - Ok, so unless you’ve been living under a large rock with no wifi, you’ll know that Theresa May is the Conservative Party leader and current British prime minister. At least as long as nobody else on the planet wants the job. She became British prime minister\u0026nbspin July 2016 in the wake of the Brexit vote and the resignation of Cameron. May who will be 63 in October 2019, was first elected an MP for Maidenhead in 1997 and served as British home secretary (basically, our minister for justice) from 2010 to 2016.Article 50 - This is the “get out clause” of the Treaty of Lisbon. It grants an EU member state the power to quit the bloc unilaterally. Once triggered, it gives the departing country two years to negotiate an exit deal. Theresa May triggered the UK’s exit on March 29th, 2017, scheduling Brexit for 11pm on March 29th, 2019, and starting the countdown clock. A European Court of Justice ruling has said the UK can unilaterally withdraw its article 50 application but extending it, thereby postponing the exit, would require unanimous agreement from the European Council, the group of EU heads of state and government.The Withdrawal Agreement - This is the deal reached in November 2018 between May and the European Union on the terms under which Britain would exit the EU. Also known as the “WA”, the “orce deal” and “Theresa May’s deal” it includes a transition period of two years (and possibly longer) after Britain leaves when not much would change. It also contains a provision called the backstop that will kick in to keep the Irish Border open in the event that trading and border arrangements sufficient to achieve this aren’t reached during the transition period.Apart from the backstop, the key issues it covers are the mutual rights of EU and UK citizens now living in each other’s territory and the UK’s financial obligations to the EU (often referred to the the “orce bill”). It is not yet ratified as it is facing strong opposition in the House of Commons. The European Parliament also needs to approve it.The Political Declaration - This is a separate document also agreed in November 2018 between the two sides setting out how they hoped the future relationship will develop in key areas including trade, political and security co-operation and so on. Unlike the withdrawal agreement, this is a political (not a legal) document. So it could be tweaked to try to bring the UK parliament on side.Backstop: The backstop, part of the withdrawal agreement, is a kind of insurance policy that will kick in to ensure that there is no hard border in Ireland, no matter what the outcome is of future trade talks between the UK and the EU. The agreement involves a transition period, a kind of standstill when most current arrangements would apply until the end of 2020, at least. It can be extended up to the end of 2022. If a trade deal between the EU and UK is not finalised in this time or is not far-reaching enough to ensure that no border checks are needed, then the backstop kicks in. It would involve the whole of the UK staying in a customs union with the EU and the North also sticking to some of the rules and regulations set down in the EU single market. Both sides say they want to avoid using the backstop, or if it is triggered to ensure this only happens for a short period. The term comes from cricket it is a fielding position where the backstop stands behind the wicket-keeper to stop the ball reaching the boundary and prevent the batting team from scoring should the wicket-keeper miss it.Transition period: This is the standstill period which would start immediately the UK leaves on March 29th under the withdrawal agreement. The UK would remain in the EU trading bloc - as a member of the single market and customs union and the rights of business and citizens would remain. The transition period - sometimes referred to by the UK government as the implementation period - would last at least until December 2020. There is scope to extend it until December 2022, at the latest. Brexit supporters don’t like it as it would keep the UK tied to EU laws, but with no say in how these are changed.No-deal Brexit: This means the UK leaving at the end of March- or at some later date if an extension is agreed - without the withdrawal agreement being ratified. This would mean that all the UK’s legal links to the EU would end overnight, new trading rules and regulatory regimes would come into effect immediately. It has led to warnings of economic chaos for the UK and Ireland and more widely in some sectors such as car manufacturing.The EU Single Market - The body of rules, regulations and practices designed to allow free movement of people, capital, goods and services across the EU.The EU Customs Union - The agreement that goods can move freely within the EU with no tariffs, or special import taxes, being applied as they move from one country to another. It also involves common agreed tariff levels on goods coming into the union from outside - meaning that once they enter the EU they too can also circulate freely.Brexit lingo - the everyday phrases\u0026nbspBrexiters - these are simply people in favour of Brexit. Brexiteers are Brexiters, but not necessarily the other way around.Brexiteers - If Brexit and the Three Musketeers had a love child it would be a Brexiteer. The term is used to describe those who are fervently in favour of Brexit to the point, perhaps, where they would carry a sword to make their point. Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson are Brexiteers, although we are in no way suggesting they would resort to violence to further their cause.Arch Brexiteer- A Brexiteer with a cherry on top, imagine if Jacob Rees-Mogg or Boris Johnson had a love child with the Incredible Hulk’s angry sister.Remainer - Somebody who voted against the UK leaving the European Union. Can sometimes be heard apologising to the Irish nation on radio and television news programmes or sitting in tears in a hipster cafe in central London reading Fintan O’Toole’s latest  column.Remoaner - A derogatory term used by Brexiters, Brexiteers or Arch Brexiteers to describe a Remainer. Calling someone a remoaner is up there with calling your female work colleague a nag.Red Lines - Issues where compromise is not an option. Everyone from the Democratic Unionist Party to the Dublin Government to the British government to the Conservative party hardliners to the European Union itself have their own favourite red lines. There are so many red lines, it very quickly after June 2016 began to look like a big bowl of spaghetti and red pesto. There is a lot of talk now, in particular, about whether Theresa May will move any of her “red lines” to try the break the logjam and win House of Commons support for her deal.Strong and stable - British prime minister Theresa May called a snap election in April 2017 saying the UK needed a “strong and stable” government because of Brexit. It is an expression she would live to regret after she lost her majority and was forced to rely on the Democratic Unionist Party to prop up her minority government. The DUP are among the most vociferously opposed to the withdrawal agreement Theresa May negotiated with the EU and to the backstop. The institutions expected to guarantee strong and stable society in the UK and other democracies are now very weak and unstable.Brino or Bino - “Brexit in name only” is the position the United Kingdom might find itself in if it were to leave the EU on terms dictated to it whereby the country must align itself to such an extent that it would operate in almost the same fashion as if it were inside the EU. So it would have left the European Union but would be still subject to the same trading rules and legal obligations. Bino is the worst case scenario for those who want Brexit.Irexit - A second cousin of both Brexit and Grexit, this describes Ireland’s exit from the European Union, which of course if very unlikely to happen any time in the near future. The most recent Eurobarometer survey shows Irish people to be more than happy with EU membership, notwithstanding our relationship with European authorities during the economic crash.Regrexit: The feeling of regret and guilt for voting in favour of Brexit. The phenomenon was felt as soon as the morning after the vote in June 2016 as it is thought many voted for Brexit as a protest against other issues with the assumption it would not pass. Doh!Nebulous - What Theresa May accused European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker of calling her during a Brussels showdown in December. That’s according to lip-readers. He was calling “the British position” nebulous, he insisted. The whole episode was caught on camera and the entire world collectively wished Mammy and Daddy would stop arguing. Explaining the episode afterwards May said: “I had a robust discussion with Jean-Claude Juncker. I think that’s the sort of discussion you’re able to have when you’ve developed a working relationship and you work together. And what came out of that was his clarity that when he used that particular phrase he’d been talking about the general level of debate. I had further conversations with him through the morning,” she said.Nebulous (2) - Lady Sylia Hermon described the proposals in an amendment supported by Theresa May’s government to come up with an “alternative” to the backstop as nebulous.Hard border - This refers to the situation where border checkpoints by police andor soldiers would be erected to regulate the movement of people and goods between the Republic of Ireland, which will continue to be in the EU and Northern Ireland, which will remain in the UK and therefore outside the European Union. The idea strikes fear into the hearts of most people on the island of Ireland and many in Britain given how much a target border infrastructure was for paramilitaries during the Troubles. Not to mention the disruption a hard border would cause to everyday life in border communities. The backstop was set up specifically to avoid the hard border.Soft or frictionless border - This describes how the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland operates now. People can move freely back and forth without even knowing which jurisdiction they are in. Think leaving Forkhill to visit your Aunty Mary in Dundalk without getting stopped by a soldier to ask what’s in the boot of your car. Goods can move freely too, with no hindrance or checks, though there are police operations against smuggling.The buzzwords\u0026nbspSecond referendum - This is a mechanism deployed in Ireland several times, designed to allow people who feel regrexit to have another bite at the cherry. Those who want a second vote say the electorate was led down the garden path the first time around, while those against it say the people have already spoken. If a second referendum were to be held it remains unclear which side would win. Remember that snap UK election Theresa May called in 2017 seeking a strong mandate from the people? They ended up with a lame duck administration propped up by the arch-Brexiteer Democratic Unionist Party. Dealing with the electorate is like trying to herd cats - anything could happen.Unless and until - The phrase used many, many times, to describe how long the provisions of the backstop would stay in place, i.e. unless or until there is an agreement that ensures no hard border in Ireland. Tánaiste Simon Coveney has been saying it at the drop of a hat. For Brexiters, Brexiteers and arch Brexiteers it is the proverbial nails on the Brexit blackboard.Time-limited backstop - A key problem in the UK parliament with the backstop plan is that – after the transition period – it commits the UK to stay in a customs union with the EU until another solution is found to the Irish border issue. For this reason there are demands to put a time-limit on the backstop. However, for Ireland and the EU this goes against the “ unless and until” commitment.Alternative arrangements - The UK argues that there are other ways to control goods flowing across the Irish border, apart from physical infrastructure. And so these are alternatives to the backstop . These include advanced customs processes and the use of specialist technology to monitor the movement of goods. The EU has promised in the draft withdrawal agreement to assess alternatives to the backstop with the UK, but has pointed out that there is no border anywhere between two trading zones where some checks do not take place .Maxfac - Maximum facilitation or “maxfac” is a phrase often used by Brexiteers to describe the idea that technology and customs processes can be used to avoid a hard border with infrastructure.The Malthouse Proposal - a plan which has found support in the Conservative Party late in the day, for the UK to exit the EU and replace the backstop with a free-trade deal with the EU combined with the use of technology to do away with customs checks. It also proposes to extend the standstill transition period until the end of 2021. It sounds like it was dreamt up in a pub but in fact it was brokered by housing minister Kit Malthouse.SoftSofter Brexit - It had been thought that Theresa May, following the rejection of her original deal in the House of Commons, might try to reach agreement on a softer version of Brexit. A softer Brexit would mean the UK remaining more closely aligned to EU rules and regulations and probably also remaining in a customs union with the EU. However there has as yet been no effort to reach this kind of deal with Labour, whose support May would need to get this over the line in the House of Commons.Canada ++ - This is the idea that the UK would end up, after Brexit, in a free trade deal with the EU similar to the one completed with Canada but hopefully involving an even closer relationship (hence, plus, or plus plus). The trading arrangements between the two sides are only due to be negotiated after Brexit takes place. If there is a no-deal Brexit and no agreement on the terms on which the UK leaves, it is not clear what the options will be for future negotiations.Norway - A Scandinavian country’s name but also used to describe the way Norway trades and relates to the European Union. The Norway model might be considered Bino by Brexiters as it would involve staying in the EU single market and subject to its rules (though overseen by a separate court). Norway-plus is sometimes used to refer to a Norway-style deal with additional membership of a customs union with the EU. This would solve the Irish Border problem but would be too close a relationship for the Brexiteers.WTO rules - If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, then it will trade with the EU and everyone else – on the basis of rules set down by the World Trade Organisation. This would involve tariffs, or special import taxes, on goods moving in and out of the UK to EU and third country markets. The UK would hope to maintain existing trade links, negotiated by the EU, with many other countries and also to do a future trade deal with the EU. There is debate on whether, immediately after leaving, the UK would immediately invoke WTO rules. It is meant to deal with all countries with which it does not have a trade deal the same, but enforcement of this is via a long drawn-out disputes process.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photo Nick Bradshaw He hasn’t gone away, you know.Peter Casey, the initial no-hoper who confounded commentators and critics by coming a strong second to Michael D Higgins in the Presidential election, was strolling around Leinster House on Thursday evening in the company of independent Senator Gerard Craughwell.The businessman’s controversial comments about Travellers, along with his musings on the various ills of Irish society – he decried the “sense of entitlement” among many people drawing state benefits in what he called our “welfare-dependent state” – ensured he became the story of the campaign and his opinions hit the mark with a significant number of voters.He took 23 per cent of the vote and dominated the lounge-bar chat and dinner-table talk of middle Ireland.The Derry-born businessman – who now ides his time between homes in Atlanta and Donegal – became friendly with Senator Craughwell when he sought his advice for what proved to be an ill-judged attempt to win a Seanad seat and they kept in touch during Casey’s presidential tilt.The voluble Senator scotched rumours on Friday that he was planning to fight the European elections in the Ireland North-West constituency as Casey’s running mate. “You have it half right,” he told us. “I certainly won’t be running. I’d be orced.”But millionaire Peter “Voice for the People of Ireland” Casey (according to his website) is rearing to go. In the Dáil bar on Thursday, he was telling people that the bookies won’t take money on his European election chances because they know he will win a seat comfortably.Craughwell has no doubt that Casey is going to declare. “You can definitely bet the house on Peter running for Europe, and you can also bet the house on him running for the next Dáil.”The sociable entrepreneur, who was in fine spirits during his visit, will not be making any announcement about his intentions until the middle of next month, after St Patrick’s Day. He is returning to America for family reasons, including the wedding of one of his sons.But there is no doubt that Casey wants to spend a lot more time in Ireland, and preferably in Leinster House.“He likes the place and he likes going in there to remind them that he hasn’t gone away,” said his chaperone, Craughwell.The politicians’ Six NationsDespite all the off-pitch noise, the annual parliamentary rugby match between the Dáil and Seanad versus the commons and lords last Saturday was a very sporting affair. Some observers may have been hoping for a vicious grudge match, but unfortunately everything passed off peacefully.The politicians’ Six Nations curtain opener has been a fixture on the Leinster HouseWestminster sporting calendar since 1992, but the result at Old Wesley was awaited with more interest than usual this year, given the awkwardness of Anglo-Irish relations these days.Unlike our gilded internationals – who promised much but were soundly beaten by England in their first game of the championship – the Irish politicians thrashed their opposition. The home side ran out convincing 34-10 winners.Fine Gael Senator Tony Lawlor, former TD for Kildare North, powered over the line from the back of a rolling maul to score the opening try. Eoghan Murphy, the Minister for Housing, who was playing in the centre alongside his department colleague, Damien English, bagged the next two tries along with the Man-of-the-Match award.The visitors pulled one back through the Labour MP for Newcastle-Under-Lyme, Paul Farrelly, before Senator Neale Richmond, captain of the Irish selection, went over another Irish try.However, Richmond injured his shoulder in the process, causing serious selection concerns for team coach Senator Maria Byrne ahead of this weekend’s visit to Scotland.More tries came from Oireachtas committee clerk Malcolm Cooney and the Irish captain’s brother, Graham Richmond. Mark Pawsey, Conservative MP for the aptly named Rugby and Bulkington, saved the visitors’ blushes with a score in injury time. Sinn Féin senator Fintan Warfield, playing at full backstop, sent over a number of conversions.Meanwhile, bruiser Tony Lawlor went against prevailing Irish and EU policy for the duration of the match by putting up and maintaining a hard border in the face of the English marauders.Afterwards, the players raised more than €2,500 for the injured players’ charitable trust at a lunch sponsored by Beauchamps Solicitors. Remarkably, Brexit was only mentioned once in the post-match speeches when an unnamed guest managed to set off a fire alarm.High drama\u0026nbspway out westThere was high drama in a west Dublin industrial estate on Wednesday night when a guest due to appear on the Tonight show with Matt Cooper and Ivan Yates got lost in a car park next to the Virgin Media studios.John Brassil, Fianna Fáil TD for Kerry, was making his debut on the political panel and made sure to allow plenty of time for his journey from Leinster House to the station, which is located way out in Ballymount Business Park, off the M50.“I left nice and early because I heard people got lost before trying to find the place,” he told us afterwards. “I saw the gates and drove in before realising that I had gone into an industrial estate called Fashion City. I drove around and around but couldn’t find any way out. The show was starting in about 15 minutes and I realised I was locked in and there was nobody about.”Brassil discovered the following morning that the gates automatically lock at a certain time in the night and he had entered just before the cut-off point.There were anxious phone calls from the studio and a man was dispatched to find the lost TD, who was penned in behind a 3m spear-tipped steel railing. A truck driver, parked up nearby for the night, heard the shouts from the two men and drove his vehicle to the gates to see if he could help. Brassil, meanwhile, parked his car against the perimeter, stood on the bonnet and somehow hauled himself up and over with the help of the others.“It was dark and pouring rain and I was sure I was going to be impaled on the bloody thing.”Following a mad dash to the studios, where the TD was quickly dried off and had some make-up fired onto his face, he was pushed out to join the rest of the panel as the opening, recorded interview with outgoing MEP Brian Hayes aired.To make matters worse, one of the guests was Michael Healy-Rae, his constituency rival. There is no love lost between the two. It would not be wrong to deduce that Healy-Rae derived great enjoyment from his colleague’s discombobulation.After the show, Fine Gael Minister of State Patrick O’Donovan drove his Fianna Fáil colleague home. Brassil returned by taxi at 6am the following morning to retrieve his car.However, gleeful reports from some quarters that the Kerry TD “tore the arse out of his trousers” have been dismissed as untrue by Brassil and other witnesses on the night.Winston Churchtown and the Independent AllianceIs there no end to Shane Ross’s talents?He was out and about in his Dublin-Rathdown constituency early last Saturday morning, walking among the people and doing good works. He pitched up in an icy Marley Park to perform marshalling duties at the weekly 5km run.As the runners passed, the Minister for Sport, aka Winston Churchtown, bellowed on continuous loop: “Watch out – there’s a slippery patch ahead!”Winston must be psychic. Or maybe Simon Harris was taking part.His Independent Alliance colleague Katherine Zappone became the first Independent Alliance minister to take Leaders’ Questions in the Dáil when she stood in for Tánaiste Simon Coveney on Thursday, which is the day when deputy leaders or their stand-ins get some time in the limelight.Apart from revealing that her father used to sell health food and vitamins, the most interesting aspect of her contribution was her more detached approach to the children’s hospital controversy compared to that of her Fine Gael cabinet colleagues.When twice pressed on whether she believes it credible that senior officials failed to inform their Ministers about serious cost overruns in the children’s hospital building project, the best she should could manage to say to Labour’s Brendan Howlin, with her arms tightly folded, was: “I don’t know what was going on in their minds but I do understand your question ‘was it credible?’. Yes I understand that, I understand what you’re asking: that there is a question. But I’m not going to answer it.”Meanwhile, the happiest member of the Alliance these days has to be Minister of State, Finian McGrath, who finally got his wish to represent Ireland in Cuba as part the annual St Patrick’s week ministerial airlift. It would explain why he was happily posing for photos in the Members bar recently with a box of Cuban cigars.Ace of SpadsFine Gael’s ministerial advisors had a special meeting away from Government Buildings on Friday where they worked on how they could do an ever better job than they are now doing for their political masters. There’s an awful lot of them, so there must have been a very big room in the Irish Aviation Authority headquarters in the old  building on D’Olier St.It was organised by John Carroll, the former CEO of the Public Relations Consultants Association who is now Special Advisor to the Taoiseach with the title “Head of Policy and Programme Implementation”.Lunch would be laid on, he informed the Spads, but they would each have to do some work first by preparing answers to three questions: the one specific thing they want Fine Gael to achieve in government what are the three “frustrations or challenges” preventing them from doing their job effectively and what do they think are the “three big political risks we are facing.”Maybe they should have booked a second day."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3787386.1549667904!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach and may discuss brexit overall state of play in dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar and UK prime minister Theresa May in Farmleigh House, Dublin Photograph: AFPMaxwellsGetty Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and British prime minister Theresa May discussed Brexit and Northern Ireland at a private dinner in Farmleigh House in Dublin last night at an occasion described by aides as “warm”, in contrast to some of their previous meetings.Irish sources said that Mr Varadkar and Mrs May discussed the continuing absence of an administration in the North and also the “overall state of play” on Brexit, but were tight-lipped about any conclusions.Irish officials stressed that the dinner in no way involved “negotiations” on Brexit or the backstop, stressing that negotiations take place in Brussels between the EU’s negotiating team led by Michel Barnier and the UK government team.The dinner was also attended by senior officials from Downing St, including the prime minister’s chief of staff Gavin Barwell and chief Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins.The Taoiseach’s chief of staff Brian Murphy, top Brexit official John Callinan and the secretary general of the Department of the Taoiseach Martin Fraser, also attended, Government Buildings said.The Attorney General Seamus Woulfe also met his British counterpart Geoffrey Cox in Dublin yesterday.Common travel areaBritish reports suggested that they discussed the backstop, but Irish government sources disputed this, saying that the talks focussed on the arrangements for the common travel area between the two jurisdictions.“They met to compare notes on a number of issues including the work of their respective departments,” a spokesman said,Officials in Dublin had played down expectations for the meeting, which was held at Downing St’s request and said that the two leaders would discuss the prospects for a resuscitation of the power-sharing institutions in Stormont, as well as Brexit issues.Earlier speaking in Belfast where he was holding a series of meetings with the Northern parties, Mr Varadkar said it was “not a day for negotiations” but that it was an opportunity to “share perspectives”.Mrs May has said that she is seeking legally binding changes to the backstop previously agreed as part of the Withdrawal Treaty in order to secure support for a deal which would enable an agreed exit from the EU at the end of next month.EU leaders have signalled a willingness to provide assurances and commitments about the temporary nature of the backstop in the non-legally binding political declaration which will accompany the withdrawal treaty, but have said the treaty itself – including the backstop – is not open for renegotiation.The Dublin visit comes at the end of a week of shuttle diplomacy in the EU with visits to Brussels by both the Taoiseach and Mrs May to discuss Brexit issues with the leaders of the EU institutions.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: ReutersFrancois LenoirA crunch vote in which MPs could force Theresa May’s hand on Brexit is set to be delayed until the end of the month or even later, it has emerged.Under the timetable agreed by the government, the British prime minister must either present a revised Brexit deal to the commons next Thursday, which appears unlikely to happen, or else table a motion to which MPs can add amendments.In a similar process just over a week ago, the commons supported Mrs May’s attempt to renegotiate the Irish backstop but voted down amendments tabled by cross-party alliances of Brexit-sceptic MPs that would have extended article 50 and given parliament more control.It had been expected the MPs would try again on Thursday if Mrs May did not return with a deal. But sources close to the group, led by the Tory MP Nick Boles and Labour’s Yvette Cooper, said it seemed likely that the prime minister would be given more time to discuss a Labour Brexit proposal and hold more talks with Brussels.“The Tory MPs are keen to give the PM a chance to follow up on the cross-party talks, and negotiations with the EU,” the source said. A Bill laying out how MPs could seek to avoid a no-deal departure might nonetheless be published next week, they said.“There’s a definite sense that lots of Tories are worried about no deal, but they don’t want to look like they are trying to obstruct her negotiations,” the source said. “There is very definitely a majority in parliament against no deal, but it’s a question of how to proceed and when.The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, who supported the last Cooper-Boles amendment, told the : “Our position is that the ball is in the PM’s court. What we do depends on what the PM does.”Any further delay would be contingent on Mrs May promising a future date for either a vote on her deal or another amendable motion, he said, adding: “Parliament has to have its say.”It sets the scene for an increasingly tense couple of weeks in which Mrs May will attempt to stitch together a Brexit plan that can get a parliamentary majority while the EU and backbenchers watch the clock tick down towards March 29th.After a bruising set of talks in Brussels on Thursday in which the European Council president Donald Tusk mentioned Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s proposals as a way of breaking the impasse, Mrs May was meeting the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, for a dinner in Dublin on Friday night.Mrs May has yet to formally respond to Mr Corbyn’s letter on Wednesday in which he said Labour would support her Brexit deal if she makes five legally binding commitments, including joining a customs union.Separately, Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage announced on Friday that he would stand as a candidate for a new “Brexit Party” to contest European Parliament elections if Britain’s departure from the EU is delayed past March 29th.“The party was founded with my full support and with the intention of fighting the European elections on May 23rd if Brexit has not been delivered by then,” the former Ukip leader wrote in an opinion piece published by the Daily . – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

And, that lack of investment means Amazon could still change course if it felt like local conditions were not as ideal as previously thought.The situation in Queens stands in contrast with how the company has proceeded in Virginia, where local leaders moved quickly to approve an incentive package to keep Amazon\u0027s interest in the region. New York politicians are still mulling over their own package, which is not expected to receive approval until 2020.Should Amazon choose to scrap its plans for New York City, the company would still theoretically have plenty of options after having received numerous proposals from all over North America during a lengthy bidding process.Among the politicians in New York State who have spoken out against the deal are Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district borders the areas chosen by Amazon for development. In the aftermath of the public announcement, opponents have gone door to door in the Queens neighbourhood to warn residents of coming rent hikes if the tech giant moves in.It is not clear what Amazon would do in the case that New York ultimately abandons its plan to offer an incentive package, and some analysts have noted that the company could still develop in the city on a smaller scale. Other tech giants, like Google, have notable already opened up facilities in the city with that strategy.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A rising hash rate will also raise concerns about bitcoin\u0027s environmental impact, with its electricity consumption estimated to be more than the country of Ireland.Other analysts had warned that a fall below $3,000 would have signalled a blood bath for bitcoin, as traders sought to offload the crashing cryptocurrency.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For good reason: the life of Elizabeth Morgan, née Caswell, is like a plotline on Call the Midwife. Morgan was born in Castleside, County Durham, as an unexpected twin to a family so poor\u0026nbspshe had to sleep in a drawer.Aged\u0026nbsp16\u0026nbspshe qualified as a nurse and worked in the Edinburgh slums. After responding to an advert from the Department for International\u0026nbspDevelopment in the 1970s, she was posted to Borneo\u0026nbspwhere she delivered babies in the rainforest and set up medical centres in remote tribal villages. By the time she came home, she had been involved in delivering the last ever smallpox vaccine.Michelle Obama’s memoir promotion will look like ‘a Madonna tour’This simple summerhouse near Berlin hides the most incredible storyPrince’s memoir will finally be released later this yearFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMorgan had been to classes to learn how to write a memoir. She tried to write down the things she had experienced, but they always looked like lists of dates. Then last year, when she learned she had an aggressive form of breast cancer, her daughter knew it was their last chance. Ms Stewart says: “We thought if we didn’t get it written down we never would.”In February, Ms Stewart and her mother received four bound copies of their mother’s hardback memoir: Elizabeth Caswell: Ai ya, Sister!\u0026nbspElizabeth appeared in a black and white portrait on the cover: a striking\u0026nbspdark-haired woman with clear eyes and a prim white nurses hat. The memoir is one of hundreds that have been produced by Story Terrace, a startup founded on the idea\u0026nbspthere should be a biographer for every person. Using ghostwriters, it plans to turn a million life stories into books within 10 years.\u0026nbsp“It’s like social media for writing books, you find the person who fits with you,” Ms Stewart says. \u0026nbspShe had looked at hiring a biographer before, but had always been put off by the cost, which ran into the thousands. On the Story Terrace website, she\u0026nbspwas able to browse writers, read sample chapters and select a package starting at £1,500 for four\u0026nbsphours of interviews and four copies of a 60-page colour hardback book.\u0026nbspRutger Bruining, who started Story Terrace in the Netherlands in 2014, got the idea for a bespoke writing service after he saw\u0026nbspAustralian company Freelancer,\u0026nbspa platform described as “the world’s largest marketplace for outsourcing” where people can compete for jobs,\u0026nbspgo public. In 2013\u0026nbspthe company was forced to close its initial public offering (IPO) early after demand overwhelmed supply of the 30 million shares offered.\u0026nbspThe IPO caught Bruining’s attention. He had been thinking about scalable ways to tell people’s stories. After a stint in management consultancy, he did an MBA at Columbia University in New York and then returned to Europe to work in private equity in London. He saw the Freelancer IPO and was struck by two things: the site hosted really good writers who were offering their services to anyone, and the founders were using software to manage freelancers all around the world.\u0026nbspThis technology opened up the possibilities for a memoir-writing agency. Rather than hire 20 staff writers to work with customers, Story Terrace works with 500 writers and matches them to clients based on their location, education and cost, among other factors. “We can do that anywhere in the world, and we can still make beautiful books for people,” Mr Bruining says. “Without tech that wouldn’t be possible.”Story Terrace recommended a writer called Judy Brown to tell Elizabeth Morgan’s story. The family were allocated several hours, but Ms Stewart says they spent a productive afternoon. Ms Brown came to see her mother despite a broken ankle and asked gentle questions that started to reveal a narrative. Ms Brown says that process of getting to know a client well enough to inhabit their voice “can take a few gos”, but describes the process as an honour. “It makes people feel like they have done something. Until you look back and you see the story as a whole it can be hard to see quite how much you’ve achieved.”Neither Mr Bruining nor Ms Brown reveal writers’\u0026nbsprates. The former\u0026nbspsays the writers, who get paid a set fee per job, are “by far the biggest cost” to the business. Ms Brown, who is retired and has worked on as many as 14 memoirs through Story Terrace, says\u0026nbspthe work provides useful extra income, but that it would be difficult to make a full-time living out of it.Story Terrace launched in the UK in 2016 and has now had 700 clients globally. The company raised £590,000 in a crowdfunding round with Seedrs in 2017, taking the total value raised to £1.5m. Mr Bruining says the money is going towards building a “bookmaker platform” that will automate the design processes so they no longer have to employ inhouse designers.The next task will be to scale. In January\u0026nbspthe company recruited Francois Coumau, a former eBay executive, to make new hires and smooth processes as the company grows. Angela Watts has joined after spending eight years at Spotify in the lead up to its IPO, to work on building awareness of the brand. Ms Watts says\u0026nbspshe was impressed by the early success of the service: “Story Terrace’s growth to date is admirable for a company creating a completely new product category – and they’ve only just scratched the surface.”\u0026nbspHalf the books commissioned on Story Terrace are gifts, often from relatives. Many have revealed extraordinary stories. A woman called Teresa Ibrahim has narrated her story growing up in poverty in rural Sudan, “in the fog of civil war”, to setting up charities for the education and empowerment of other displaced women. Another\u0026nbspexplores the journey of a Mongolian child to Britain in 1998 as one of the first generation of post-Soviet Mongolians allowed to leave the former communist regime. \u0026nbspFive real life stories that will change what you believe aboutAlison Stewart says her mother, now 80,\u0026nbspnever thought her story was that special. But the process of writing the book has brought back many memories, from the ambulance men who used to flirt with her at the Mayday Hospital in Croydon, to the sudden surfacing of a whole set of photos from her graduation as a nurse.Ms Stewart, who has a passion for working out her family history, imagines the book will sit alongside her other research: from the family tree, to the diary of her great great grandfather, who was born in 1801. “I’ll put them all together,” she says. “In 100 years, someone else will be able to find it.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And, that lack of investment means Amazon could still change course if it felt like local conditions were not as ideal as previously thought.The situation in Queens stands in contrast with how the company has proceeded in Virginia, where local leaders moved quickly to approve an incentive package to keep Amazon\u0027s interest in the region. New York politicians are still mulling over their own package, which is not expected to receive approval until 2020.Should Amazon choose to scrap its plans for New York City, the company would still theoretically have plenty of options after having received numerous proposals from all over North America during a lengthy bidding process.Among the politicians in New York State who have spoken out against the deal are Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district borders the areas chosen by Amazon for development. In the aftermath of the public announcement, opponents have gone door to door in the Queens neighbourhood to warn residents of coming rent hikes if the tech giant moves in.It is not clear what Amazon would do in the case that New York ultimately abandons its plan to offer an incentive package, and some analysts have noted that the company could still develop in the city on a smaller scale. Other tech giants, like Google, have notable already opened up facilities in the city with that strategy.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So we decided to change it.“However, in hindsight I think that was a hasty decision. We could have put more effort into looking at whether we could have adapted it to make sure it was inclusive of everybody.“I have apologised to the parents and we will consider putting it on in future years if we can make sure those bits are edited so it is inclusive for everybody.”The head added that the chair of governors had not played a part in the decision to cancel the play.Stephen Evans, CEO of the National Secular Society, said: “We’re seeing a worrying trend of parents pressuring headteachers and threatening to withdraw children when teaching doesn’t fit their, often narrow, worldview.“Schools should broaden pupils’ horizons and need to be supported to do that when faced with external pressure demanding that the education their children receive conforms with parents’ religious views.”Theory of evolutionOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Until the other day, I had no idea that a sausage even had any meaning (unless, that is, you happen to be ravenously hungry). Imagine the surprise, therefore, of the conservators in London who, back in 1983, were sprucing up a classic painting by the 17th-century Dutch master Jan Steen, when they discovered a lost sausage. Or rather not so much lost as “disappeared”.\u0026nbspYou can see that painting, Celebrating the Birth, in all its domestic glory, in the wonderful Wallace Collection in Manchester Square, just off Oxford Street. But prior to 1983 you would not have seen the sausage, or indeed the hand of the long-haired artist himself, about to go out of the door at the back of the kitchen, holding two fingers over the head of the babe. Painting “cleaners” (or conservators) are sometimes like detectives carefully inspecting the scene of a crime. In this case their research took them back to the Victorian period when the works of Shakespeare could be re-written for the purpose of making more of a happy ending – and when the statue of a naked David in the V\u0026ampA could have a fig-leaf applied to the relevant parts on the occasion of a visit from Queen Victoria.Probably sometime in the 1850s, a skilful painter had been employed to paint over (rather as you might use software today to remove undesirable elements from your favourite holiday snap) the offending sausage and the two-fingered salute – originally dating from 1664 (the year is\u0026nbspspelt out in the painting itself). But what was the big deal about the sausage anyway? How could hypersensitive Victorian morality be offended by the depiction thereof?For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialI had the advantage of being accompanied by the very knowledgeable Anne Fay, head of education at the Wallace Collection, but you can work it all out for yourself just by looking very intently at the restored painting, now hanging in East Gallery II. In Holland you can still talk about a “Jan Steen” household or room. But the phrase isn’t necessarily complimentary. It doesn’t mean “beautiful” or “artistic”, but rather “chaotic” or “messy”. “Celebrating the birth” depicts a busy, bustling kitchen scene or “lying-in room”.There are 16 people crowded into the room (counting the babe), with a lot of cooking going on around the fireplace. In the foreground, lying on the floor are several broken eggshells together with pots of what looks like maple syrup and a roll on a plate. A buxom cook is leaning over a cooking pot mixing some kind of brew with a ladle and holding out her other hand for payment.The sausage (or, technically, a string of sausages) is hanging down from above the fireplace, attached to the chimney. It is long and rather limp-looking and probably deserves the word, “dangling”. A maid is handling it, looking out of the picture directly towards the spectator, with an expression that might be roguish. But what does it mean and why would you want to paint it over? People ate sausages back then, didn’t they? Why would you not have one in a kitchen?The sausage, you will have guessed, is susceptible to a phallic reading. The prudish Victorians\u0026nbspthought so. It could be mistaken for the same sexual organ\u0026nbspthe David fig-leaf was designed to conceal. And a long but rather flaccid one at that. But, as Freud may have said, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. And isn’t a sausage sometimes nothing more than a traditional form of fast food? But now combine the sausage with the image of the painter holding up two fingers over the head of the father figure.Is this an obscene gesture? Only in the sense that the two fingers are meant to represent horns and thus signify “cuckold”. The painter, in other words, is suggesting – every father’s nightmare – that the father is not in fact the father. His wife is cheating on him. So we look carefully at the nominal father, who is holding the child in one arm and reaching into his pouch with his other hand (probably to pay the midwife). He has a grey beard and an apron, and is no spring chicken. Combined with the limp sausage, the implication is that the ageing man could be impotent and incapable of fathering a child.Who then is the father? And we should remember that there is a pregnant woman in the kitchen, sitting comfortably on the left of the scene, sipping a drink, looking rather beatific (possibly sozzled too). The leading candidate for rogue inseminator is the painter himself. Rather like Alfred Hitchcock making a brief appearance in one of his own movies, Jan Steen would often paint himself into the picture. And if he is making a point here, it is less an assertion of his own sexual prowess than the subtle reminder that indeed he and no other has given birth to every single one of the figures depicted in the painting. The two fingers are like a Steen signature, saying: “I am the artist.”The Wallace Collection is one of the nation’s great treasures but modest in scope by comparison with some of our better-known museums. And it’s housed in a building, Hertford House, that doesn’t look much like a museum either. It was originally a hunting lodge when it was built in the 18th century, with a curving driveway in front. You might not even notice it, tucked away as it is behind Selfridge’s. But the whole collection is an exercise is being more alert and noticing stuff you might not otherwise notice or know about. For example, until I had a good look at a gorgeous ancien régime chest of drawers that once adorned Versailles, I had no idea that the chest of drawers (or “commode”) was an 18th-century invention. I have no idea where they used to put their socks and smalls before then.\u0026nbspMy guide Anne Fay helpfully explained that the word “Rococo” comes from the French rocaille, meaning rocky ground or rockery, and containing elaborate references to natural configurations such as shells and pebbles. But she also directed me towards a small but bewitching painting, The Swing\u0026nbspby the French painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard (dated 1767). The central figure in this work is a pure Disney princess at first glance. The girl on the swing – or let’s say, young woman, aged perhaps 18 at most – is radiant. She seems to generate light or, to turn it around, the spotlight is all on her. She looks ecstatic and her peachy, lacey, frilly dress similarly emanates a kind of joie de vivre. Even her bergère hat is jaunty.But again, if you look carefully, there are elements in this painting that Disney, while borrowing the wardrobe, would surely prohibit. One of the girl’s dainty shoes is flying up through the air. Lying on the ground, to the left of the painting, underneath the swing, is a young man, his hat in his hand, a flower in his buttonhole, his face illuminated by the light of the girl. He too looks delighted. His gaze is directed towards the girl. But if we follow his gaze carefully we can see that he is looking right up into her dress, which is billowing open as she kicks her legs. We see a flash of bare thigh, she may or may not be wearing any underwear, we do not know. But there is a liberated, playful quality to the girl that suggests possibly not. Without any actual cameras, the painting gives us a classic scene of upskirting. But, so far as we can judge, consensual. The girl and the young man may well be lovers.\u0026nbspBut as you might expect there is a love triangle here. Look to the right of the painting and you will see, almost hidden in the shadows, a much older man, who is pulling the ropes attached to the swing – perhaps trying to pull the girl back to him. Who is he? Probably the husband. Also, quite possibly – as in the Steen painting – cuckolded, displaced in the marital bed by the younger man (who is, after all, already lying down and is being given a privileged through-the-keyhole glimpse of what is typically concealed).The girl on the swing looks entirely carefree. She is having a great time. She may be making some mocking gesture to do with her husband. But there are subtle hints in the painting that not all is well. For one thing, if you look carefully, the ropes that suspend the swing from some kind of grotto appear to be fraying. The swing itself may be unsafe. There are storm clouds gathering. The cupid figures dotted around the canvas are looking nervous. And finally, a little white-haired dog that you might not even notice, down on the right-hand side, is watching and barking. As if everything is about to go wrong. The painting is only a still, a snapshot, but it contains narratives, with alternative endingsBut probably the single most famous painting in the whole of the collection is The Laughing Cavalier, by Franz Hals (1624). Of course the irony of this painting is that the subject is neither laughing nor is he a cavalier. But he does look almost absurdly pleased with himself. He is smiling broadly and even his bristling handlebar moustache is smiling. He has rosy cheeks, curly hair, bright eyes, and is in blooming health. There are unproven theories as to who he is or was precisely. But none of that really matters. The laughing cavalier is a hyper-realistic image of vivacity, brimming over with good will and pleasure and, perhaps, anticipation.Because, as in the Fragonard, there is a suggestion of a sexual encounter to come. Is he perhaps a bridegroom looking forward to his wedding night? Or is he on his way to meet his secret lover? His richly detailed garb implies as much. The embroidered sleeve of his silk tunic (with no less than nine buttons on the cuff) is decorated with any number of symbols suggestive of a carnal union: Cupid’s arrows and lovers’ knots. But we also have a flaming cornucopia and a bee – connoting honey and sweetness but also, potentially, a sting.So Hals is being rather poised and ambiguous here. The laughing cavalier is rather like the girl on the swing, on a high, but he could conceivably come down with a bump if he’s not careful. We don’t know, we only have the immortal moment of hope and expectation. Which cannot be extinguished. But could be understood as over-optimistic. And yes, the eyes really do follow you around the room.I live a 10-minute cycle ride away from the Wallace Collection. And yet I barely knew it was there until the other day. The Wallace Collection is due mainly to Sir Richard Wallace, who was probably the illegitimate son of the 4th Marquess of Hertford and is described in a new book by Suzanne Higgott as “the most fortunate man of his day”. His collection was bequeathed to the nation by his widow, Lady Wallace, in 1897. But she didn’t leave any endowment for the purposes of upkeep.The museum, which is free to enter, now makes its living partly on the basis of retail and renting out its space. You can have a wedding party, Jan Steen-style, in the Grand Gallery for a cool £20,000. Or stage your corporate event there, in one of the most elegant settings in the country. Or just come for lunch or dinner in the courtyard café.A museum devoted to dogs is opening in New YorkInside New York’s new spy museumSalvador Dali artwork damaged \u0027by visitors taking photos\u0027 in galleryBut the paintings and fine works that are exhibited there remind you of the importance of not just seeing but looking. As one of the parables (in Mark’s gospel) says, you can see and yet not perceive. One of the great lookers (in the sense of doing the looking rather than being looked at) was Henry Moore. An exhibition of his works is opening at the Wallace in March. Moore would sit here and get inspiration in the armoury. He could see helmets were not just function they were also form. The helmet morphs, in his hands, into a symbol of protection that embraces mother and child.\u0026nbspBut what is the point of art anyway? Is it to reveal, in a Freudian way, the hidden pathways of the unconscious? To boast of the artist’s libido? One plausible evolutionary theory about the function of art maintains that it came about as an accessory to courting. A way of wooing or seducing. Come up and see my cave paintings some time. So therefore it’s not surprising if love triangles and other erotic geometries also get into the picture. But it can’t just be that surely.\u0026nbspFor anyone brought up on Monet and Picasso, the Wallace Collection, with works that date largely from before the French Revolution, comes as a bit of a shock. The level of sheer realism, in some of those Dutch paintings, is dazzling. But there is a connection with modern painters even as abstract as, say, Mark Rothko (whose work is dramatised in the play Red). All those sustained blocks of colour, or Campbell’s soup cans (as painted by Warhol), are related to The Swing and The Laughing Cavalier by virtue of the infra-ordinary – all the stuff that we normally don’t notice. Works of art ask us to be more alert. To be better sensory beings. They are telling us to pay attention to the world. To take note of little things. Even if it’s only a sausage.Andy Martin is the author of Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me. He teaches at the University of Cambridge.\u0026nbspThe exhibition, “Henry Moore: The Helmet Heads”, runs at the Wallace Collection 6 March to 23 June.

In the 1990s I sat in the stands when Tom Brady – whose New England Patriots just won their sixth Super Bowl – was not the Tom Brady we know today, but was second, even third-string, backing up other future NFL quarterbacks at Michigan.If Brits think their families’ and communities’ commitments to football clubs are more authentic than Americans’ because they go back further, they are looking to the wrong league and teams. Our connections and century-long traditions are not found in the NFL, but, rather, with our college football programs that – like your links to British football clubs – go back to the nineteenth century.Patrice Evra sparks backlash for ‘patronising’ applauding of Eni AlukoAnd our rivalries are just as fierce. Michigan’s rival of more than 100 years standing is The Ohio State University: my mother is a graduate and serious fan. She can tell you all the reasons why OSU traditions surpass the Wolverines’, and how Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh is a beautiful 0-4 versus her Buckeyes. I learned from my mom that women are real, authentic fans too.Women play and follow football, many as seriously as men. But I experienced another first in Manchester. This was also my first experience in a traditionally male workplace that was still almost entirely, unapologetically, male. The only other women I saw in the press areas were serving food or working on the social media and communications teams for Man City and Arsenal. Pep Guardiola was so surprised to see a woman in the press room post-match that, when we made eye contact, his look of shock was priceless.I get it because I’m a historian. This is your “manly” sport. In the United States, our “manly” sports, historically, also happen to be our most insular and quintessentially American sports: baseball and American football. So while they may not translate neatly, I realise we have similar man-zone problems. In my lifetime, both our countries have worked to improve ersity and inclusion in sports participation and sports industries. We both have a long way to go.For all the claims of inclusivity and ersity that I saw in the national football museum on Saturday, I did not see it reflected in the match coverage on Sunday.Here’s the thing. I know there are hundreds, thousands of women in the UK who grew up playing football, cheering for local teams. They know the game as intimately as men do. They write well. They’re clever and funny and bring unique perspectives to their descriptions and analyses of the game. So why weren’t they in the media area on Sunday, and why was Pep so surprised to see me?Created with Sketch.Male cheerleaders make history at 2019 Super Bowl  Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Inclusivity does not happen on its own. It requires ever-present work active, thoughtful decision-making by people in positions of leadership to commit to fundamental changes in their hiring practices, their mentoring cultures and professional growth opportunities, and their fostering of inclusive, healthy workplaces.\u0026nbspAfter all, the original construction of modern sport as a male domain was also man-made.\u0026nbsp(Ha.)I teach sports history at Arizona State University, and this semester I’m teaching a course on the history of baseball, or, rather, what baseball history tells us about American history.\u0026nbspHow multi-billion-dollar US college sports exploit their starsWe explore baseball’s critical role in both promoting and affirming an ideology of the supremacy of white men to hold positions of political, economic, and social authority, both within the United States and abroad.\u0026nbspThis was particularly so as the nineteenth century gave way to the twentieth when our country began to indulge its imperial ambitions beyond the North American continent. White men were fit to lead the world’s races, proving it through sporting prowess on the football gridiron and baseball diamond. This effort required pushing out people of African descent, and women, who had always been playing and loving baseball but now were forced to create their own separate – and often alternative or underground – teams and leagues to play in.When Jackie Robinson, who would have been 100 this year, desegregated Major League Baseball, joining the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, he inspired future generations of young people to stake their rightful claim to sporting spaces despite being told their identities disqualified them.\u0026nbspIdeas about who belongs – and who does not – do not stay in the sport space they leach out and influence ideas about “natural” ability and interest in broader society.Here in England, for 50 years, from 1921 to 1971, the Football Association banned women from football pitches, declaring “the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and should not be encouraged.” By no coincidence, this was at a time that women were gaining confidence both within and beyond sport, securing the right to the vote, enjoying public spaces, and demanding equal treatment in homes and workplaces.\u0026nbspWhat have I learned on my trip of firsts to the city of firsts? Sports hold incredible potential and power for social transformation. Sports are about people, and about bodies, and, most of all, they make us vulnerable. All of us. It’s in the space of vulnerability and strength and power and times of joy and times of pain that we hold the capacity and potential to see the humanity in each other.No matter the location on the planet, women athletes and sports professionals know that sports and politics have always mixed, because we’ve always had to fight so damn hard to play, to write about those who play, to coach and manage and take our seat in the boardroom. We won’t stop fighting to claim our right to play.

But the mission was retired in October, when its fuel finally run out and Nasa moved the telescope into a safe orbit and shut it down.The image – called last light, just as the first light was taken nearly ten years earlier – closes a mission that has discovered thousands of those distant worlds and brought hope that habitable planets deep in our galaxy could be waiting to be found.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialSince Kepler first opened its eye up to space and started looking for those stars, it found more than 2,600 worlds beyond our solar system – proving that planets are far more common than expected and that other places like our own Earth could be lurking out there.The image also shows some of the effect of those ten years. The blackened gaps at the middle and top of the image are where parts have failed in the camera, but Kepler was designed in a modular way that meant those problems did not affect the rest of the instrument.The final image came after Kepler\u0027s last observation campaign, for which it was pointed towards the constellation Aquarius. Lurking in the image is the TRAPPIST-1 system, which has seven rocky planets, many of which are touted as hopeful second Earths that could support life.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

That slight overlap means astronomers can compare data from the two spacecraft, helping calibrate and improve the data Nasa will go on to receive.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience.

Well beyond our galaxy, the Milky Way. Douglas Adams’\u0026nbspline from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy might well have been written especially to describe how far away they’re coming from: “I mean, you may think it’s a long way down the road to the chemist, but that’s just peanuts to space.”The Andromeda galaxy is 2.5 million light years from us the source of the FRBs detected by Chime\u0026nbspis a thousand times more distant than that.Before the project turned its hi-tech gaze on the heavens, there had been only one previously detected incident of a repeating FRB, and that was in 2012. “Knowing that there is another suggests that there could be more out there. And with more repeaters and more sources available for study, we may be able to understand these cosmic puzzles – where they’re from and what causes them,” says Ingrid Stairs, a member of the Chime team and an astrophysicist at UBC.The fact that scientists don’t know what is generating the FRBs raises the spectre that they are actually the work of some far-flung civilisation.The Seti (search for extraterrestrial intelligence) Institute in California is dedicated to finding evidence of alien life. Senior astronomer Seth Shostak wrote on the Seti website that FRBs in and of themselves weren’t necessarily cause for cracking open the champagne and laying out the interstellar welcome mat.Billions of stars across space turning into enormous crystals“It’s lore among astronomy grad students that cosmic phenomena are either singular – in other words, there’s only one in the universe – or they’re very common,” Shostak writes. “For example, some folks have argued that Earth might be unique. Maybe there’s only one such bio-friendly world in our galaxy, and we live on it.\u0026nbspBut a more frequently heard opinion is that, among the trillion planets of the Milky Way, there could be many billions that have spawned life.“When, a few years ago, only a handful of FRBs were known, it was unclear whether they were rare or otherwise. Now that more than 60 have been detected, researchers can safely say that there are probably thousands of these things going off every day. They are as ubiquitous as indoor plumbing.”The exciting bit is that the FRB discovered by Chime is repeating. Shostak explains: “There’s a short flash of radio energy – quicker than an eye blink – and then, maybe two days later, it flashes again.“The repetition tells you something about the cause of these radio flashes. Obviously, you can’t expect that colliding black holes or neutron stars are going to return to their corners and collide again a few days later. Whatever is responsible for this series of bursts has to be an ongoing phenomenon.“In addition, the phenomenon has to be tremendously energetic. The radio flashes come from billions of light years away.It’s lore among astronomy grad students that cosmic phenomena are either singular – in other words, there’s only one in the universe – or they’re very common“Clearly, something in that galaxy can muster sufficient energy to produce a signal detectable here on Earth. And it can come up with that energy every few days or so.”Taken on its own, the FRB discovery might not have caused as much general interest as it did. But the news came alongside another announcement, and that concerned ‘Oumuamua.‘Oumuamua is actually the Hawaiian word for scout, or messenger, but it has that lovely science fictional ring to it. A common trope of science fiction is the idea of the Big Dumb Object –\u0026nbspa huge, unknowable, alien structure that appears in our skies or on Earth, a mute testimony to the existence of extraterrestrial life. Think the monoliths from Arthur C Clarke’s 2001: A Space Odyssey or his novel Rendezvous with Rama, in which an enigmatic cylindrical object glides into our solar system.Clarke, who died in 2008, would have loved ‘Oumuamua. The name was coined by scientists at the University of Hawaii when they spotted the\u0026nbspstrange object passing through our system, not unlike Rama, in October 2017.‘Oumuamua was an asteroid –\u0026nbspor something similar –\u0026nbspan elongated lump of rock anything up to a kilometre long, and red in colour. It was notable in astronomical terms because it was the first time an object from outside our solar system was detected to be just passing through.There were the usual internet theories about it being something to do with aliens, of course, but they weren’t taken very seriously. Until October last year, when the chair of Harvard’s astronomy unit, Avi Loeb, went on the record to say, actually, this could be aliens, you know.Basing his statements on the observations that ‘Oumuamua appeared to accelerate at certain points during its passage past us, Loeb told German news magazine Der Spiegel that it “may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth’s vicinity by an alien civilisation”. He added: “If these beings are peaceful, we could learn a lot from them.”Scientists are generally a little wary about tossing around assertions that not only does alien life exist, but that\u0026nbspit has progressed to the point that it can disguise its spaceships as asteroids and send them spinning through the galaxy.Even Seti, which wears its heart on its sleeve when it comes to its mission to find alien life, has poured cold water on the repeating FRBs being of alien origin. Seth Shostak writes: “Aliens are frequently given the credit for causing new celestial phenomena. A half century ago, Soviet scientists suspected that quasars were actually signals broadcast by highly advanced societies far, far away. In the 1960s, British radio astronomers temporarily referred to pulsars as little green men.“But you can safely bet that aliens are not the cause of FRBs. Why? The bursters are seen all over the sky, that’s why. The same sort of signal is coming from galaxies that are generally separated by billions of light years. So how could aliens organise so much of the universe to engage in broadcasting the same sort of signal? There’s hardly been enough time since the Big Bang to coordinate such widespread teamwork, even if you can think of a reason for it!”This week The New Yorker magazine interviewed Loeb. He could reasonably have been expected to backtrack a little on his pronouncements from October regarding ‘Oumuamua. But not a bit of it. He went further, suggesting that ‘Oumuamua was some kind of solar-powered sail to account\u0026nbspfor its change in speeds, which you would not expect to see from a dead object simply drifting through space.Not believing in aliens is akin to believing the world is flat, vaccines cause autism, and the world was created in seven days. No sensible person believes we are alone in the universeLoeb told The New Yorker:\u0026nbsp“The only thing that came to my mind is that maybe the light from the sun, as it bounces off its surface, gives it an extra push. It’s just like a wind bouncing off a sail on a sailboat. So we checked that and found that you need the thickness of the object to be less than a millimetre in order for that to work. If it is indeed less than a millimetre thick, if it is pushed by the sunlight, then it is maybe a light sail, and I could not think of any natural process that would make a light sail. It is much more likely that it is being made by artificial means, by a technological civilisation.”But Loeb sounded a cautionary note for any ET fans out there. The civilisation that sent out ‘Oumuamua –\u0026nbspmuch in the same way we sent out the Voyager probes – could be long extinct, given the distances it might have travelled.But still, here’s a respected Harvard scientist saying that he believes in aliens: “I do not view the possibility of a technological civilisation as speculative, for two reasons. The first is that we exist. And the second is that at least a quarter of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy have a planet like Earth, with surface conditions that are very similar to Earth, and the chemistry of life as we know it could develop. If you roll the dice so many times, and there are tens of billions of stars in the Milky Way, it is quite likely we are not alone.”It’s the sort of thing people have been saying for years, but to hear it from such an august personage adds weight to the fact that belief in aliens is no longer confined to the tinfoil hat brigade.I punted out the question of whether aliens exist on social media. Perhaps it’s the sort of people who follow me, but nobody came out and said they didn’t believe in the existence of aliens. One reply on Twitter read: “Not believing in aliens is akin to believing the world is flat, vaccines cause autism, and the world was created in seven days. No sensible person believes we are alone in the universe.”Thinking exactly that seems to be ridiculed as much as the idea that there were aliens out there used to be not so long ago. One commenter called the idea “narcissistic” another said, “It would be bizarre to think we are the only life in the universe. Equally bizarre to believe that the universe is small enough for us ever to have the chance of meeting other life.”That last comment is perhaps indicative of the idea that while life might exist on other planets, we might never be able to get there, or vice versa.“Maybe not this year, but in the next five years,” asserts\u0026nbspauthor Rowan Coleman when I ask\u0026nbspon Facebook if 2019 is going to be a big year for aliens. “Nasa are sending probes to Europa and other moons with frozen water on them. There’s a lot of frozen water which is sometimes fluid on mars. Given that microbiotic life can survive on Earth in both freezing and boiling conditions, and in the vacuum of space, it seems pretty obvious we’d find this kind of life within our solar system.”Are aliens sending us messages from light years away?Nasa finds strange alien planet hiding outside our solar systemSatellite mistaken for meteorite crashes across sky above New ZealandNasa scientists plan to send a nuclear robot drill to hunt for aliensDo we really have a right to colonise Mars?David Darby adds:\u0026nbsp“My prediction is that everywhere you find liquid water you will find life – it has been shown to be the case on Earth no matter how extreme the environment. We may only discover microscopic unicellular life as this is the only life that can be expected within our universe. Interstellar travel times would mean that any galactic empire would probably remain undiscovered as our technology won’t get us there. Our planet has been here long enough for them to visit us if they had the technology or inclination. The fact that they haven’t would probably mean that interstellar travel is a technological problem with no solution. The one thing we can be sure of is that ‘the truth is out there’…”The idea of discovering microscopic life is one that has gained much more traction in recent years, and Coleman’s point about life on Earth surviving in extreme conditions is one that comedian Ben Miller made heavily in his recent book The Aliens Are Coming!Miller – who studied at Cambridge for a PhD in solid state physics –\u0026nbspis firmly of the belief that life is out there,\u0026nbspbut that we’re likely to find microbes before the silver spaceships come flying.He tells me about microbes that exist\u0026nbspin hot springs in Yellowstone National Park\u0026nbspin temperatures of 90C, about 30 degrees above what they should be able to withstand. If they can survive in those conditions here on Earth, why not on other planets?Are alien civilisations sending out repeating radio signals and solar-powered probes to investigate life on Earth? What used to be a belief that was cause for ridicule now seems to be much more widely accepted as not just true, but inevitable.Will we find life – whether microscopic bug\u0026nbspor galactic empire – in 2019? It feels, on recent evidence, that if we’re going to make contact, then this year, or the next, or maybe the next after that, seems increasingly likely.

It looked to be a straight-forward victory for the Spaniard as he surged into a two-set lead, but Murray is not a three-time Grand Slam champion for nothing and he supremely levelled the match despite hobbling around the court from the get-go. However, in the end his hip injury just took too much out of him, and Bautista Agut clinched a breath-taking 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (4-7), 2-6 victory to reach the second round where he\u0027ll face Australia\u0027s John MillmanBritish Prime Minister, Theresa May and her husband Philip attend Sunday morning prayers at her local church in Maidenhead, Britain, 13 January 2019.

The group was calling for the media organisation to provide further in-depth coverage of climate-related issues in future reportingDebbie Twitchen, from Landport Foodbank in Lewes, said she was “very unhappy” about the alleged policy because the food bank requires a written referral for anyone receiving a food parcel.She said she believed it was a way for the DWP to “hide that people are going hungry and needing food banks” due to “failures in the system”, and added: “I know that it’s an obvious ploy – if you can’t show figures for something then it’s not happening is it?Actor or not, the DWP video is an attempt to gloss over its crueltyUniversal credit claimants six times more likely to be in rent arrearsIn comments made on the community Facebook group Lewes Present, local MP Maria Caulfield dismissed the claims. She said:\u0026nbsp“This is not true... Not all of the food banks locally need referrals but if they do I can refer them. Please be assured that there are no changes to access.”But a caller to the centre requesting a referral\u0026nbspto food banks was advised to visit a Citizens’ Advice Bureau branch and told: “We’re no longer able to refer people to the food bank.”Ms Twitchen said she was concerned that\u0026nbsppeople wouldn’t\u0026nbspwant to put themselves in the “humiliating” situation of getting referred to a different agency.\u0026nbsp“I fear that people are going to be slipping through the net because of it,” she said.\u0026nbsp“I have people coming in in tears who are absolutely embarrassed and angry with themselves for the situation they are in – people are proud and they don’t want to admit they can’t cope. I’m really concerned that by taking away that easy option of going down to the jobcentre, people won’t come.”Helen Chiasson, coordinator of another food bank in Lewes called Fitzjohn’s, which serves between 35 and 40 households – or around 130 children and adults – said they hadn’t received any referrals from the jobcentre since the alleged changes were implemented.Universal credit claimants six times more likely to be in rent arrears“People are in a really bad state mentally but some of them are having to go to yet another place and explain their set of circumstances to another set of people. I’m worried that people will be put off using our service. The DWP have shown themselves to be a provider of a service that is inadequate.”A second leaked email from a food bank in Eastbourne, also in East Sussex, suggests that more than one jobcentre is following the no-referral advice, although it’s not clear how widespread the issue is.In one of the emails, the jobcentre worker wrote: “While we at Lewes Jobcentre have been adopting a locally agreed process, we have been advised that DWP policy does not permit Jobcentres to refer customers to foodbanks by issuing vouchers or referral forms.“We are allowed to verbally signpost them to your service and would be happy to do this, but unsure if this meets your needs.”A DWP spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbsptheir policy on food bank referrals had not changed. “Jobcentres will signpost people to food banks and other services according to their inidual circumstances, as part of their support to help people manage their finances and get into work,” the spokesperson added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We\u0026nbspwill not gamble with peace or put a sell-by date on reconciliation. This is why we insist on the backstop.”\u0026nbspMs May has promised to put forward a fresh plan for maintaining an open border in Northern Ireland by next Wednesday, but Mr Tusk warned that any new proposals from the UK must be “believeable”.\u0026nbspHe said: “Give us a believable guarantee for peace in Northern Ireland and the UK will leave the EU as a trusted friend.\u0026nbspLive – EU council president says ‘we will not gamble with peace’“I hope the UK government will present ideas that will both respect this point of view and at the same time command a clear and stable majority in the House of Commons.”His stance was echoed by Mr Varadkar, who said\u0026nbsphe was “open to further discussions” with the UK but that the current withdrawal agreement remained\u0026nbsp”the best deal possible”.He said: “While we expect that the backstop will never be used, we agreed again today that it is needed as a legal guarantee to ensure that there is no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland while protecting the integrity of our European single market and customs union.“I think the events in London and the instability in British politics\u0026nbspin recent weeks demonstrates exactly why we need a legal guarantee and a solution that is operable, that we know will work and will last.”After their joint press conference, microphones recorded Mr Varadkar joking to Mr Tusk: “They’ll give you terrible trouble in the British press.”A laughing Mr Tusk replied: “Yes I know.”The comments sparked a furious response from Brexiteers.Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said Mr Tusk has no manners, telling\u0026nbspthe BBC: “I think that what he has said is pretty unacceptable and pretty disgraceful.I\u0027m sure that when he reflects on it he may well wish he hadn\u0027t done it.The DUP’s Sammy Wilson called Mr Tusk a\u0026nbsp”devilish, trident-wielding, euro maniac”, adding: “Donald Tusk once again shows his contempt for the 17.4 million people who voted to escape the corruption of the EU and seek the paradise of a free and prosperous kingdom.

She is said to have told leaders behind closed doors that she accepts the backstop cannot be scrapped –\u0026nbspin a move likely to enrage her Eurosceptic Tory MPs.\u0026nbspEven if a Brexit deal is agreed, will we leave on 29 March?Rabid Brexiteers could learn a thing or two from TuskNearly £7,000 knocked off price of average UK home in Brexit slumpSpeaking after a meeting with the prime minister in Brussels, Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt said “we welcome” the letter the Labour leader had sent to the prime minister\u0026nbsplaying out his party’s alternative proposals.“We have reiterated that we cannot have an agreement with uncertainty in the UK based on majorities of six, seven, eight, nine votes in the House of Commons,” Mr Verhofstadt said in a joint press conference with the parliament’s president Antonio Tajani.“That cross-party cooperation is the way forward and I think I can say that we welcome the letter that Jeremy Corbyn has written to Mrs May to offer such a cross-party exit, I should say, to the Brexit.\u0026nbsp“It’s important now that this leads to a position in the UK that has the broadest possible majority so that we can conclude this negotiation.”He also confirmed that Ms May had in the meeting not sought to scrap the backstop and conceded it was necessary, adding: “Mrs May today in the meeting assured us that there will be a backstop. What she said already in Belfast: there’s no question to remove the backstop, because that is absolutely necessary for securing and safeguarding the Good Friday Agreement, internal market, and peace process.”The prime minister is understood to have received a similar message from Donald Tusk, the European Council president who represents the collective views of member states.Jeremy Corbyn writes to Theresa May outlining his five Brexit demands Sources with knowledge of the meeting between\u0026nbspMr Tusk and the prime minister said the president told Ms May that “the Corbyn plan could be a promising way out of the impasse”, according to\u0026nbspBuzzfeed News.EU officials who examined the Labour plan believe it to be broadly in line with EU negotiating guidelines, the website says.Labour last night called for a “permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union”, close alignment with the single market underpinned by “shared institutions”, protections on workers rights, and UK participation in some EU agencies. The policy moves the party closer to a so-called “Norway+” Brexit that would keep the UK in the bloc’s orbit, though technically outside.In a joint statement the British government and European Commission said Ms May had had a “robust but constructive” meeting with president Jean-Claude Juncker, and that the pair would meet again before the end of the month.The two negotiating teams have been formally stood down since the withdrawal agreement was agreed between the two sides last year, with the EU saying it did not anticipate any further meetings. But with MPs in Westminster blocking the ratification of the agreement, officials will begin meeting again.The joint statement said the gathering was “held in a spirit of working together to achieve the UK’s orderly withdrawal from the EU”.Theresa May is said to have explained the situation in Westminster to Mr Juncker and raised “various options for dealing with these concerns”.But Mr Juncker responded by underlining that the EU27 would not reopen the withdrawal agreement – describing it as ”a carefully balanced compromise between the European Union and the UK, in which both sides have made significant concessions to arrive at a deal”.He however “expressed his openness to add wording to the political declaration agreed by the EU27 and the UK in order to be more ambitious in terms of content and speed when it comes to the future relationship between the European Union and the UK”, according to the read-out of the meeting.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentThe statement concluded: “The discussion was robust but constructive. Despite the challenges, the two leaders agreed that their teams should hold talks as to whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European Council. The prime minister and the president will meet again before the end of February to take stock of these discussions.”Ms May’s meeting Mr Tusk comes a day after he caused a row by warning that there was a “special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit without even a basic plan for how to actually enact it. Speaking after her meeting she said: “I’ve raised with President Tusk the language that he used yesterday which was not helpful and caused widespread dismay in the UK.\u0026nbspThe point I made to him is that we should both be working to ensure we should deliver a close relationship between the UK and EU in the future and that’s what he should be focusing on.”Speaking on her way back to London, she added: “I’ve had a good series of meetings today. We’ve had robust discussions but they’ve been constructive.\u0026nbsp“What I’ve set out is our clear position: that we must secure legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement to deal with the concerns that parliament has over the backstop. Taking that: changes with the backstop, together with the other work we’re doing on workers’ rights and other issues, will deliver a stable majority in parliament. That’s what I’ve continued to push for.”Mr Tusk said there was “still no breakthrough in sight” and that “talks will continue”.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Countries are being asked to sign up blind,” said Liz May, the charity’s head of policy.Labour want new Brexit vote if May rejects our plan, McDonnell says“Without the full picture of how the EU and UK will trade in the future, it is impossible for countries to judge what these deals are really worth, how they will work in practice or even how some elements will be enforced.“Instead of acknowledging this difficulty, the government is relying on developing countries being compelled to sign up at the last minute, rather than risk high tariffs being slapped on their key exports.“This type of bad-faith negotiating – using implicit threats to get countries ‘over the line’ – is not a great way to start the UK’s independent trade policy.”No developing country has gone public with criticism of the UK’s approach, but some are believed to have objected privately and displayed their unhappiness by refusing to re-sign the deals so far.In the Brexit poker game no one has a decent handMay facing resignations as Brussels sends her away empty-handedJacob Rees-Mogg invited to strip naked for Brexit debateNo-deal fears over medicine supplies spark rush for UK-supplied drugsCrucially, food products, particularly bananas, sugar and beef, have among the highest tariffs if a country must trade on WTO rules, without a preferential deal.Mr Fox himself acknowledged the risk to developing countries from Brexit after his own department floated a proposal to abolish all tariffs if the UK crashes out of the EU, to avoid soaring inflation.He told a committee of MPs it would “erode preferences for developing countries, because they would lose the ability to take the advantage that is conferred by lower tariffs”.The “threats” are the latest controversy to erupt over the failure to secure the deals – worth 12 per cent of the UK’s total trade – with the clock ticking down to Brexit day.The focus has been on the danger of higher prices for British shoppers, and job losses in this country, but Traidcraft said the implications were potentially more severe for developing nations with deals.Richer countries, including Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Japan and South Korea, have the power to withstand pressure – and even push for better terms than exist\u0026nbspwith the EU.But, says Traidcraft, the poorest countries are vulnerable to the “sign up or lose\u0026nbspit” approach from London.A spokesperson for the Department for International Trade, said: “We take seriously our commitment to reduce poverty through trade and our top priority is providing continuity for our existing trading arrangements as we leave the European Union. \u0026nbsp“All developing countries that have economic partnership agreements with the UK have said they want to maintain their existing arrangements after we leave the EU and we have already signed a continuity agreement with eastern and southern African countries. We also intend to introduce a trade preference scheme that will benefit around 70 developing countries.”Ms May called for the UK to remove the pressure by offering one-way full-market access\u0026nbspon a temporary basis\u0026nbspuntil deals to help development could be agreed “in an orderly manner”.The UK was also unable to say which organisations would regulate health and safety of products\u0026nbspand standards\u0026nbsp“because some of this thinking simply hasn’t been done yet”, she added.If the Commons eventually passes the Brexit deal, it includes a 21-month transition period during which existing terms would continue to apply – but a crash-out would tear up the deals on 29 March.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereDepartment for International TradeOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I can be totally funded by oil and gas, by big pharma, and there’s no limit to that whatsoever.”The congresswoman, who represents New York’s 14th district, then noted how a corrupt legislator could even buy stocks in a\u0026nbspcompany, then write laws deregulating that industry, causing the share price to soar and pocket a huge profit.“You could do that,” confirmed one of the officials, adding that even the minor ethics regulations which did apply to members of Congress did not affect the president.“So I and every member of this body are being held to a higher ethical standard than the president of the United States,” Ms Ocasio-Cortez concluded.“It’s already super legal as we have seen for me to be a pretty bad guy. So it’s even easier for the president to be one.”Ms Ocasio-Cortez won her seat in congress by unseating long-time Democrat elder statesmen Joe Crowley, who outspent her in the primary campaign 18 to 1.Almost 75 per cent of her campaign funding came from small inidual donations, compared to just 1 per cent for Mr Crowley, who was mostly funded by larger businesses.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But Chinese investment has followed a more\u0026nbsppragmatic pattern, and is largely repayable in oil. The Russian bet, which includes military deals and\u0026nbspcontroversial, discounted\u0026nbspstakes\u0026nbspin oil fields, is\u0026nbspmore vulnerable to politics.\u0026nbspThe opposition-controlled National Assembly has, for example, called for some of the most recent oil deals with Russia’s Rosneft to be revisited. The reported appearance of Russian mercenaries at oil installations seems to be a direct response to these threats.\u0026nbspMaduro blockades bridge to stop humanitarian aid entering VenezuelaCentre-left leaders are uniting against Maduro – it’s time for changeDmitry Rosenthal, a Latin American expert at the Russian Academy of Sciences, told The Independent he believed Moscow could reach compromise with whatever government is in power. Backchannels were already likely in play, he says. But\u0026nbsp“unease” about the opposition’s rhetoric remained. \u0026nbsp“The Kremlin has been much more supportive of Maduro’s regime than the maximally pragmatic China, which has engaged with the opposition to a much greater extent,” he said. “Unsurprisingly, it sees Maduro as a much more reliable partner when it comes to\u0026nbspprotecting its interests.”As with other matters of foreign policy, Vladimir Putin is said to be\u0026nbsptaking a leading\u0026nbsprole in formulating the Russian response to the crisis. There have been few clues as to the president’s thinking. But on\u0026nbspWednesday, Bloomberg claimed some insight by quoting two Kremlin sources, both expressing doubt about the viability of Maduro’s regime.\u0026nbspThe report was quickly dismissed by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Yet voices in the outer circle of Russia’s foreign policy community\u0026nbspin parliament and the foreign ministry\u0026nbsphave toned down earlier, more categorical statements of support.\u0026nbspVladimir Dzhabarov, deputy chair\u0026nbspof the international affairs committee of Russia’s upper house, told The Independent that while Russia would not “walk back” its support of Maduro, it accepted its ally faced a battle to survive.\u0026nbsp“Russia has never hidden its recognition of Maduro as the country’s only legitimate president,” he said. “We understand he has led a flawed government and didn’t get everything right in the\u0026nbspeconomy or the social arena. But is it really worth taking\u0026nbspcountry to revolution or collapse? We don’t think so.”\u0026nbspMr Dzhabarov said Venezuela’s future could only be resolved around the negotiation table, but said the Guaidó opposition was “unwilling” to enter talks. “Half of Venezuela” still supported the Maduro regime, he said, and could be provoked to take to the streets if their man was toppled.\u0026nbspFyodor Lukyanov, a foreign expert considered close to the policy elite, also suggested Russia held little hope for the survival of the Maduro regime. But it could continue, he said, for as long as it had the army on its side,\u0026nbspwhich “might be much longer than people think”.\u0026nbspAs toxic as things might get with Maduro, what Moscow would not do is convert its support to\u0026nbspGuaidó, who was\u0026nbsp“an American puppet”.“As terrible a president as Maduro is, he’s loyal and he’s a partner,” said Lukyanov. “For Russia that is important.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her squabbling party has called a temporary truce. And nobody, including the EU, wants Jeremy Corbyn to take control.Even Labour MPs are rallying behind her — at a price. And working-class voters have given the Tories a healthy seven-point lead. They might even win a snap election.Played skilfully, this could win a deal that satisfies both Remainers and Leavers.Yet there are fears Mrs May will use it to revive her wretched Chequers plan, which sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis, or the botched deal thrown out last month by a -vote margin.She has made a worrying start by apparently binning the No Deal card — the only one that truly scares the EU. Mrs May has no intention of playing this ace — and never had.There are other worrying signs.This showdown with EU hardliners requires fresh thinking and shrewd advice from seasoned players. Crawford Falconer, an ex-World Trade Organisation ambassador, was recruited by the Brexit department for precisely these skills.Indeed, he is the ONLY person in the Government machine who has ever negotiated a trade deal.Yet bafflingly, Mrs May is keeping this star player on the sidelines.Instead, she will fly to Brussels with Whitehall mandarin Olly Robbins, the pro-EU fanatic who plunged Britain into the backstop trap she is now under pressure to escape from.Robbins hates Brexit and has privately warned the PM this is Mission Impossible.Mrs May — herself a Remainer who has never grasped the case for Brexit — will be joined by trusted “deputy PM” David Lidington, a dyed-in-the-wool Brussels worshipper.In such company, even the inclusion in her team of a thundering Brexiteer Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox is only mildly reassuring.Mrs May is notoriously stubborn. She can also be devious.After nearly three years, even her closest political colleagues — who can be counted on one hand with a couple of missing digits — have no idea what her Brexit might look like.Voters are increasingly irritated by this foot-dragging.Why should we remain part of an organisation that wants to punish us by stealing Gibraltar, Northern Ireland and our car industry Nobody who watched the brutal humiliation of poor little Greece will be surprised. This tragic and insolvent nation should never have been admitted to the EU, still less the Eurozone.Only with the assistance of US banking giant Goldman Sachs — “The Vampire Squid” — got them in under the wire. Once inside, they launched a borrowing and spending binge which ended in tears in the  crash.Greece might have flourished as a cheap but lovely tourist economy. Instead, it is now being cruelly tormented by Brussels and lumbered with multi-billion euros debts it can never repay.Greece symbolises all that is wrong with arrogant Brussels — the catastrophic Euro, inflexible economic policies and mass unemployment for under-s.Above all, there is the sneering contempt of unsackable Eurocrats for the million people they rule from subsidised ivory towers.Theresa May is a poor negotiator who never truly believed No Deal is better than a bad deal.Without this implicit threat, Brussels will give little and demand much in . It would be a pleasure to eat my words and watch Mrs May play a blinder.She can use her good luck to land a historic victory. Or she can blink and condemn Britain to colony status, paying billions more into EU coffers while being led by the nose on trade deal promises that never materialise.In which case, forget about that snap election fantasy.The Conservative Party would never be forgiven by the .million voters who voted Brexit — or those who wish they had.SECURITY CHIEFS are dusting off Cold War plans anticipating a Soviet nuclear strike to whisk the Queen to safety in the event of . . .  er . . . a No Deal Brexit.Presumably The Mall will be cleared of traffic and used as a landing strip to fly Her Maj out before revolutionary Remainers string her up for supporting Brexit.The only question is whether she will go quietly.The royals refused to leave London even after Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Second World War.This Project Fear nonsense is even more insane than the idea that thousands will die of fruit shortages.To quote Corporal Jones: “Don’t panic!!”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Do they not want Britain to succeed Do they not see that their bizarre, condescending attitude is EXACTLY why they lost in  THE rocketing suicide rate amongst teenagers is nothing short of a national crisis.And the solution MUST involve the social media firms who are profiting from youngsters’ suffering.They have been given quite enough warning that they are not doing enough to protect vulnerable kids.They have said for years that they just need a bit more time, and that they’d fix the problem themselves.Well, they’ve failed.Government has no choice but to step in – and it needs a concerted effort from the Education, Health and Culture Departments.One more tragic death is one too many.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s the wild exaggerations of Project Fear II about No Deal anarchy.It’s the Remainer MPs who voted to trigger Article , then lied to voters about respecting the referendum result even as they plotted to reverse it.It’s the brass-necked Tory MP who claimed “Brexiteers were lying when they said Nissan was going nowhere” — long after it was clear the war on diesel was really to blame for the U-turn on the new model in Sunderland.Next to all that, an over-optimistic prediction or two and a slightly inaccurate bus slogan look small beer.Lies  Remain ultras should look in the mirror.TO Corbyn’s disgust, the Government has recognised a new leader in Venezuela instead of the hard-left loon Maduro who has let millions starve.What’s Jezza’s alternative  Do nothing. Leave them to whatever grim fate awaits.Why  Because any Western intervention, even the aid they now desperately need, will prove that his lelong ideology has failed catastrophically. Again.His cult know it too. So they have a new tactic: Pretend they were never cheerleaders for the political system that has destroyed a once-rich country.It is a pack of lies.For years they touted Venezuela as their economic and social dream.They’re on the wrong side of history. They must not be allowed to dodge blame by rewriting their own.WHAT possessed Tory chairman Brandon Lewis to hound a woman over a porn snap she allegedly “liked” on Twitter His every focus should be on raising funds and attracting new blood to a party whose flagging membership has an average age in the late s.Instead he foolishly thinks there’s political advantage in shaming a Labour candidate over a smutty pic. Who cares Lewis has come a cropper before with hasty tweets. Like his demand for fellow Tory Boris Johnson to apologise over burka remarks most of Britain backed.But he’s just one of too many MPs who waste endless hours on Twitter, reducing politics to vacuous virtue-signalling or spiteful, tribal, juvenile point-scoring.No wonder voters are sick of them.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Real friends don’t nick £billion off you.There are two things worth knowing about Donald Tusk.

Communism wasa ­stinking and ruinous creed.Decent Poles bravely reasserted their national sovereignty after too many decades of being governed by ideological bureaucrats who couldn’t give a fig about the electorate.Er, remind you of anything, Mister ­Eurocrat That colourful background in the Gdansk of the s and s made it all the odder when, in , Tusk quit the premiership of his country to become an EU grand fromage.He had been Poland’s PM for seven years and the country had done well.Yet he chucked that in so that he could succeed shrivelling nonentity ­Herman Van Rompuy as president of the European Council.The job is less important than it sounds. Its occupant basically acts as a collector of opinions from EU heads of government and acts as their representative at ­international shindigs.That it was held by such a blinky-eyed vole as Van Rompuy was a measure of its signicance. Yet Tusk chucked in the prime ministership of his country for it!Brussels may offer wonderful pensions, top-trough brasseries and as many rides in the back of a BMW  Series as you could wish, but had Tusk gone mad The answer to that question is “not ­necessarily”. He saw that under EU rules, national governments are now increasingly junior to the federal superpower.The real power in Brussels lies not with Tusk, nor even with boozy European ­Commission president Jean-Claude ­Juncker, but with the backroom officials such as Martin Selmayr and Sabine ­Weyand. Both of them, you may notice, are ­German. This sht in powers has ­happened slowly over decades and ­electorates have taken a while to notice.But now the voters are copping on and are at last making their ­displeasure plain.The British Leave vote was the firstgreat expression of that anger.All of which helps to explain why ­unelected EU officials have been so ­spittingly angry with the British public for voting Leave. We have busted the dam.That is why Tusk snarled at us on Wednesday. He and his sort feel badly threatened by Brexit.They feel understandably insecure about the future of the federal EU project.The Tusks of this world regard the ­peoples of Europe as an inconvenience.They were appalled with David Cameron for letting the referendum happen and they are now appalled with our MPs for not stopping Brexit.Shortly before his “hell” remark on Wednesday, Tusk expressed his disbelief that Theresa May was insisting on ­pressing ahead with Brexit, and his ­disappointment that Remainers at ­Westminster had not succeeded in blocking our departure from the EU.At that point I must confess I shouted something rude at the television in my office. “It’s because we had a f***ing ­referendum and we voted to leave!” I cried.Shouting at a TV set: Uh-oh, I may have been driven as mad by Brexit as dotty Tory Europhile Anna Soubry. Tusk’s ­outburst was similar. Everyone’s losing it!The teenage Donald Tusk — the one who used to tour the streets of Gdansk with his gang — would, I think, have ­understood. I am not recommending ­violence but politically this is certainly a time we could all do with clenching our knuckles and looking out for our interests.Cruising for a bruising, a young lad in Gdansk might once have said.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary.Intimate details of the couples affair were first published in the Enquirer last month - just hours after Bezos announced he and his we MacKenzie were getting a orce.But in a sensational statement released yesterday, Bezos - the worlds richest man - said the magazines publishers AMI had attempted a campaign of extortion and blackmail against him.He claimed an editor acting on the orders of AMIs ferocious chairman David Pecker had gone on to demand Bezos stop his investigation into the text and photo leak, or  the nude pics would be published.Emails apparently sent by AMI chief content officer Dylan Howard to Bezos lawyer threatened the publication of  shocking snippets:After listing the descriptions, Howard allegedly wrote: It would give no editor pleasure to send this email.I hope common sense can prevail - and quickly.Explaining his decision to publish the emails alleging the blackmail, Bezos wrote on Medium: Any personal embarrassment AMI could cause me takes a back seat because there’s a much more important matter involved here.If in my position I can’t stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can According to further emails, AMI wanted Bezos assurance that he would end a probe into how the leaks first emerged last month.The billionaire alleges that his investigation could expose a pro-Trump political motivation being behind the Enquirers coverage.It is believed that the brother of former TV news anchor Sanchez may have gained access to the couples private messages.Ms Sanchezs brother Michael - thought to be a Trump supporter - is then alleged to have potentially passed the texts and pics on to the National Enquirer to discredit Bezos.President Trump has often vocally criticised Bezos - who also owns the Washington Post newspaper.And AMI has admitted that it engaged in whats known as catch-and-kill practices to help Trump become president.That admission was part of a deal between AMI and federal prosecutors.They agreed to not pursue charges against the company for secretly assisting Trumps campaign by paying , to a Playboy model for the rights to her story about an alleged affair with the then-candidate.The company then intentionally suppressed the story until after the election.Explaining his decision to speak out, Mr Bezos said: Of course I don’t want personal photos published, but I also won’t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks and corruption.I prefer to stand up, roll this log over and see what crawls out.”Publishing the shocking emails, Bezos added: Nothing I might write here could tell the National Enquirer story as eloquently as their own words below.AMI, also known as American Media Inc, has not commented on the allegations.Responding to previous allegations of political motivations affecting coverage, AMI said: “American Media emphatically rejects any assertion that its reporting was instigated, dictated or influenced in any manner by external forces, political or otherwise.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000467401312.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pawel relowicz mum innocent libby squire disappearance","story":"Meat factory worker Pawel Relowicz, , was arrested by cops on suspicion of abducting the Hull student more than a week ago.His tearful mum Marzena, speaking from her home in Poland, told The Sun: “There is no way it could have been him.“He bakes cakes, is a religious boy and is scared of blood and violence.“I am % he will be released.”Locals in Warszewice, northern Poland, where Pawel grew up before coming to the UK five years ago, said he did not have a criminal record in the country.Friends said he last ed to Poland with his we and two children around a year ago.His snowy home village is around  miles north of Polish capital Warsaw.Some  people live there and most work in a nearby sugar beet factory.Pawels mother Marzena, speaking to The Sun inside her detached home, said: “I have a feeling Libby is alive somewhere.“I would give my le for her now to reappear safe and well and for this nightmare to come to an end.“It just does not make sense because Pawel hates violence and blood -

The car then drives up the street and out of view.A second film, obtained by The Sun from a shopkeeper, shows a similar car being driven along Newland Avenue, half a mile away,  minutes later, at .am.It shows a police car patrolling the same road  seconds before.Cops yesterday quizzed Polish butcher Pawel Relowicz, , over the two pieces of footage after they were granted a -hour extension to quiz him on abduction claims.Detectives will want to investigate whether the car in the footage is the Vauxhall Astra seized from suspect Relowicz.They obtained the CCTV last Sunday but kept it under wraps as they frantically pieced together the car’s movements before and after Libby disappeared.The Sun was aware of the crucial development before the arrest but agreed not to publish details.Shop owner and dad-of-two Mohammed Burhan, , told how his cameras picked up a car driving along Newlands Avenue the night Libby vanished.He told The Sun: “The police have been into all of the shops along here asking for CCTV footage over a particular timeframe.“They came into my shop and have taken the video from three of my cameras.“I hope my CCTV can in some way help the police find Libby and discover what has happened.”Libby was seen on the bench close to her home on Wellesley Avenue at .pm last Thursday.The Haworth Street footage was captured by cameras overlooking steel gates to an electrical firm.Staff checked it after Libby was reported missing and alerted cops.But workers there are fuming detectives took so long to reveal it.One said: “We couldn’t understand why it wasn’t published straight away by the police.“If it was my daughter I would have it everywhere.“Surely they have had enough time to examine it, obtain the licence plate and do checks to find out where it went.Time is of the essence. They always talk about the golden hour in investigations. They’ve had nearly a week.”Libby vanished after a night out with pals on Thursday January .They were turned away from a club because she was too drunk.Pals put her in a taxi to take her home and she was dropped off near her digs at around .pm.She was seen staggering in the street then sat on the bench a short time later. Police said the last time they can be sure she was in that area was .am.Cops swooped on the home that meat factory worker Relowicz shares with we Jagoda and their two kids at pm on Wednesday.Libby’s mum and dad, Lisa, , and Russ, , have travelled to Hull from their home in High Wycombe, Bucks.Senior cops insist they are still treating Libbys disappearance as a missing persons inquiry.Friends of Libby are praying for her . One, Rachel wrote: “Please just come home lib.”Another said: “I just want my best friend back.”Lisa has posted a heartfelt message on her Facebook, and changed her profile picture to one of Libby.She wrote: “One week without her”, with crying emojis.Lisa also thanked the public for their support. Pals have raised £, in less than a day for the family’s hotels and bills in Hull.Det Supt Matt Hutchinson yesterday confirmed police had been given extra time to quiz Relowicz.He said officers have viewed s of hours of CCTV footage.One line of inquiry is the possibility Relowicz was moonlighting as an unlicensed taxi driver.Lib Dem councillor Paul Drake-Davis said: “As long as police say there is hope we will keep that candle burning for Libby.”CCTV film captures a woman believed to be Libby Squire getting into a car — before being driven out of view.Footage taken just after midnight last Friday shows the vehicle already parked on Haworth Street in Hull.The driver s at .am, unlocks it and then sits facing out with the driver’s door open.He appears to roll a cigarette or type into a phone.A cyclist rides past and is followed seconds later by a car.After sitting for nearly three minutes the man stands up and walks away, locking the car.At .am the passenger side door is opened and a person believed to be Libby gets in.The man walks round the back of the car before getting into the driver’s seat and setting off.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are having letters saying what is Parliamentary democracy all about  I object to Bills going through undebated at second reading.People are muddling up the substance of the matter. You could virtue signal. We could do all of our law by emotion rather than by debate.The MP rose to notoriety last year when he intervened to block a bill outlawing upskirting - when men take photos up womens skirts.His Commons office was festooned with underwear in protest."},{"url":null,"title":"teacher john teti creepy texts teen pupil grooming fly to france","story":"John Teti, , tried to coax the -year-old to elope with him abroad to get hitched.And he reportedly told the girl he called his we by her name during sex.Teti is said to have tried to lure her into bed by offering her trips to McDonald’s and rides to school in Oakland Park, Florida.Another message apparently said: We should spend all summer together.”He also vaped alone with her in class and asked hershe would skip lessons so they could be together, police said.It was a pattern of behaviour aimed at grooming her for sex, a complaint document says.Teti told investigators he had a “special bond and relationship” with the student and confessed to sending her vulgar messages, cops said.Stunned parents of kids at Northeast High School said they were disgusted over the allegations.Mum Dianne Methven said: “I think its horric and I dont know what these teachers are thinking.“I just dont understand it and it makes my stomach turn. Im so sick of this.Technology tutor Teti has been charged with “being an authority figure soliciting or engaging in a romantic relationship.”He was said to have been reprimanded last October over contacting pupils via education app Remind Me.This written counselling by the schools administration was in regards to maintaining a professional and ethical distance with his students,” Broward Sherf’s deputy Timothy Metz wrote in the affidavit.But Teti circumvented administrative monitoring and suspicion by swapping mobile phone numbers with several of his students and communicating with them for the rest of term.Teti appeared to be grooming the girl, building her trust by, among other allegations,” the document says.He is said to have told the teen over the phone that he was worried about statutory rape charges and that it was legal in France to marry at the age of .“Shedoesn’t have to know, we can fly to France,” he allegedly said.Teti intensied his pursuit and would routinely send her sexually charged text messages, often late at night.In one text he drew a heart with her name in it, the affidavit said.He was also said to have messaged the girl the next day saying he tried to stalk her coming out of class, but could not find her.I think youre just avoiding me because youre afraid thatyoure near me for too long, you wont be able to control yourself and just going to attempt to start making out with me, Teti allegedly wrote.He also said she was in love with him, but you just dont want to admit it.”In another text - after the girl told Teti she was sexually deprived” - he suggested she use alternatives, the court document says.He also reportedly confessed his love for her and extended his arms to hug her in front of her pal in school.And she was “overwhelmed” when he found her address and sent her a package of snacks and notes.Teti was arrested after the girl’s dad accused him of being a paedophile when his other kids tipped him off abut the teacher’s texts.The teacher was said to have dismissed the accusation by claiming the messages were “a joke.”And in a call recorded by her father he “discussed the size of his penis and lack of stamina during sex,” reports Local  News.An education spokeswoman said Teti was sacked and escorted from school by police."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000467486016.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may brexit irish pm leo varadakar dublin backstop","story":"The Prime Minister is this evening jetting to Dublin for a dinner date with the Taoiseach after her trip to Brussels yesterday.Shes expected to ask him for help in changing the Irish backstop plan which is preventing her Brexit deal being approved by MPs.But speaking on a trip to Belfast this afternoon, Mr Varadkar insisted Mrs May wont be able to drive a wedge between Brussels and the Irish government.He said: I am the EU when it comes to this matter.The Irish government and the EU are all one when it comes to Brexit and Im sure people,they havent realised that over the past two years, theyre coming to realise it.The decision that weve made as an EU is that the withdrawal agreement and the backstop are not up for negotiation but we can talk about the joint Political Declaration and what changes might be made to that.He added: Today is not a day for negotiations, today is a day for us to share our perspectives and for us to listen to each other.I believe ultimately we are going to have to get this deal over the line and I am determined to do that, and I think any engagement with the British Prime Minister and her team is useful.During his visit to Belfast, Mr Varadkar met with Northern Irish politicians including the DUP.Unionist boss Arlene Foster said they had had a positive meeting and rubbished claims that Brexit may have to be delayed.Tonight Mrs May will tell Mr Varadkar that after last weeks Commons vote approving the deal as long as the backstop is fixed, a legally binding change is the only way to avoid No Deal.She will be accompanied by Attorney Geoffrey Cox, seen as a key figure because of his influence with Brexiteers who need to be assured that any fix is legally sound.Mr Varadkar is coming under increasing pressure to sign off on changes to the backstop, which is designed to avoid a hard border.Brexiteers say the backstop in its current form risks leaving Britain trapped in the EUs customs union indefinitely.Angela Merkel is understood to be lobbying Dublin not to block a legally binding fix to the proposal.But Mr Varadkar is also under pressure at home - as a new poll finds four-fths of Irish voters want him to hold firm.Hes likely to be crucial to the process because EU leaders are wary of approving any Brexit deal that doesnt command support in Ireland.Yesterday Mrs May held frosty talks with European leaders Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk.It came after Mr Tusk said theres a special place in hell for the politicians who led the Brexit campaign.But the PM won a breakthrough as the EU agreed to restart talks on the deal with the aim of fixing the backstop.Mrs Merkel said yesterday: I think we can find solutions without re-opening the withdrawal agreement.Hardline Brexiteers insist they wont back the withdrawal agreement unless the backstop is removed entirely.But Mrs May is confident she can win over enough MPs to pass a deal by providing legally binding assurances that the backstop wont be in place permanentlyit ever does come into effect.Jeremy Corbyn this week launched a bid to force a soft Brexit, pledging to back Mrs Mays dealshe signs Britain up to the customs union."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000467229477.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit delay local election wipe out","story":"The ongoing deadlock with the EU has led many to expect the Article  exit talks will have to be extended beyond the March  deadline.But local government bosses and Cabinet ministers have warned No as well as the Tory party’s chairman that its vote at the council polls on May  will be decimatedthey are seen to have broken the key Brexit promise.That gives the PM just a five week extra window to wrap up Brexit and pass all necessary new laws, and  weeks in total from now.The Conservatives most senior councillor, Lord Porter – who chairs the Local Government Association, told The Sun: “If we’re not out by the time of the elections, we’re going to get kicked.It won’t be good for us.“It will also hit turnout, as people will be put off politics altogether.“Brandon Lewis has been made very aware of this.”A Cabinet minister also warned about the dire consequences of delaying Brexit beyond July , which would mean the UK would almost certainly be forced to hold fresh MEP elections along with the rest of Europe.The senior minister told The Sun: “The new European Parliament takes it seats on July , sowe’re not out by then we’ll have to blow £m on holding new elections here for it.“Our councillors are telling us that voters would punish us hard at the ballot box in May for this.So extending that long is untenable.”During meetings in Brussels on Thursday, it emerged Mrs May told EU chiefs she would not ask to extend Article , despite the fast approaching exit deadline.This year’s local elections are being held almost everywhere across England, outside of London.A total of  English local councils are up for grabs, as well as six directly elected mayors in England, and all  local councils in Northern Ireland.Almost all were last contested in  on the same day as the General Election, which David Cameron’s Tories won.Successor LordKerslake said Britain is heading for years of wrangling with Brussels.The new warnings came as former top mandarin Lord O’Donnell became the latest senior figure to urge the Brexit deadline be extended.The former Cabinet Secretary to three Prime Ministers between  and  wrote in the Evening Standard: “Are we going to follow a Norwegian model or one from Singapore, Turkey, Switzerland or Albania “The truth is we do not know and it is, I am afraid to say, irresponsible for any government to even contemplate embarking on such a perilous journey as Brexit without giving us a clearer idea of the eventual destination.”Next week the Commons could back a motion drawn up by senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper to delay Britain’s leaving datewe’re heading for No Deal.But evenMPs do vote for the controversial amendment, every single EU country would have the right to veto it.French officials have warned that they won’t approve a delay unless the UK has a coherent plan to use the extra time.A source told Reuters: “Fundamentally, we oppose an extension without a plan. That’s clear. We won’t accept it.”The official added that a delay would only be acceptableBritain wanted time “to build a new political solution”.Where are the radical plans to sort the housing crisis, or soaring crime  Or to lower taxes, as Tories always should New NHS cash aside, what can Theresa May’s Government boast about after nearly three years of Brexit paralysis Its unhinged war on our sugar intake Its scandalous suffocation at birth of the fracking industry  Sneaking through new taxes on the dead The Tories need a brand new offer to voters, and fast.

Personally, I didn’t.What I hope we’re all agreed on, though, is the fact that Danny’s too busy playing Danny Dyer, the professional geezer, to be a good listener or natural TV historian.It’s an act that worked, of course, when he was wondering, “Eleanor of Aquitaine, was she a looker ” but didn’t serve him so well when presented with a longbow.“Long, innit ”The Beeb clocked this before production started, obviously, so had paired him up with dozens of head-patting historians and actors who got him to dress up as every kind of medieval t**t you can imagine. Like Mr Benn on crack, it was.Armour, codpieces, nappies, tights, doublet and hose, and a gigantic white smock, bleached with human urine, which had one grovelling “courtier” wondering: “Has all the p*** been washed out, my Lord King ”A good question.We didn’t actually get the answer, though, until part two, on Wednesday, when, after a brief detour round his ancestors, Louis IX of France, William the Conqueror and Henry II, viewers got to the nub of things, with Professor Chris Given-Wilson explaining the agonising death of Edward II: “By thrusting a hollow instrument, like the end of a trumpet, up his fundament.”“’Old on a minute,” said a rattled Danny. “He’s been stabbed  With a trumpet ”“Into his fundament.” Long pause.“Don’t tell me it’s up his a**e ”Right up it, Danny, with a red-hot poker. News which didn’t just do his “nut in”, it seemed to derail the entire documentary.They ran out of direct royal ancestors shortly afterwards as well, and the BBC adopted its stupid default setting in such circumstances. It turned Danny’s Right Royal Family into a dance and cookery show, complete with demonstrations of both, from medieval experts.It was about this time I also sussed out what was going on in the background, with all those winsome historians. An audition.The BBC was using it to find its new face of history, though why any of the blokes turned up is a mystery. Auntie’s already made it clear: “The days of white, middle-aged men explaining stuff are over.”Danny, on the other hand, can be tolerated, because he’s their new performing Cockney. A novelty act who can be dressed up and patronised so much he ended this one doing some weird medieval can-can, with his family, in front of his lost ancestral pile.A trumpet wasn’t quite shoved up his fundament as they danced, but the p*** had very much been washed out of him, my Lord King.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month. “I think it’s going to be a really great show.” Cheryl Tweedy, The Greatest Dancer.“We do TV shows and we’re national treasures.” Jedward, Celebrity Coach Trip.“People will remember my name and I love that.” Some t**t off Ship- wrecked.IF you’re to take anything from the news experts have claimed Monday, January  was the most depressing day of the year, it’s probably the fact the experts clearly never sat through what happened eight days later, on Tuesday, January .Britain’s Top  Dogs Live: . All two-and-a-half yapping hours of it, on ITV, with a bad hangover, in the company of presenters Ben Fogle and Sara Cox.A test beyond personal endurance not because of the alcohol or dogs, who are a largely blameless lot, but the presence of their barmy owners, who attribute all sorts of superpowers to their dumb little mutts and blur the human animal relationship way beyond the point of reason and sometimes even good taste.Hits Radio DJ Gemma Atkinson, for instance, claimed: “I wouldn’t be where I am today without Norman”, her pet sproodle.Which is a hell of a guilt trip to pin on any dog.While Spandau Ballet’s Martin Kemp was seen, sitting alongside Popsie the poodle and his Wham! backing-singer we Shirlie, exclaiming: “I’ll say this for her,she does do a poo she goes into the spare bathroom.”The least you’d expect, frankly, after  years of marriage.The case study that really finished me off, though, was a dog dancing instructor called Joan Clark and her powder puff hounds, whose act, as described by Sara Cox, was: “All building up to the big finish. Can she pull it off  Joan points to the spot and it’s one, two, three pups between her legs.”CHANNEL ’s Pure is a comedy drama about a woman who suffers from the sixth sense of seeing naked people and is so tormented by her condition she screams: “F***ing stop.

SNP backers were outraged after the man - named online as an ex-UKIP council candidate, Billy Mitchell - launched a tirade against the party on the show in Motherwell last night. They quickly said hed appeared on the show repeatedly wearing the same orange jacket - and even been called for multiple questions. Applicants to the Question Time audience are asked to spell out any previous times theyve been on the show. Guests must also reveal who they would be most likely to vote for in a General Election, how they voted in the EU referendum, and whether they are a member of a political party. BBC sources admitted there was no hard and fast cap on the number of times someone can appear in the audience.   But they insisted they try to allow as many people as possible to join the programme and select audiences who are local and have a broad range of views. A BBC spokesperson said tonight: “We are investigating this issue.” The man was selected from the audience to speak, and accused the SNP of being hypocritical in criticising Theresa May and the Conservative Partys handling of Brexit . He criticised  member Fiona Hyslop, SNP Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs over Brexit. Launching a tirade against the MSP for Linlithgow said: What are you criticising Brexit about  You are so guilty, hypocritical about the indyref - there was no deal. You had no deal, you had no currency, you told us oil was going to be a million pound a barrel. Now you can get a barrel for a tenner down the Barras. No deal, no plan, absolutely useless.  Former SNP MP John Nicolson complained it was a recurring troll who had been invited on again. I get it that he sneaked back once, maybe twice. But again  he complained. I know it’s tough to screen the audience with a small team. But there’s something awry with audience booking that he keeps getting through screening. He’s a politician masquerading as a punter. Facebook user Peter Clive said: They should just stick him on the  the next time theyre in Scotland: hes practically the Scottish Farage now, thanks to the exposure they give him. Twitter users also questioned the former UKIP candidates reappearance on the show. User Eileeneileen said: His incoherent rant shouldn’t have been allowed to go on for as long as it did. While Burdynumnum wrote on Twitter: He’s been on three times, had his question picked each time and been tweeted by a BBC twitter account. Now what are the chances  Asked for comment by the Mirror, Mr Mitchell said: “A politician  Erm no Im a normal member of the public whos opinion doesnt match the mob,I was for SNP they would love me and you wouldnt be asking me why I gave an opinion that dfers. Im not linked or member of any political party nor am I a member of the Orange Order or flute band peoples imaginations love to run wild when they want to destroy your character.” Asked how many times he’d been on Question Time he said: “Haha now that is a story. No comment Im enjoying seeing all the folk argue with each other and all the wild assumptions. But it will be the last that I can tell you.” He added: “Listen I’m just a normal person interested in politics but because I dont support independence Im evil its not true I just dont think its good for Scotland.” "},{"url":null,"title":"christopher chope branded appalling tory","story":"NewsChristopher Chope branded a disgrace as Tory MP blocks progress of anti-FGM lawThe law protecting young girls from Female Genital Mutilation remains on the back burner after the Tory MP shouted \"object\" - just like he did for an upskirting BillShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video christopher-chope-branded-appalling-tory-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Tory MP has been branded an disgrace and a dinosaur after holding up a law to protect young girls from Female Genital Mutilation. Sir Christopher Chope shouted object to the law clearing a key hurdle without debate - the same tactic he used for a law against upskirting last year. He was branded appalling by fellow Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, who had been steering the Children Act Bill through the Commons, as Tory chiefs faced calls to strip him of the party whip. Home Secretary Sajid Javid blasted: Very disappointed by this. FGM is child abuse. I am determined to stamp out this despicable and medieval practice. We will do all we can protect girls at risk. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted: Outraged Chris Chope has blocked the FGM safeguarding Bill in Parliament today. His actions are wrong, pure  simple.Dawn Butler, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities, said: Its unacceptable that this dinosaur of a Tory MP consistently gets away with blocking new laws which would protect the safety and rights of women.“This makes it even more shocking that he was given a knighthood by Theresa May last year.“Christopher Chope is causing shame and embarrassment on the Tories but also for the country and its time for the Tories to show they really care about these issues by stripping him of the whip. Furious anti-FGM campaigner Nimco Ali said he was an embarrassment to his party and humanity. She tweeted: He needs his whip and knighthood removed. The backbench Bill would make it easier for judges to step in and place child victims of the practice in care - taking them away from their parents.The Bill was fully approved by the House of Lords in November - but because it is not proposed by the government, receives only limited debating time in the Commons. Despite not being debated today, it could have passed its second reading without debateMPs had chosen to do so. It would have still been scrutinised by MPs in a y committee stage before ing for a final vote. But because Sir Christopher shouted object, it will remain on the back burner. It has next been listed for March  but could potentially be blocked then.   The MP previously faced a furious backlash when he shouted object to a law making upskirting a specic criminal offence. Anonymous Parliamentary workers adorned his office door with womens underwear and the law was eventually passed in another form after Cabinet ministers intervened. Sir Christopher has previously said he is not against the inidual laws, and is simply making the point that laws should not be passed without proper debate. But Mr Goldsmith today said he had only chosen to shout object to some laws - and not others by his friends.  Mr Goldsmith tweeted before the incident today: Today Chris Chope MP will once again use arcane procedure to block a Bill that would amend the  Children Act to include FGM on the list of thingsfor which the courts can issue protection ordersthey think a child is at risk. The Bill has been scrutinised fully in the Lords, and is supported now by Government. Chope has been begged not to block it by FGM campaigners.People ask why he would do such a thing - and indeed why he has similarly blocked motions to debate Hillsborough, pardon Alan Turing, ban the use of wild animals in circuses, target ‘upskirting’ and much much more besides.  His argument is that he simply wants Bills properly debated. But it is a pretence.If today’s Bill goes through, we will have Committee Stage, Report Stage and Third Reading – all of which involve scrutiny and debate. If it is blocked, there is no debate. Labour shadow culture minister Rosena Allin-Khan demanded Tory chairman Brandon Lewis reprimand the MP. Lib Dem MP Tom Brake said Sir Christopher had reached a new low, adding: Absolutely appalling behaviour. He is a disgrace to parliament, his constituency and women  children everywhere. Labour MP Luke Pollard added: Christopher Chope objects to an anti-FGM measure and brings the whole place into disrepute. How is he able to get away with this  Sir Christopher did not immediately respond to requests for comment by the Mirror. However, in tests to Ms Ali shown to BuzzFeed News he said: This should be fully debated.

If Mrs May and Jeremy Corbyn do not welcome the prospect of this new electoral threat, and would like me to retire from frontline politics, they have a very straightforward opportunity to keep themselves happy. All they have to do is deliver a proper Brexit – the one which . million people voted for in June .Otherwise, this threat will turn into a promise.   UKIP members worried by its drt could also flock to the new party. Many Brexiteers loyal to Mr Farage have snubbed his former party after English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson was appointed an adviser to latest leader Gerard Batten. Only two years ago UKIP were calling for Mr Farage to be knighted, hailing him as the man who allowed Brexit to happen. UKIP surged to million votes in the  general election before its support was cut drastically to around , in .  Mr Farage fell out dramatically with his own party after it took a sharp lurch further to the right under Mr Batten. But he has long been branded a hard-right figure himself. He prompted public revulsion when he said foreign HIV patients should not be treated on the NHS and paraded before the now-infamous Breaking Point poster, which was reported to police and compared to Nazi propaganda.

The three-year-olds mother Adrian Hoare and her boyfriend Stephen Waterson are on trial accused of child cruelty and manslaughter over Alfies death. He was crushed behind an Audi convertibles electric car seat on the way home from a shopping trip in Croydon, south London, on February  last year. The CCTV, today shown to a jury at the Old Bailey, shows three-foot Alfie with Hoare, , and her -year-old partner, the adopted son of former Tory minister Nigel Waterson. Cross-examining the mum, prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC said: Whose pace are you walking at  What allowances were you making for Alfies little legs  Why is Alfie having to run   The defendant replied: Its just the way I walk evenits just me and Alfie. Alfie always runs. Mr Atkinson QC went on: Until he got into that car on the way back from Sutton, he was fine wasnt he  And by the time that the car reached Adams Way he was very far from fine, wasnt he  Something had to have happened in that journey  So when doctors and police start saying something happened to Alfie, you knew it had to have happened in the car. Were you not thinking it must have been Stephen   Hoare, originally from Gravesend, Kent, replied: Not straight away. Mr Atkinson QC said: What Stephen had done with his seat he had done deliberately. He was annoyed the second time he moved his chair back  Hoare agreed, but added: To begin with I did not blame anyone for what happened. The lawyer said: Was it your relationship with Stephen was just too important  Wasnt the reality you just put what Stephen wanted first  The defendant denied this.  The trial had earlier heard how Waterson allegedly said: I will not be told what to do by a three-year-old, before allegedly crushing the boy. There were four adults in the car as well as two children who were forced to sit in the footwell at the time. Tana Adkin QC, defending Waterson, said his chair had nothing to do with the youngsters injuries. She suggested Hoare must have done something.  Hoare denies manslaughter, child cruelty and common assault on Emilie Williams, who was also in the car. Waterson, of Croydon, has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and intimidation of the driver Marcus Lamb. The couple and Williams have pleaded guilty to conspiring to pervert the course of justice by making  statements to police.

Twisted words, half-truths and outright lies are the weapons that have kept this country locked in a state of arrestedshy development for the past three years as all political energy has been spent on failing to deliver an imaginary freedom from invented tyrants.

Ruby - a Hungarian Vizsla - had cheekily stolen two brownies which contained Xylitol, a form of sweetener, which is toxic to dogs and can cause liver failure when consumed. Ruby fell ill within  hours leaving owner Kate Chacksfield, from Acton, West London, heartbroken.And despite spending pound, in a bid to save her le, Ruby died aged seven on October . Kate, , is now sharing her story to raise awareness for the dangers of dogs consuming natural sweeteners. The media and presentation coach said: I only made brownies with Xylitol in to reduce the amount of sugar I was eating. But while I was out, Ruby managed to get into the container off the side in the kitchen and eaten a couple.  She seemed fine at first and it wasnt until a couple of days later she began being violently ill and I took her to the vets. I had no idea how serious eating natural sweeteners was for dogs, the photos of her on le support still make me cry. Weve had her since she was a puppy and Im completely lost without her. Kate claims Ruby had stolen the chocolate brownies in the past and claims the vet had stated small amounts of chocolate arent too harmful to dogs her size. Following previous experiences - Kate wasnt too worried about Ruby this time until she began being sick. Kate said: Ruby began being violently sick so I rushed her to the vets so sent her home after checking her over.  But soon after she collapsed and we took her back as soon as possible - it was then they started treating her for rat poison because of her symptoms. We just thought she may have eaten some by mistake in the park or something - it never crossed my mind to mention the brownies. As Rubys condition began to deteriorate, she was taken to The Royal Veterinary College, London, but sadly died eight days later of liver failure and a suspected stroke. It wasnt until after Rubys death that vets askedshe may have consumed Xylitol which is when Kate realised her health deterioration was linked to the brownies. She said: I had absolutely no idea Xylitol was harmful to dogs what so ever and I was heartbroken when they told me and I knew it was too late for Ruby.  I really, really urge other dog owners to read up on the dangers of Xylitol in dogs and urgently take their pets to the vetthey accidentally consume it as it could be the dference between le and death. Xylitol sweetener can be found in many products such as sugar free sweets and gum, some baking mixes, peanut butters and chocolate. Kate says it takes just a quarter of a teaspoon to cause liver failure in dogs the size of a Labrador, and even less in smaller breeds. She said: We did everything we could to save Ruby - she was so loved and we all miss her dearly. We really had hope she would pull through so we were heartbroken when she didnt.  Wed love to be able to save other dogs from going through what Ruby went through by raising awareness on the dangers of Xylitol for dogs.

She and Pete Ames had only been dating for six months but both knew they had found “the one”. Then doctors said they were running out of ways to treat the blood cancer she’d been fighting for three years. And she would probably die within months. “I was told I was out of treatment options,” says Jo. “All the doctors could offer me was palliative care. “I pushed them for a timeframe and they told me it was unlikely I’d make it past Christmas. It was devastating. I wouldn’t reach my one-year anniversary with Pete.  “A few weeks later we were painting my bedroom and Pete burst into tears. He told me he didn’t want me to leave this world not being his we.” So the couple planned their big day in eight weeks and wed in an emotional ceremony surrounded by their family. Eight years on, there is about to be a new addition to the Kelly-Ames family – a daughter for Pete and Jo, both . Against near-impossible odds, Jo beat her terminal cancer after doctors fought for pioneering drugs that kept her alive long enough for a stem cell transplant. Blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan then found the only registered donor in the world who was a genetic match.   Now Jo and Pete – who had beaten testicular cancer before they met – will welcome their baby girl later this month. Jo says: “We feel so lucky to be shyplanning for a future we never thought we had. I wrote a thank-you letter to my donor but didn’t hear back. All I know is he was  and I think he had dark hair. Every time I read that letter I cry. “We will write when our daughter arrives. We owe him everything – I wouldn’t be here without him.” Jo, of Lichfield, Staffs, who works for the Arts Council, was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma at , after a large lump appeared on her neck. The disease can usually be cured with intensive chemotherapy and Jo gave up her job and moved in with her parents to focus on the treatment.  But she relapsed months later and over the next three years tried all shyavailable treatments. Nothing worked... Instead, the cancer spread to her lungs and bones. The pain was so severe Jo began suffering fits. She says: “When I was diagnosed, I felt like broken goods. I was a year out of university, embarking on my career and dating. I met Pete through a mutual friend, who told each of us what the other had been through. “We really clicked. He got everything. We knew this was something special. But our hopes were dashed when the doctors said they’d run out of options.” Pete proposed at his house, which he shydecorated with fairy lights. He even painted “I love you” on the walls in  languages. He quit his job in Birmingham to work for minimum wage in Manchester to be with Jo.  They hastily planned a wedding – finding an off-the-rack dress as they had no time to get one made. Jo says: “I was very frail, according to the doctors’ estimates I only had a month left. I had an IV drip I had to tape to the underside of my arm but it was an incredible day.” Pete says: “I’ve been to a lot of weddings but never one where there was so much love. Everyone was hugging each other.” Days before the wedding, Christie Cancer Hospital in Manchester told Jo her doctors had been given permission to give her a new drug, Brentuximab Vedotin, on compassionate grounds. It stopped the cancer progressing so well the NHS agreed to fund it for other patients, including  who went into remission and had le-saving stem cell transplants. Another drug Bendamustine, which is still not widely available on the NHS, sent Jo’s cancer into remission and she was able to have a transplant.  Jo says: “A year before my transplant we checked the donor register and there were no matches. By the time I was ready there was one. “We were terried he might not want to go through with it. We couldn’t speak to him directly but, thanks to Anthony Nolan, everything fell into place.” Jo spent a month in hospital during the London Olympics in  as her body was blasted with chemotherapy to wipe away the cancer, her bone marrow and her white blood cells to try to stop her body rejecting the transplant. Pete, a business consultant, says: “The worst moments were sitting at home after leaving Jo at the hospital, eating dinner at pm and thinking, ‘If the transplant doesn’t work, this is what’s left. Our bed felt so empty. There were a lot of tears.” The nightmare nearly became a reality... Jo says: “You are pushed very close to death during the transplant. You are being sustained by blood transfusions. There was one night where I felt something give way in my body. I hit rock bottom. I knewI chose, I could pass away quietly. But underneath that was another thought, ‘No, push through one more night.’ I had to keep trying for Pete and my parents. The next day my blood counts started to rise ever so slowly.” Recovery was tough. Jo suffered graft versus host disease, which can be fatal, as her body struggled to accept the transplant. It was  months before she was able toto regular work for the first time in five years. She took up track cycling and, after doctors gave her the all-clear, she ran the London Marathon on her rd birthday last April. The couple also discovered it might be possible for them to have a baby, despite Jo being left infertile by chemotherapy, as her womb was undamaged. They used Pete’s sperm and a donor egg but were left with just one embryo to implant. Jo says: “One of our friends said they thought it would work because we do pretty well when the odds are against us. “After years of having no future to plan for, we’re planning how to raise our daughter. She is the best gt – the gt of love we thought we’d never have.”Find out more about the Anthony Nolan charity at www.anthony nolan.org"},{"url":null,"title":"family demand action after girl","story":"NewsFamily demand action after girl, , found hanged in \"chaotic\" care psychiatric facilitySophie Bennett was found in a bathroom in Lancaster Lodge in Richmond, west LondonShareCommentsByTess de la Mare:,  FEB NewsSophie Bennett took her own le in May  \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe family of a teenager found hanged at a psychiatric care facility deemed chaotic and unsafe by inspectors have called for criminal charges. Sophie Bennett, , was found in a bathroom in Lancaster Lodge in Richmond, west London, in May  just over a year after she was admitted in April . She died two days later in Kingston Hospital as a result of her injuries. The teenager suffered from bipolar affective disorder, social anxiety disorder and atypical autism. Shortly before Ms Bennett died, the Care Quality Commission criticised the facility as inadequate in a number of areas. At an inquest, jurors were tasked with deciding whether changes at the facility run by charity Richmond Psychosocial Foundation Internationalcontributed to her death. The home had seen a number of staff changes and was in the hands of interim manager Duncan Lawrence.  West London Coroners Court heard Mr Lawrence did not have a legitimate medical doctorate, and had instead obtained a certicate from a degree mill in Denmark. Mr Lawrence failed to attend the inquest despite being summonsed. It also emerged that Ms Bennett had self-harmed in April  and said she was experiencing suicidal thoughts, but staff at Lancaster Lodge had ignored advice to admit her straight to hospital for an assessment.  Instead, they decided to keep her in the home under close observation, but allowed her to close the bathroom door on the day she was found hanged. CQC inspector Wynne Price-Rees found staff and patients were happy when he visited for a routine inspection in the previous September. But he discovered a totally dferent story in March, adding: I think it was chaotic. On the first day of the urgent four-day inspection, he said he found Mr Lawrence disengaged and lacking knowledge of essential care documents.  Hedidnt seem to have a grasp of the concepts that are fundamental, Mr Price-Rees added. The inspector said he had numerous concerns, including kitchen items not being locked away and poorly qualied junior staff. In their conclusion on Thursday, the jury found that the changes to care, inadequately trained staff and the fact that staff were in the deep end and learning on the job all contributed to Ms Bennetts death. The jury found that a grossly inadequate observation plan was put in place for Ms Bennett, and not understood or followed.  They also said staff were not properly trained in carrying out room searches and did not know what items they should be looking for. Ben Bennett, Ms Bennetts father, also raised concerns about Elly Jansen, who was acting as a consultant to the RPFI board. Mr Bennett described Ms Jansen as possessing an extraordinary approach to management, which was like something out of the th century. It emerged that Ms Jansen was forced to step away from a psychiatric charity in the s due to allegations of financial mismanagement and misappropriated funds. Lawyers for the Bennett family allege that while not a trustee, Ms Jansen was effectively the shadow director of RPFI and the controlling mind, making decisions on staffing and management at Lancaster Lodge.  The inquest revealed several other residents at Lancaster Lodge became very ill amid the disruptions in  and at least one attempted suicide . Friend and fellow patient Clarissa Jeffrey said the changes in  made it feel like the residents were running the house. The changes felt like they were fuelled by trying to ... save money rather than trying to help the people in the lodge, she said in a statement to the inquest. Sophie told her mother Nickie Bennett the new regime saw the place become like a boot camp with strict rules and exercise, the court heard.  In a statement, Sophies family said: Weve waited nearly three years to find the truth about what happened to our beautul daughter who, despite her many problems, had a fulfilling le ahead of her. We thank the jury for listening to the, at times, dficult evidence, and their clear conclusions which vindicate our concerns. The family said it hoped the CQC would pursue a criminal prosecution and criticised the Charity Commission for failing to attend the inquest. [The Charity Commission] has known about the issues surrounding the governance of RPFI since well before Sophies death. I hope that it will now apply the full force of its powers to take action against those trustees who have clearly been negligent in their responsibilities. On Friday, coroner John Taylor said he would now prepare a Prevention of Future Deathsreport to be submitted to the RPFI board, the CQC, Charity Commission and other interested parties to prevent future tragedies arising from poor care.

Their job was to dig graves and operate the crematorium for the people of Liverpool. But for  anxious days, they were on strike in the Winter of Discontent that paralysed the nation and cost Labour political power in . The gravediggers’ walkout was demonised in headlines like “Now They Won’t Let Us Bury Our Dead!”. Families were split and violence flared on Merseyside in the dispute – merely a microcosm of a national confrontation between Labour premier “Sunny Jim” Callaghan and the labour movement. Such was the furore that  years later, survivors of the industrial action cannot bring themselves to talk about it openly.   One man who can is Ian Lowes, , the gravediggers’ GMB convenor at the time and still a union activist. He defends the strike. “It was ‘enough is enough’ by low-paid workers who were treated like dogs.” But he promises: “Never again.” The diggers’ down-shovels was a long time coming.

At a secret meeting that autumn in his Sussex farmhouse, TUC leaders – among them David Basnett, leader of the cemetery workers’ union – warned him that, after years of wage restraint, they could not hold their members back.   Pay curbs were rejected at Labour’s annual conference, and the floodgates opened when striking Ford workers won a % pay rise. A tanker drivers’ walkout triggered a national fuel emergency before % increases were conceded. Public service unions swtly took up the cudgels and, on January , , staged a National Day of Action in support of a pound-a-week minimum wage, practically double the gravediggers’ money. In numbers, this was the biggest stoppage since the General Strike of . Eventually, the year lost ,, working days to stoppages. Stre came to Merseyside when GMB shop stewards representing , workers employed by Liverpool City Council met to plan a follow-up. “The national leaders had lost control,” says Ian. “So we decided to go for selective action, bringing out key workers and putting a financial levy on everybody . Binmen carried on working but we closed tips, so the rubbish piled up.”   In the Parks and Gardens department, eight crematorium workers and about  gravediggers were called out on a show of hands. This was the s, before Tory labour laws demanded pre-strike secret ballots. The walkout was solid. Pickets weren’t needed at the city’s big sites like Allerton Cemetery – where we’re speaking today – and the adjoining Springwood Crematorium. The levy meant the strikers enjoyed virtual take-home pay. It could have gone on indefinitely, like some of the walkouts by council workers that left London’s Leicester Square a mountain of uncollected refuse, and half the country’s hospitals on emergency admissions only as NHS manual workers joined the dispute.   Leaders of the Liberal-run city council begged the men to go back, the chief executive anticipating media malice with a plea, “Even in war they stop to bury the dead”. An irate GMB official came to Liverpool and ordered the men resume work, prompting a predictable Scouse raspberry. Hostility went off the Richter scale. Inevitably, Tory leader Margaret Thatcher condemned the walkout, sensing electoral opportunity. In the Commons, Anthony Steen, Tory MP for Liverpool Wavertree, called it “repugnant, an outrage to human decency” causing great personal distress to the bereaved. Some  bodies were awaiting burial or cremation, embalmed and stored in a disused factory in Speke, he told MPs. “This strike offends against the dignity of man, and is a horrying example of man’s indference and inhumanity to the dead,” he declared.  This was the MP later to find fame for claiming pound, expenses for his country home in Devon, where he moved after losing his Scouse seat. And a vicar shared this apocalyptic vision: “When gravediggers will allow corpses to mount up rather than carry out their duty, I detect the undermshyining of the whole structure of society.” Duty  For the men it was a job of work, carried out for -odd quid a week in all weathers, without protective clothing. They were not even allowed into the canteen for their break. A dumper truck came round with the tea and they ate their snap round an open hole. Ian insists: “This was all about a group of low-paid people fighting to try to get a better deal. They had a right to withdraw their labour but, when they did, the consequences were terrible.” As working-class men in communities, it was obvious strikers’ identities would be known. One was attacked in a pub and taken to AE, where it is said he was left for hours by NHS staff, even though they were in dispute, too. One whose mother died is still not speaking to the family. There were threatening letters and verbal abuse. In fact, I understand some cremations were secretly taking place at Springwood of bodies that could not be embalmed. They were held in the evening, by unpaid volunteers. In the second week of the walkout, they gathered to take stock. Enough really was enough – of the strike. The action was hurting ordinary people, not the government. They voted to go back after  tumultuous days in the eye of a media storm. Propaganda damage had done its worst in this corner of militancy, but the wider dispute did not end. Council workers struck, and unofficial strikes by ambulance staff and other public service workers continued until late February, when % pay rises were granted and Healey signed a peace treaty with the TUC. As a show of political unity, it was too little, too late. Jim Callaghan had ducked a general election in September . Labour was then five points in the lead in opinion polls, but by the end of the Winter of Discontent the Tories were  ahead. They were helped by complacent Callaghan, who ed from a conference in the sunny Caribbean and didn’t quite say to reporters at Heathrow, “Crisis, what crisis ” But the headlines did, and that’s what mattered in a nation on the cusp of radical political change. “Britain Isn’t Working” ads and TV broadcasts for the May election showed footage of rubbish piled in the streets, picketed hospitals and locked cemeteries. Swept into power on an anti-union ticket, Thatcher enacted laws that would have made the gravediggers’ dispute unlawful. Some say the unions dug their own grave. Does Ian, a one-time member of the hard-left Militant Tendency, think it could happen again  “In the last  years, this is the only time there has been a dispute in the cemeteries of Liverpool. There have been issues, but they have been resolved without strike action. My answer is no.” That might come as a relief to the  workers who still tend the city’s six cemeteries. And at least they can now sup tea in the canteen. One of the Class of  declined to talk to the Mirror, so these words may have to be the epitaph for the revolt of the Liverpool gravediggers.

Town hall leaders said it could mean “older people having a free bus pass but no bus to travel on”. Hundreds of thousands of people could lose the bus services they rely on as cash-strapped councils continue to be squeezed.  Local authority leaders are warning that almost half of bus routes are at risk of being scrapped. It stems from local authorities facing an annual poundmillion fundshying gap for the free bus pass scheme for disabled people and over-s. Councils in England say this shortfall means they cannot spend as much on the roughly , bus services they subsidise, putting them at risk. These subsidised routes make up % of the total number.

And for Thomas Markle, daughter Meghan was always his favourite child, who would always get whatever she asked for at Christmas, no matter how expensive.\u2028Family photos of the now Duchess of Sussex with her father, cuddling closely, playing and joking around, show just how close the two once were. \u2028But today the relationship between father and daughter couldn’t be more dferent - a toxic stew of outbursts, insults and public freeze-outs. \u2028It would be sad and destructive in any family but with Meghan it was inevitable that their increasingly bitter rt would be played out in front of billions around the world.   And wherever Meghan goes, the tensions with her father - as well as other family members - are never far from the surface.This week it emerged Meghan had written her father a letter after her wedding to Prince Harry to beg him to stop “victimising her”.Friends concerned that the “emotional trauma” of dealing with her dad could have a negative effect on her baby, told People magazine that Thomas responded with a long letter of his own, in which he asked his daughter for a photo shoot. So what went wrong to fracture a relationship that not so long ago was so close it was admired by all who knew them  Only four years ago Meghan described her father with love and affection as she spoke of the sacrices he made so she could chase her dream to be a performer.  Revealing their “special quote” as she paid tribute to him on Father’s Day, she said: “If I had all the water in the world, I’d give all the water to you…” And she has also described how the unconditional love of her father and his determination for her to fulfil her dreams made all the dference as she grew up in Los Angeles. Royal biographer Andrew Morton claims that Meghan was the favourite of his three children. He claims he would always make sure she got her preferred present at Christmas. And he described how half-sister Samantha “often told the story of the time before Christmas when Meghan was looking at a jewellery catalogue and picking out a ring, which Tom Senior promised as a gt. Browsing the pages of the pricey catalogue, Meghan teased her much older sister by saying that whatever her father bought [her half-sister Samantha], Meghan would receive the most expensive gt as she was the most favoured child. Meghan herslef once said: “It’s safe to say I have always been a daddy’s girl – he taught me how to fish, to appreciate Busby Berkeley films, write thank-you notes, and spend my weekends in Little Tokyo eating chicken teriyaki with vegetable tempura.”   She recalled how one Christmas he created a Barbie family for her when they were only sold in sets of white dolls or black dolls. Her new collection of dolls had “a black mom doll, a white dad doll, and a child in each colour. My dad had taken the sets apart and customised my family”. And when Meghan was confronted with a tick-box form to fill in at school about her ethnicity and found she did not fit into just one category, she revealed: “My dad said words that will stay with me forever: ‘Draw your own box.” Meghan also revealed how as she grew up he taught her the importance of kindness and along with her mother, Doria Ragland, they would buy turkeys for homeless shelters at Thanksgiving. They would deliver meals to patients in hospice care, donate spare change in their pocket to those asking for it, as well as offering a simple hug, smile or pat on the back to those who needed it. And she has described a doting father who was determined for her to lead a le of happiness and kindness where she could fulfil her aspirations.   Meghan has said previously: “He is the person who believed in this grand dream of mine well before I could even see it as a possibility.” And she once paid tribute to “the blood, sweat and tears this maninvested in my future so that I could grow up to have so much”. When aged  she told him she wanted to be a photographer, he dug out his tools and got to work transforming her bathroom into a darkroom where she could develop her snaps. He shaded the windows, as well as filling the cabinets with the chemicals she would need to produce the pictures. And he also took her to tap and ballet classes every Saturday morning despite him working + hours a week”.  He also regularly did the lighting for her high school musicals so that they felt as grand as a Broadway show. When he won ,on the lottery in , Thomas used part of it to pay for Meghans private school fees so she would have the best education. Her birth date was among the numbers that helped him win big when she was aged nine. Thomas, who now lives a quiet le in Mexico, worked a lightning director on shows such as hit sitcom Married…With Children and popular US drama General Hospital, for which he won two Emmys for his team’s work. It was while accompanying her father that a young Meghan got a taste of what le was like to be an actress.   She said in : “Every day after school for  years, I was on the set of Married…with Children, which is a really funny and perverse place for a little girl in a Catholic school unorm to grow up.” She described being surrounded by famous actors, multi-million dollar budgets, and crew lunches that always included filet mignon and enough sweets to make you think you were at Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. As she went from audition to audition trying to make it as an actress, it was Thomas who put petrol in her car so she could get to them. He also coached her how to handle herself on set, right up to her big break as Rachel Zane on the TV show, Suits. She said: He taught me to write thank you notes, to always arrive early, to drink Arnold Palmers, to find my light when I’m on camera…and beyond. And that, right there, is the point: my dad taught me to find my light. And he taught me to always make my own box.  Thomas has also spoken of their close bond, recently revealing letters and cards he received from his daughter over the years. One letter read: “Daddy, Because you have always been so generous with me and taken the best care of me it brings me so much joy to be able to give you this Christmas. I love you to no end. Meg.” A Valentine’s Day she sent him read: “Daddy … I don’t express as often as I should how much you mean to me. :Everything you do for me has turned me into who I am and I am so grateful. All I want to do is make you proud … and I promise, no matter what, I’ll do it.  Thank you for everything daddy. I love you with all of my heart now and forever. Love Bean”. Bean was Meghan’s childhood nickname. Thomas told the Daily Mail: “I loved getting cards from Meghan. “She wrote me hundreds of little cards and notes through the years. Sometimes they were for special occasions, other times just little notes she would leave around the house. I’ve still got a Post-It Note on my fridge which says, ‘I love you Daddy’”. Their close and loving relationship makes its breakdown since her wedding to Prince Harry in May last year even the more tragic and incomprehensible.Up until just a few days before the Royal Wedding, Thomas was planning on attending. He was due to meet the Queen and other members of the royal family, including his future son-in-law Prince Harry for the first time, before the wedding on Saturday. But then it emerged he was paid money from a photographer to stage pictures of him trying on suits and researching the royals before the wedding. Meghan, still eager on having her father attend, was still reportedly prepared to forgive the scandal.  But then he suffered a heart attack and had to undergo surgery ahead of the wedding, and decided not to go. And things just kept going went downhill from there. On theFriday before the wedding Thomas appeared on Good Morning Britain to explain why he was not attending. Then, talking to TMZ he said he had watched his daughter’s wedding from his hospital bed. He said: “My baby girl is a duchess and I love her so much. When you watch your child getting married, every thought goes through your mind, every memory from the first day she was born, the first time I held her.”  In another Good Morning Britain interview he claimed he made Prince Harry promise never to hit his daughter as a condition of securing his blessing for their marriage But confirmed that he still hadn’t met his son-in-law.And in an interview with The Sun , he said he hadn’t spoken to Meghan since a brief phone call after the wedding.He claimed he was worried he might die soon without patching things up with her. He said: I had a heart attack, doesnt anybody care  I could actually die soon.  Does she want this to be the last thing weve said to each other  It is probably the longest time I have gone without speaking to her ever. I just want to clear the air and tell her how proud I am of her. Thomas later also criticised the Royal Family, saying his daughter looked terried in her new role. He claimed: I see it in her eyes, I see it in her face and I see it in her smile. Ive seen her smile for years. I know her smile. I dont like the one Im seeing now. This one isnt even a stage smile — this is a pained smile.  Meghan and Harry were reportedly blindsided by the interviews Thomas continued to give to media and his daughter allegedly begged him to stop talking to the press. But instead his comments turned increasingly nasty and he turned his attacks on Meghan herself. Speaking to the Daily Mail for nearly nine hours over three days in July he described his daughter as “cold” and even suggested “it would be easier for MeghanI died”. He said: What riles me is Meghans sense of superiority. Shed be nothing without me. I made her the Duchess she is today. Everything that Meghan is, I made her. “I was... making good money, and could afford to give her the best, with a good school, good education, good home.  “She became the woman that she is today thanks to everything I did for her. And did I get any recognition for it  Any thanks  She doesnt even speak to me now. How cold is that  I tell you, Ive just about reached my limit on Meghan and the royal family. I’m about to unload on them. They want me to be silent, they want me to just go away. But I wont be silenced. I refuse to stay quiet. In another interview with the Daily Mail, he claimed he hung up on Prince Harry after a heated phone all before the royal wedding. Thomas claimed the prince, who had warned him to stay away from the press, told him “ you had listened to me this would never have happened.” "},{"url":null,"title":"libby squire sister polish butcher","story":"NewsLibby Squire: Sister of Polish butcher suspect says he stopped to help crying girlFamily of Paweł Rełowicz, , say he tried to help missing student in Hull - and arrest is a bad dreamShareByAbigail OLeary:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video scene-raglan-street-man-arrested-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe sister of a man arrested after the disappearance of student Libby Squire says he tried to help a crying girl.

The -year-old recently announced she would be writing a second book which will be called, In the Shadows of the Duchess. The first book is slated for publication in April - roughly when Meghan is expected to give birth.Samantha said in a recent interview with the Daily Star the book would cover everything from behind the scenes that the world does not know about.According to the Daily Mail , Meghan has told friends that she stopped reading interviews with members of her family after finding out about the first book two years ago and tries not to look at gossip about herself.The friend is quoted as saying: She cried when she found out about it.

Inland gusts of  mph are expected quite widely, with some places having gusts to  mph, more particularly around exposed coasts and hills.

Vlad Luca Filat funded his extravagant lestyle for years using cash which vanished from three banks. The -year-old is the son of Moldovas jailed former prime minister, Vladimir Filat, who was jailed for nine years in June  for his part in a fraud worth pound million [billion], an eighth of Moldovas GDP. Now Filat Jr, who moved to posh Knightsbridge, London, as a student in July , must hand British authorities nearly pound, thought to be from the fraud. The National Crime Agency said Filat Jr paid pound, up front to rent a flat in Cadogan Square, Knightsbridge, where the average house price is more than poundmillion.   In photos online, Luca can be seen enjoying trips abroad and popping Champagne at pool parties in St Tropez, in the south of France.One image shows his leaning on a Mercedes jeep in a snowy region.Police investigated the student and found three HSBC bank accounts were funded by money from overseas companies, mainly based in Turkey and the Cayman Islands. Cash deposits, including pound, across three days, were also made into these accounts. But Filat Jr, who had no registered income in the UK, has spent huge amounts of cash on luxury goods and services, including a pound, Bentley from a dealership in Mayfair, central London. Filat Jr must now hand authorities pound,. from the three HSBC accounts, which were frozen in May  under the Criminal Finances Act.  District Judge Michael Snow, sitting at the City of London Magistrates Court, said: I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the cash was derived from his fathers criminal conduct in Moldova. The NCA said the money will be passed to the UK Treasury but could eventuallyto Moldova. However the order does not prevent Filat opening another bank account which could receive more suspicious funds, a spokeswoman said. Rob MacArthur, from the NCA international corruption unit, added: Account Freezing Orders are a valuable tool in the fight against illicit finance in the UK.   Where we suspect money in an account is the proceeds of crime, we can apply to the court to freeze and then forfeit the sums. In this case, Vlad Luca Filat was unable to demonstrate a legitimate source for the money and the court determined it to be recoverable.Filat was also told to pay pound, in NCA costs.

Newlyweds have been turning to guests’ snaps and ‘selfies’ to salvage memories of their big day. Darren and Adele McDonagh - who ran Treasured Moments Photography - sometimes failed to turn up to capture the happy day, it has been alleged. When they did arrive they are accused of taking blurred images, focused on grooms’ bottoms rather than the brides’ faces and took months to send the pictures -they did at all. Police and Action Fraud are investigating claims the couple conned brides and grooms by promising drones, photo booths, and minute-by-minute capture of the weddings, and pocketed up to pound,.   Chantelle and David Maconochie, of Chester-le-Street, Co Durham, booked Treasured Moments for  June, last year for a romantic white wedding at St Mary’s and St Cuthbert’s Church, in Middle Chair, followed by a reception and party at the Beamish Park Hotel. Mum-of-four Chantelle, , and bus driver Darren, , shelled out pound to book the couple. But only Adele turned up and the newlyweds say she ruined their nuptials by crying and complaining she was depressed and suffering from anxiety over the loss of a baby. Other brides and grooms - more than  couples - have also reportedly complained the McDonaghs blamed hospital appointments, accidents, family bereavements and vandalism for not delivering the promised wedding photos.   Chantelle said: ”When Adele turned up she told me the day was the anniversary of her baby’s death, which put a downer on the day. “She demanded the DJ play the first dance early so she could get home sooner and she was asking me what poses I wanted to do. “She was crying all the time and missed our first kiss and mucked up me walking down the aisle. “For our first dance all she captured was photos of Darren’s butt and when we eventually got the pictures, after months of waiting and complaining, many were out focus and unusable in a wedding album.”   The couple were forced to drive from Chester-le-Street to Leeds to pick up a USB stick with the unedited photographs. Hundreds of disgruntled couples have taken to social media to expose the McDonaghs and warn other brides not to use them - but scores of newlyweds have been left out of pocket and relying on friends’ mobile photos as memories of their wedding day. The McDonaghs, of Leeds, West Yorks, have refunded some brides and have finally delivered images, but many have been left wanting. They have claimed to have gone bankrupt, but there are no court records to back up this. When confronted at home they refused to comment.

John Baker, , who had several aliases, wore a wig for his appearance at Hull Crown Court on Thursday. He was jailed for five years in  for indecently assaulting the girl after taking her off a school premises in Bradford, reports Hull Live. The self-employed removals firm boss was made subject to a sexual harm prevention order indefinitely, which included a prohibition on him using the internet at home. But after Baker’s lodger reported him for accessing the internet at home, he admitted doing so in the early hours while his partner was asleep.   Police found  images at category A - the most serious -  at category B, and  at category C. There were also  prohibited images, although no detail was given of what these were. Baker told the probation service one image was of an eight-month old baby, but it was not clearthis related to earlier offences. Claire Holmes, prosecuting, said Baker had used a website which showed images from all over the world of people of all ages having sex. He saw adults but also saw a number of child sites where he saw young children performing sexual acts. Baker admitted getting excited but denied getting sexual gratication from the images. He continued viewing them because they continued to excite him, he said.   Baker claimed he had been doing this for three to four months, but Miss Holmes said evidence suggested it had gone on longer. Baker also admitted using computer programmes to conceal his internet usage. Other names used by Baker included Sam Turner. On January  last year, Baker, accompanied by his partner, gave his name as Sam Turner when visiting another sex offender in Hull Prison. He also failed to give details of his other names when attending Osborne Street police station in November , , to complete the sex offender registration form. Baker, of De Grey Street, west Hull, admitted three offences of making indecent photographs, possessing a prohibited image, breaching a sexual harm prevention order , and failing to comply with his notication requirements as a sex offender. He said he kept changing his name to protect his removals business, which was launched eight years ago. His  previous offences included the indecent assault, possessing indecent photographs and pseudo photographs, and failing to comply with notication requirements. Describing the circumstances of the assault on the eight-year-old, Judge Mark Bury said: You had entered a school premises and you led her away. You were to admit to the probation service that had you not been interrupted by the caretaker you would have raped her. Referring to a pre-sentence report, the judge told Bakers barrister, Stephen Robinson: Hes regarded as a high risk of serious harm to children and a very high risk of further offending. Mr Robinson said: One can understand that conclusion the defendant even does to a certain extent. He lost both parents within a short space of time. His father died in prison his mother died of cancer after an illness of six to nine months. Following that he was depressed, started to drink then turned to this sort of offending. The defendant bitterly regrets that, hes sorry for it. He knows hes let down those around him. He knows hell be punished for this and deserves to be. Jailing Baker for five years, the judge told him: I have no doubt at all that you are indeed a dangerous offender and that an extended sentence is warranted. Baker looked shocked at theof his sentence and silently mouthed What  He said Love you to a woman in the public gallery, who began sobbing. He must serve at least two-thirds of the five years before he can apply for parole, and will be on licence for at least three years on release.

Luke Evans, , was left gashed and bloodied after a night out in Manchester, suffering deep wounds to his face.However the heroic boxer was praised by a judge for urging his attacker and accomplices to move away from a le of crime.Manchester Evening News reports that the attack initially put his promising professional boxing career in jeopardy.Thankfully Mr Evans has since recovered and is back in the ring, but he has been left with physical as well as mental scarring. On Friday, the gang of youths involved in the attack were sentenced at Manchester Crown Court. Speaking to the M.E.N after the court hearing, Luke said: My message to those kids is its not too late to turn your lives around. What youve done is wrong, but its not too late. Im sure deep down you have potential to go on and do something good with your lives.   After the attack I was very angry and distressed. It really ruined my le at the time. Kne crime is a big problem and I feel its my responsibility to be a role model for kids who need motivation. I can help them as a sportsman, rather than hold a grudge or want revenge. During the court hearing, Mr Evans was lauded for offering to help his attackers, and for encouraging them to stay away from crime. The -year-old boy who slashed Mr Evans to the face was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in a young offenders institution, after pleading guilty to counts of wounding with intent and possessing an offensive weapon. The M.E.N. appealed for the judge to lt reporting restrictions on the youths, but the judge rejected their application. A -year-old boy and a -year-old boy both received two year youth rehabilitation orders, which includes a curfew and supervision. They both pleaded guilty to counts of violent disorder and possessing an offensive weapon. Trey Millward, now , of Robinia Close, Eccles, received a two year community order, including  rehabilitation activity requirement days,  hours unpaid work and a three month curfew. He admitted one count of violent disorder. Prosecutor Andrew MacIntosh told the court that Mr Evans had been enjoying a night out in Eccles town centre with his girlfriend on August , . Later that night they went to McDonalds for some food, where they came across the youths. Mr Evans said that the youths seemed to be weighing him up.   After the pair left McDonalds, words were exchanged. Mr Evans said he would fight them one on one, but not in public. One of the youths was said to reply: We dont use our fists, we use our weapons. Later one of the youths was attacked by another man, and a scuffle broke out. The brawl spread to near the bus station in Church Street, at about .am, when other men and women also became involved in the altercation. As the violence continued, one youth ran at Mr Evans armed with a bladed weapon, slashing him to the face. He sustained two deep cuts, which as well as being serious threatened his boxing career, with the fear that the wounds could re-openhe got in the ring. The other youths and Millward were all involved in lower level confrontations, and most were later identied from CCTV footage. The boy who stabbed Mr Evans at first claimed he had been in bed at the time of the attack. His barrister Ian McMeekin said that his parents believed he was revising, and that he had sneaked out of the house. Mr McMeekin said the evening started out as a good natured night out, before Mr Evans sustained his staggeringly horric injuries.   The barrister described Mr Evans as a heroic victim, due to his conduct after being attacked. The court heard that Mr Evans posted on social media, offering to speak with his attackers. Mr McMeekin said: Hebravely said that he would happily speak to the offenders that caused him those injuries, and told them what it was they they had done, and encouraged them to take violence off the streets. It reflects very well on Mr Evans, Judge Alan Conrad QC said. Sentencing, the judge told the four defendants: Its clear to me that this was group violence, involving the carrying and use of weapons. The four of you were all concerned in dferent ways.   You were all ready to take part in this shocking incident where members of the public passed through the town centre at night. Addressing the -year-old who attacked Mr Evans, the judge added: You were given a bladed weapon and you ran towards Luke Evans, slashing at him, causing him awful injuries. The effect of the attack was very serious, both physically and psychologically. Luke added: Its been really dficult for me, both physically and mentally its been really tough. Ive had counselling and without the support of the people round me I wouldnt be where I am today. I want to thank my partner, plus my training team Ricky Hatton, Blain Younis and Mike Jackson. Theyve all helped me so much. Luke has won each of his three bouts since his comeback last June and is now eyeing a first belt.

Hannah, from New South Wales in Australia, was shocked when she realised what her little girl had been up to.  The -year-old said: Hannah said: It was a beautul day and I was so excited about the wedding . Id hired a photographer to take some photos of everyone.At that point, wed just had the ceremony, and then we decided to go off to the side to have some family photos taken. All of a sudden she just popped it up to show everyone. There were lots of people standing around watching her, so I think she just thought why not do it. She had learned that little trick just a few days before but had no idea what it meant. But she knew that she would get a strong reaction from it.   All my wedding guests who were watching us get the photos done started cracking up laughing. Ill never forget it. The professional photographer deleted the picture, but Hannah’s sister Sharon luckily had been snapping away the entire time and managed to capture the priceless moment on camera. Community strengthening officer Hannah said the whole family cracked up laughing when they saw the photograph – and her other kids Ashton, , Tyler, , and Halle, , all through their little sister was hilarious. Hannah said this was not the first time the tot had made the obscene gesture and had made a habit of it after witnessing a family friend doing it a few days before the wedding.   Cheeky Maddison even popped up her finger during a girls selfie at her sister Halles graduation from day care - just two weeks after the wedding photo was captured. The mum added that Maddison had absolutely no idea what it meant but said she must have thought it was funny because it always evoked a strong reaction from people. Thankfully nowadays the tot has stopped putting hermiddlefinger up – with Hannah admitting she is relieved that the phase is over. She said: She did it for nearly a month straight. It was funny but Im glad shes stopped doing it now.   It was really hard not to have a giggle, but I didnt want her to think it was okay. I had to always turn away from her and laugh so she wouldnt see me. Everyone thought it was hilarious. It is definitely something to remember. She is such a character and is very outgoing.

She was stunned to see her baby boy covered in hair when he was born. Parvatibai said: “I saw Lalit first half an hour after he was born, I was amazed to see his body covered in extraordinary amount of hair. “We immediately asked the local paediatrician to examine him who trimmed off his excess hair and said that there is no cure for this.   “I have five daughters and we prayed at lot of temples to have a son. Our prayers were answered when Lalit was born. “He is dferent but still very special for me because he was born after many special prayers.” Despite being used to his condition, Lalit often has bad days when due to his excess hair, he faces dficulty in breathing and sight. His parents have tried a number of treatments without success.

Some even call me monkey, he said. “There have been times when other kids throw stones at me and call me names. “But my family and friends come to my rescue and defend me during such incidents.”   He added: I sometimes wish to have some surgery to get rid of excess hair because I want to be friends with everyone.

The performance might not have been as good as against Motherwell and Hearts but every one of us certainly put everything in.“Unfortunately, a strike like that happens and you can’t do anything about it.”Despite only signing for the Dark Blues on January , Dales has already featured five times for the club and is set for his sixth turn-out in tonight’s clash at home to high-flying Kilmarnock.It’s been a non-stop start to le at Dens Park for the -year-old who is enjoying le already in the Scottish top flight and is hoping to experience his first victory in dark blue in just over  hours’ time.He added: “I think I’ve settled in quite well.“It’s definitely dferent up here, it’s a lot quicker, up and down all the time but I think that suits me.“That’s my game, to be dynamic, so I think it probably suits me more up here than down in League One.“I’ve only been here a couple of weeks and I’ve already played four-and-a-half games in two weeks.“Some of the others have played five so it has been pretty thick and fast butwe can put another good performance on again I think we can get the three points.“It’s a great opportunity to do that as long as we work as hard as we did on Saturday. If all the lads put in % like that I don’t see why we can’t get the three points.”Despite coming in from mid-table League One side Scunthorpe to join Dundee’s push to avoid relegation from the Premiership, Dales says he’s up for the challenge.“Some people prefer to go into a promotion-chasing team but, for me, there’s nothing wrong with being in a relegation battle.“I’m up for that and I think every single player in the changing-room is definitely up for it.“With the quality we have and,we can keep showing that for most of the game, there’s no reason why we can’t get to where we should be.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united reduce losses but are urging caution","story":"Dundee United have reduced their losses for the   season but are urging caution that the figure could rise again after a bumper spending in the January window.The club today revealed their year-end financial results for June ,  with an overall loss of £, reduced from ’s figure of £,,.A turnover reduction of £, was offset by nearly £ million in player sales and the six-figure sale of the GA Arena.However, Tannadice managing director Mal Brannigan has warned big spending in the winter window means the  results are likely to see higher losses.He said: “While it is encouraging to see a marked improvement in the club’s financial results year on year, it is worth noting that these results are for the year ended  June, .“It is anticipated this trend will not continue in the current financial year, most signicantly as a consequence of recent investment in the playing squad during the January transfer window.#The change of ownership in December has also seen new investment in other areas of the club, which will be ongoingit fits with the strategic objectives of the organisation, including the re-purchase of Gussie Park, the repositioning of the Academy and the rollout of future refurbishment projects.#These investments will need to be financed by new and ongoing revenue generated by the operations of the club but ultimately underwritten byMark and Scott Ogren.#"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c593edc5c5222.30407689.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds ian harkes is making his dundonian grandad very happy","story":"He had never been to the city before signing for Dundee United and, despite being born down south, Ian Harkes was so young when his family headed back to America he has no memory of his year or two in Britain.However, family ties mean moving to Dundee has been something of a homecoming for the -year-old American.As was well-documented when he signed up last month, grandad James is a Dundonian and was delighted when Ian told him he was joining boyhood heroes United.That made his impressive home debut against Morton at the weekend a special moment not just for Ian but his family back in the States and, in particular, James, who was born a stone’s throw away in Fleming Gardens.For Ian, though, just as special as those family ties is the fact he’s now playing his football in a city and country where football isn’t just a sport, it’s a way of le.“It was good to be in for my home debut at Tannadice and I thought my energy was good,” he said.“I spoke to my grandad a couple of weeks ago and he was over the moon at me signing and I’ll be speaking to him again soon because I’m sure he was delighted about me playing at Tannadice.“The whole family caught the game I think and they were pleased. I actually don’t have any relatives here in Dundee because they all moved to America but I’m sure they will be over soon to watch me in person.”And the former DC United man admits being in an environment where the population live and breathe football is a special feeling.His grandad’s love of United and the fact dad John, a former USA skipper, spent a big chunk of his career in England, means that’s not come as a surprise.“Over here everyone talks about football all the time and it’s the culture. It’s everywhere, which I love, and it’s all over the city.“There are so many competing sports back in the US that are big but football is getting bigger and at the final this year in Atlanta you saw , people there and that is great to see. The game is going to keep growing there and you will see more and more players coming through but here it’s on a dferent level.“I knew what it was like over here, I got it from my dad from when he was here. My mum and dad talked about it a lot, how everyone is immersed in the sport.“I get in taxis here and they are talking about it and all the people are. I love that.”For Ian, though, just being able to experience le in a football-mad country is not going to be enough.He’s come to United to progress his career and that means helping get them back to the Premiership and making a name for himself at that level.With the squad Robbie Neilson has put together, that’s a goal he’s convinced he will achieve.“There’s a lot of new guys in the squad and I thought you saw us start off well against Morton,” he added.“You also saw glimpses in the second half where we had to finish off the game and get that third goal and we didn’t.“However, I think in the first half the guys were moving the ball around well and getting into good positions.“Pete Pawlett was coming inside for us and Pav Safranko was stretching them. That got us the space to play and I think we got a bit away from that in the second half but it will come.“If we keep going and show our class we will finish off games a bit better.“I think, like the manager has said, there are a lot of good players who have good experience so when they get in, they just gel.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/iStock-177043240.jpg ","title":"for a limited time dundee takeaway gives customers 50 off to mark opening","story":"A Dundee takeaway is offering customers a %-off deal to mark its opening.Manzil Indian Takeaway, which has opened at a Perth Road, is offering the deal on all curries ordered by phone for the remainder of February.

It’s one that could leave Keyes and Dundee-based managing director, John Nelms, less than impressed,not surprised.They’ve previously stated the proposed increase in shareholding would have resulted in major tax benefits as they press ahead with the planned Camperdown move.As they informed members and the club of their decision, the society expressed the opinion they’re acting “in the best interests of the society as a whole”.

That could change in Saturday’s Scottish Cup visit to St Mirren and at the very least he will provide experienced cover for Benjamin Siegrist.Charlie SeamanIt was a dficult start for the Bournemouth kid as he made his debut in the defeat at Ayr United just hours after flying north to begin his loan. The -year-old, however, did reasonably well at Somerset Park and looked good as he made his home debut in Saturday’s win over Morton.Mark ReynoldsThe vastly-experienced Aberdeen defender showed his ability and know-how as he strolled through his debut against the Ton, despite injury meaning that was his first competitive outing since last May. Reynolds was handed the captain’s armband and showed leadership qualities that could prove vital in the coming months.Mark ConnollyThe arrival from Crawley Town is another centre-half and Saturday saw him show instant signs of being able to form a solid partnership with Reynolds. The Irishman is a no-nonsense defender who looks perfect for the physical requirements of the Championship.Calum ButcherBack for a second spell at United having previously played at Tannadice under Jackie McNamara, the midfielder was brought in to add bite in that area of the park. He lasted an hour at the weekend and in that time won his tackles and had a big influence on those around him in the middle of the park.Ian HarkesThe -year-old American was something of a surprise arrival but with his energetic box-to-box running has shown why Robbie Neilson wanted him. The former DC United team-mate of Wayne Rooney covered a lot of ground and, as he showed in the Scottish Cup win at Montrose, also has a goal in him.Morgaro GomisAnother who is ing to United, in his case for a third spell in tangerine. Gomis blotted his copy book by picking up a red card in that defeat at Ayr. Now , the  Scottish Cup winner is unlikely to start every game but will provide good cover in central midfield.Peter PawlettThe manager spent most of last month working to secure the services of the former Aberdeen man who played for him at MK Dons. Pawlett wasted no time showing why with a superb debut against Morton that saw him grab his first United goal. His pace, use of the ball and movement off it means he will be a very big player.Cammy SmithThe third of the arrivals who have played for United before. Smith has fitted in well since joining up from St Mirren. He goes about his work in quietly but his knowledge of how to win promotion from this ision makes him an asset.Aidan NesbittAnother who played for Neilson at MK Dons. The former Celtic kid has signed until the end of the season and so far only one of his five appearances have been as a starter. At , the attacker could be one for the future –he can add goals to the nice touches seen so far.Osman SowAnother ex-MK Don and the Swedish striker also played for Neilson during a successful spell at Hearts. The -year-old has had a lack of game time buthe can get his match fitness back quickly there is no question he has the ability to get goals in this ision."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"equal-pay-glasgow-city-council-signs-off-on-548m-deal-for-almost-16000-workers","story":"GLASGOW City Council has signed off on a pound million equal-pay settlement with nearly , current and former employees after spending the past two weeks ironing out the finer points of the deal."},{"url":null,"title":"equal-pay-glasgow-reacts-as-council-finally-approves-548m-deal-for-women-workers","story":"GLASGOWrsquoS long-running equal pay dispute is finally over after councillors formally approved a compensation deal for claimants."},{"url":null,"title":"equal-pay-in-glasgow-hundreds-celebrate-as-500m-deal-gets-official-go-ahead","story":"GLASGOWrsquoS long-running equal pay dispute is finally over after councillors formally approved a compensation deal for claimants."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-city-council-to-buy-dalmarnock-legacy-hub-for-1","story":"GLASGOW City Council will buy back Dalmarnockrsquos Legacy Hub for pound in a bid to reopen the community facility and nursery."},{"url":null,"title":"have-your-say-on-new-plans-for-glasgows-broomielaw","story":"PLANS to revamp the Broomielaw area of the city have taken a step forward after councillors backed public consultation on the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-city-council-leader-susan-aitken-defends-attending-event-linked-with-lavish-parties","story":"COUNCIL leader Susan Aitken has defended her decision to attend an event associated with lavish parties and alleged sexist behaviour."},{"url":null,"title":"greatest-showman-star-hugh-jackman-announces-third-glasgow-gig-date","story":"GLASGOW Hugh Jackman fans have been thrown a leline as the star announces a THIRD gig date in the city."},{"url":null,"title":"honest-builder-reunites-glasgow-homeowner-with-lost-wedding-ring","story":"An honest tradesman who ed a long-lost wedding ring after finding it on a job has been nominated for a national award."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-venue-to-host-film-festival-celebrating-jim-carrey","story":"A SOUTH SIDE bar will celebrate the work of one of cinemas best known comedians with a film festival in his name next months."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-star-callum-mcgregor-is-scotlands-best-and-the-worlds-busiest-player","story":"THE song dedicated to Callum McGregor by Celtic supporters boasts that there is no-one better."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-secures-bid-to-host-first-ever-uci-cycling-world-championships-in-2023","story":"THE eyes of the sporting world will fall on Glasgow once again as the city hosts the first ever UCI Cycling World Championships."},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117050.jpg","title":"500000 project for A82 layby","story":"The project will see around  tonnes of rock removed from the rock-face next to the roadside, with specialist netting and bolts installed across the rock to secure and stabilise the slope.A BEAR Scotland spokeswoman said: ldquoThis will help ensure that this section of the trunk road remains safe for road users and that the embankment is protected from debris reaching the roadside.The project is due to start on Monday and is expected to take up to  weeks to complete.The improvements will be carried out daily between am and pm with work taking place.A mph convoy system will be in operation during the project.Saturday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119524.jpg","title":"Adventure race set for the Highlands","story":"THE Highlands will welcome a major international expedition adventure race for the very first time this summer.The Open Adventure bi-annual ITERA event is a non-stop five day race which will challenge teams as they tackle a km course across the region as part of the Adventure Racing World Series.Its Highland debut will be the first time it has come to Scotland since .James Thurlow, director of Open Adventure, said: ldquoWe have designed a race format and course that will allow all the teams to finish.

A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

However, a good friend of the museum has stepped forward with the offer and agreed to allow Dunadd Community Enterprise time to explore the possibility of buying the building and make a final decision that any community use has the full support of its members and is sustainable.Since the Church of Scotland moved to its new premises in Kilmartin, it has been its intention to sell Kilmartin Church and the Glebe, as well as the churches in Ford, Kilmichael Glassary and Kilmichael of Inverlussa. Kilmartin Museum has been in discussions with the Church of Scotland about buying the Glebe to use for their education programmes, and to develop overflow parking in a small area to accommodate the extra visitors expected when the redeveloped museum opens in .At the recent AGM, members of Dunadd Community Enterprise supported the committee to go ahead with seeking funding to commission a full feasibility study that would explore sustainable community use of the building. Funds would be required to buy, renovate and convert the church.There have been lots of ideas and discussion, but careful business planning is required to ensure whatever the church is used for would attract grant funding and crucially, would be sustainable in the long term. This will take some time and funding needs to be sought for a feasibility study in the first instance, so Dunadd Community Enterprise could not currently buy the church.Kilmartin Museum already has funding in place to purchase the Glebe Field, and they need to go ahead with this to keep to their redevelopment project timescales. However, the benefactor has said it will be possible to maintain public access to the historic stones housed in the church and that the museum can also use the building while the building work required during the redevelopment project is taking place.Dr Sharon Webb, museum director said: ‘It would have been a real shamethe church and the historic stones had become inaccessible, and this decision by the church head office could have presented real dficulties to both the museum and community enterprise, so it’s great that a temporary solution has been found. It’s wonderful that there are such generous and philanthropic people who want to make a dference to both the museum and the local community.’David Bracken, chairman of the Dunadd Community Enterprise, added: ‘This gives us the time we need to explore all the possibilities and make sure thatwe do go ahead and raise funds to buy the church, it’s the right thing for the community now, and for future generations.’Negotiations between the Church of Scotland head office and the anonymous buyer are ongoing."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert blow after festivals funding bid rejected","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTarbert is undeniably the festival capital of Argyll, but organisers say two summer events in the fishing village will be #diminished# after council cash was refused.Tarbert Enterprise Company submitted bids to Argyll and Bute Council#s Strategic Events and Festivals Grant Scheme for three events # Tarbert Scottish Series , Tarbert Music Festivaland Tarbert Seafood Festival .The bids for the music and seafood festivals were rejected in their entirety, while the Scottish series yachting event was granted £,.John Hardie, chairman of Tarbert Enterprise Company, said the two high-profile summer festivals would be #diminished# after failing to receive council support.#It#s pretty devastating when you think you#ve put a good bid together,# said Mr Hardie.He questioned why three large events # Cowal Highland Gathering, Tiree Music Festival and Oban Live # should receive around  per cent of the total funding allocation of £,.Mr Hardie asked: #Are these events being generously funded at the expense of others #He added: #A contribution would have been acceptable.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback.

Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

In my current role, there is barely a day that goes by without discussing with a parent or carer the impact of sugar in their childrenrsquos food, but, letrsquos face it, fat, salt and sugar make things taste nice, and itrsquos easy to fall into the trap of overindulgence.ldquoThatrsquos okay every now and again, but regular overindulgence of fat, sugar and salt leads to grave consequences, such as tooth decay, heart disease, diabetes and cancer.ldquoObesity, including childhood obesity, is fast becoming the epidemic of our age.ldquoMany of us are blissfully unaware just how much salt, sugar and fat is in the foods we buy.ldquoBig companies which produce, promote and retail these products are in it to maximise profits.ldquoThey have at their disposal expensive advertising and marketing which hugely influence our choices and purchasing habits.However, Galashiels councillor Harry Scottfelt the proposals amounted to unwelcome government meddling with personal choice, saying: ldquoIrsquom not in agreement with any of the proposals in this paper.,params: .pushldquoI appreciate the problem, but this is typical nanny state, dictating to us how we should live our lives.ldquoIt will cause unnecessary restrictions on business, specialist retailers will find it hard to market themselves, and I doubt very much whether it will have any impact on the groups it is

their own lives and lestyle choices, and as long as you keep within the law, the state should have no place in telling you what you can eat or drink.A motion put forward by Councillor Scott called for the response to be completely rejected, but it was not supported by his fellow councillors.Instead, they opted to vote to submit the consultation response in full, albeit as a council officer response not as a political response.According to NHS Health Scotland, in ,  per cent of Scotlandrsquos children were at risk of becoming overweight and  per cent were at risk of becoming obese.That same year,

charity.The Peebles siblings were invited to take part to represent Scotland and their images will be seen across the country as the campaign is launched ready for Brain Tumour Awareness month in March.Across the UK, other children who have either been bereaved by a brain tumour, are living with a brain tumour or have a close family member who has been diagnosed, are also taking part to represent their regions.They are all donning their best headwear from beanies to cowboy hats, trilbies to Panamas, baseball caps to novelty headpieces, and are asking others to join them for Wear A Hat Day, which takes place on Friday, March .The event is expected to smash all records as it marks its th year.Chloe and Oscarrsquos dad Matt was diagnosed after collapsing at home with an aggressive and incurable glioblastoma multormebrain tumour.Despite undergoing surgery and chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment, Matt passed away less than two years later, aged , in March , not long after his th wedding anniversary.Mum Gill, a teaching secretary at Edinburgh College of Art, said: ldquoWhen Matt was diagnosed, we were told that the average le expectancy of this type of tumour was  to  months.\"The grieving process for me started  months before Matt died as the two of us came to terms with the idea that we were not going to have the le together we planned.\"I spent a lot of time listening to a playlist we compiled which represented our  years together.ldquoNow I am doing my best to give our children the childhood we had planned together.ldquoI am so proud of Oscar and Chloe for being part of the Wear A Hat Day campaign.\"It means so much to my family and me to help contribute towards a cure, so itrsquos an honour to have them take part. Chloe and Oscar had such a fun time at the photoshoot too and it will be a lovely memento for them to look back on.Wear A Hat Day also has the backing of supermodel, businesswoman and brain tumour survivor Caprice who underwent surgery to remove a meningioma brain tumour two years ago.A patron of Brain Tumour Research, Caprice plays a key role in raising awareness of the disease and campaigning for the government and the larger cancer charities to increase national investment in research. Also supporting this yearrsquos fundraiser is Strictly Come Dancing finalist Debbie McGee who lost her magician husband Paul Daniels to the disease three years ago.Corporate supporters already signed up for the fundraiser include Specsavers, Hobbycraft, and Venture Studios ndash the latter worked with families across the UK who have been affected by brain tumours to create the stunning portraits used in the campaign.,params: .pushAlso taking part will be hundreds of schools, workplaces, and iniduals who will don their hat of choice and hold a whole host of hat-themed fundraising events in support of Brain Tumour Research.Sue Farrington Smith, Chief Executive of Brain Tumour Research, told us: ldquoWe are extremely grateful to Chloe and Oscar and their mum for helping us to launch Wear A Hat Day .\"I know that people will be both distressed and inspired to hear the stories of all of these families who, like my own, know the pain of a brain tumour diagnosis.ldquoWe are entirely committed to easing this pain by improving treatment options for patients and, ultimately, finding a cure. Brain tumours kill more children and adults under the age of  than any other cancer yet, historically, just one percent of the national spend on cancer research has been allocated to this devastating disease Brain Tumour Research is proud to be changing this.ldquoThe sad truth is that brain tumours are indiscriminate and can affect anyone at any age and this means the impact on families is enormous. Too many children are losing siblings, parents and grandparents, too many parents are enduring the agony of their childrsquos diagnosis, and society as a whole continues to bear the burden of increased costs through the NHS, lost taxes, and demands on the benefits system.Wear A Hat Day has raised over a million pounds since the launch of Brain Tumour Research  years ago.The big day will see schools, workplaces, families and iniduals across the UK fundraising and taking part in fun events to raise awareness of brain tumours and help fund le-saving research.Funds raised will develop the charityrsquos network of brain tumour research centres in the UK where scientists are focused on improving outcomes for patients and, ultimately, finding a cure.To get involved, or donate, please

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge.

I suspect the Prime Minister of being the sort of woman who might choose I Will Survive when roped into the karaoke, but no one can deny that shersquos done it her way. Even though her way has created most of the problems.But however traumatic and alarming the road to Brexit has been, yoursquove got to give this political drama credit for retaining the ability to surprise. Of all the possible outcomes , the one which never occurred to me was that Jeremy Corbyn would start talking some sort of sense.I donrsquot want to overstate the case, obviously. The letter that the Labour leader sent to the Prime Minister still describes a kind of Brexit which I donrsquot like or want. But I think wersquove all accepted that wersquore none of us going to get what we want, and Mr Corbyn ndash in his own way just as stubborn as Mrs May ndash has at least managed to do what she has not, and drop some of his pet preconceptions of what Brexit has to be.Therersquos the small point that the Labour Partyrsquos previous position, set out in six tests of spectacularly vague aspiration, not to mention downright fantasy, was even more ludicrous than Mrs Mayrsquos vision. Indeed, the only one of those tests which had any detail ndash that we retain absolutely every benefit of EU membership, but leave anyway ndash was not just fantastic but by its own definition literally impossible.The same canrsquot be said of the new version of Labour policy, though, as is also true of the Tories, itrsquos never entirely clear whether this is actually policy or merely what think-tanks like to call ldquoa contribution to the debate. But it is actually a contribution and a reasonable and constructive one, at that.Instead of the six tests, there are five demands, simply described and perfectly cogent: a permanent UK-wide customs union alignment with the single market alignment with EU rights and protections participation in EU agencies and close co-operation on security, including the European Arrest Warrant. The remarkable thing about the letter detailing theseis not just that itrsquos thoroughly serious, but that it is quite reasonable to think of all those demands as achievable. In fact, though it doesnrsquot describe them in terms of the EEA, the five demands are very similar to the Norway + or Common Market . solutions which have been suggested by the likes of Labourrsquos Stephen Kinnock and the Toriesrsquo Nick Boles.There are several advantages, of which the main ones are that itrsquos a kind of off-the-shelf solution which the EU has already given other countries, that it delivers Brexit without throwing trade and business into chaos, and that it probably stands as good a chance as anything of getting through the Commons.I repeat that I donrsquot like it myself. If you were to choose between being in a customs union or the single market, yoursquod go for the latter. A permanent customs union, without EU membership, would put us in the same position as Turkey, unable to strike independent trade deals with third countries, but compelled to accept the terms of deals the EU negotiates with other nations, without any say in formulating them, and with those third countries under no obligation to reciprocate.But as Mr Corbynrsquos letter points out, EU leaders have already said that such changes to the Political Declaration are possible,there are changes to Mrs Mayrsquos red lines .The fact that it would involve the Prime Minister backing down at all is one good reason for thinking that this Labour plan probably wonrsquot happen. Even so, the partyrsquos new position is a signicant development. EvenI donrsquot think itrsquos a sensible plan, itrsquos at least not a nonsensical one.The other thing that makes it signicant is that Mr Corbyn has nailed his colours to the mast. Hersquos claried that Labour remains committedto delivering Brexit, though a fairly soft version of it. That may not be the majority view of Labour members, or even MPs, but at least it lets the electorate know the partyrsquos stance.Last week, I thought that the only realistic option that avoided a no deal Brexit was a rewording of Mrs Mayrsquos withdrawal agreement. If ndash a hugendash some substantial alteration to it can be negotiated, it still seems much the most likely outcome. Thatrsquos mainly, of course, because the Prime Minister is not the kind of person who has regrets, even though they ought to be too many to mention. But the sht in Labourrsquos position revives the outside possibility that something akin to an EEA solution could be got through the Commons.Itrsquos also,there were anyone out there still flogging the Peoplersquos Vote horse, a fairly bald statement that, as far as the Labour leader is concerned, that particular nag has been shot and sent to the knackerrsquos yard. Whether this new stance is in the Labour Partyrsquos best electoral interests, or stands any realistic chance of coming about, matters less than the fact that at last someone has produced a relatively sensible proposal, evenitrsquos one I donrsquot much like.

When theyre talking about a deal, what is that deal \"I was waking up every two hours looking at my phone to follow the results. So when they said were going ahead with Brexit, I elbowed my husband and said: its happening. He looked at me and said, what are you talking about  I said, it is happening, and were out. I cried, because I felt completely betrayed. All of a sudden, the mask fell off. The face of the country was saying, we dont want you here and we dont want to be in the whole EU. I couldnt believe it.\"I have been swinging left to right, not being sure what the future is for Europeans as a whole. For my case, my son was born here, and I think were okay. The line of work that I have, we always have it sorted in the UK. We are working closely with the Scottish government, because I work in public health.\"Some people say to me, what are you going to do when Brexit comes  Youre going to have to quit or leave the UK. I say, do you know what Im going to do  Im going to make a lot of money, because you will need me because you wont have people and I will raise my price. Andyou want to export anything to the EU, you are going to have to pay me whatever I want.\"Nikolett Barra, , financial administrator, lived in UK for  years\"Brexit - a word which I laughed at first and now it just makes me shiver. I fail to understand why anyone in their right mind would head towards this much uncertainty. Is power more important than the people  People give you the poweryou allow them to do so.\"I was not allowed a say in this huge change, I was not allowed to vote about my own future, purely because I do not hold the right kind of passport.\"For EU citizens Brexit is like being told to sit in the back of a van which is taking you somewhere you didnrsquot want to go. Would it be such a terrible thing to apply the brake pedal, stop for a second and admit that the GPS coordinates we entered two years ago were wrong  Decisions can still be respected without driving off the clf.\"Vera Kempe, , professor, lived in UK for  years\"The moral fallacy of Brexit is that people like me, who came under the correct assumption that they are perfectly within their rights to settle here suddenly find themselves treated as the other by the predominant media discourse.\"Imagine you had moved within the Union of British nations from, say, Devon to Dundee, and suddenly - by some unforeseeable twist of political events - find yourself being asked to apply for the right to remain in your house, your job and with your family. Wouldnrsquot you perceive such a retroactive change of status as a grave injustice \"The saddest part is this: While I as an EU citizen retain my right to move freely across the  member states my Scottish friends, colleagues, students and family members will loose this right. This to me is the biggest tragedy of all.\"Trudy Duffy, , shop owner, lived in UK for  yearsI am a mother, we, shopkeeper, community councillor, volunteer and neighbour. I am Dutch. Which is why I have been having nightmares for the last  frac years. Will I have to sell my business  Will I be able to access the NHS  Will I be able to vote  Do I want to stay in the UK I will shrivel a little the first time someone asks me whether I have the right to access the NHS or such. Scotland may be less hostile to foreigners than the rest of the UK but Scotland is not able to shelter us from all that comes out of Westminster. After Windrush, can we trust the Home Office to get it right with us EU nationals Folk keep telling me that this is not about people like me. But it is: it is about your family, your shopkeepers, your volunteers and your neighbours.\"Jeacutereacutemie Fernandes, , college librarian, lived in UK for yearsThe fact is I donrsquot know how Brexit will affect me. And neither do the UK government or the EU leaders, because none of these questions have been answered,  days before Brexit. Its very apparent now that itll be a no-deal Brexit.From a professional point of view, Brexit is obviously very worrying. I have built a career here, I am responsible for a college library and I am on the board of the professional body for librarians in Scotland . I am not on a permanent contract and I am not even sure that my employer will be able to renew my contractI have to get a VISA. Many Further and Higher Education institutions like mineare dependent on EU funding, so I am very worried about the future of colleges and universities in Scotland once the EU money is withdrawn.From a personal point of view, itrsquos even worse, I am supposed to get married in April  to a Scot. I am not even sure Irsquoll be allowed to stay in the country until then. My partner doesnrsquot speak French so heading back to France is a non-starter.Patrice Fabien, , solicitor, lived in UK for  years\"Brexit is the most selfish political act a nation has sought fit to impose on its citizens, at home and abroad, and on EU citizens living in the UK. It is no exaggeration to say that the noxious political and social narrative from the very top of British society ndash some of whom should know better given their ethnic backgrounds and religious beliefs ndash have disturbed me in ways I had never thought I would feel or experience.\"For the first time in my le, I have had to face up to the fact that my country of origin has been enough to deprive me of rights I believed were inalienable ndash through no fault of my own and with no action required on my part.\"It will take decades to erase the damage, in human terms, what a handful of people has imposed from what is nothing more than a passing whim.\"Bregje van Veelen, , researcher, lived in UK for  years\"The day after the Brexit referendum I was in shock, with no idea what to expect. To tackle the uncertainty I started the process to Brexit-proof myself almost straight away. I applied for a Registration Certicate, Residence Card, and ultimately British Citizenship.\"To be honest, it feels somewhat bittersweet: to have become a British citizen at a time where EU citizens are increasingly made to feel like others.I now feel more secure, although my job prospects are uncertain . I also worry for EU citizens here whose road to settled status or citizenship is more challenging, as well as for British nationalsand their ability to move to the continentthey ever wanted or needed to.\"One final thing I dont fully understand is the governments outward hostility towards EU citizens, such as Theresa Mays lsquoqueue-jumpingrsquo comment. Do they not realise that those of us who have applied for British citizenship will all have a vote in the next general election too \"Alessio Albanese, , researcher, lived in the UK for nineyears\"Although it is hard to fully comprehend what Brexit will entail, it does not sound auspicious at all. I do not mean this solely from a personal perspective as a EU citizen, but also from a societal perspective. It is now clear that Brexit is not going to be the idyllic tale they wanted people to believe.\"As I write, the government is stepping up preparations for a no-deal. This eventuality would, without a doubt, present serious and long lasting negative consequences, which will be detrimental for the whole of society both in the short and long term.\"My greatest concern is related to the NHS and its future. As a researcher in Public Health, I feel strongly about universal health care free at the point of access, and I am at best dubious that this is a priority for the current governmentrsquos post-Brexit plans.\"Professor Simone Baglioni, , professor, lived in UK for nine years\"Professionally for me Brexit opens up a period of great uncertainty given that my research activities have been primarily funded by EU money: it is not clear yetUK academics will be eligible for EU funding at the same conditions they are now. Moreover, for me research is a collective or group experience that has to go across country borders: being exposed to the iety of ersity of cases and situations we have in Europe is a great form of learning. I could not imagine keeping doing research without being exposed to such ersities and to European research networks and communities.\"Personally, for someone like me that deeply believes in Europe and feels as a European citizen, Brexit has brought in a sense of rejection, likethe community that hosted me at some point decided I was not welcome anymore. Its a hard feeling to bear with.\"Erik Meyer, , assistant manager of university, lived in UKfor  years\"Brexit came as a complete shock to me in June . The night before the vote, me and my we had joked about the UK ldquopulling a Trump and voting out but when the result was announced my heart sank and it has remained down in the pit of my stomach since as Irsquove watched with horror how it has all panned out.\"One of the first things the Government said was we would be fine and nothing would change, yet over  years later I am facing a loss of rights through the Governments ldquosettled status and I very much fear for my future here despite having been here legally since . My pension, my right to work, my access to the NHS, and what status my future children will have all weigh heavily on me.\"My future here is now uncertain and Irsquom thinking of leaving.\"Professor Martijn Steultjens, , professor, lived in UK for eight years\"Professionally, Brexit is a disaster for our international research. Even before Brexit has taken effect, we are already seeing less collaboration with our European colleagues due to uncertainties about continued funding and the freedom of movement of researchers between the EU and UK.\"Personally, it feels like a kick in the teeth. Brexit was ldquowon on a dislike of others and a disregard for facts, which for a non-British academic like me is impossible to understand or accept. I am very proud that my adopted home, Scotland, is dferent, but have lost all respect for whatrsquos happening down south and the UK as an institution.\"Elina Dagdeleni, , media and communications officer, lived in UK for seven years\"I have spent the last seven years of my le in Scotland. I studied at Caledonian University in Glasgow, found full-time employment with Environmental Protection Scotland through the  Commonwealth Games legacy scheme and have built a le and a home here.\"This whole situation makes me very anxious as I do not knowone day I will be requested to leave my job, home and my circle of friends.

However,it does go ahead, I will have to consideritrsquos still the country I want to live in.Antje Karl, , knitting cafe owner\"Ive actually been here for both referendems. Whats really angered me and made me feel really powerless is that I was here for the independence referendum and I had a vote, but I didnt have a vote in the Brexit referendum, even though you could argue that I would be one of the people who is likely to be the most impacted by it. That was one of the things that was such a punch to the gut. We had this independence referendum where everyone had a vote and everyone was part of the process, and then its the complete opposite for Brexit. At the time, nobody really expected it to go that way. My little boy was just a few months old, and I remember waking up and looking at him, and thinking, what have I done  I started a family and I thought I knew what our future held and what our path was, and then the rug got pulled out from under our collective feet, and we still dont know whats going on.\"Realistically, I dont think anyone is going to show up from the Home Office and try to deport me, but I dont trust this government. If you look at the news youve got another Windrush citizen that theyre trying to deport. Whats to say that thirty years down the line theyve lost our paperwork and try to do the same thing. Especially with the settled status, we dont get a bit of paper - its all digital and its on their servers. Sotheres some issue down the line, I will have no way of proving that I have settled status. I donthave a letter that says, congratulations. Im not in a particularly straightforward employment situation because I run my own business. I have some Ps going back, but I moved a few years ago so I dont have all my paperwork. If I want to prove my lease for the last five years, I cant actually do that because the letting agents that had my last lease have closed down in the meantime. Because its all digital, it feels really ephemeral and it could all just disappearI blink.\"Birte Riter Millard, , marketing specialist, lived in UK for  years\"Having worked and studied here and paid taxes and contributed to the British economy, it was disappointing to not be able to vote. In the grand scheme of Brexit now happening, us Europeans having to apply to settlementship and all sorts of other forms when we didnt have a vote, it kind of is frustrated. Another dimension of it is that being in Scotland, the majority voted to stay, so there is the failure of representation. The representation of a democratic vote should include all of a countrys residents. So its dficult to see where the inclusions and exclusions have to be made.\"I think one thing that my mother in law and her boyfriend, they voted to leave and in their mind it was to stop immigration. But for me, Brexit is the epiphany of xenophobia at the moment, because its segregating which people you want to come to Britain and which ones you dont. It affects all Europeans - kids in foster care, kids that have come here that have no parents, the elderly, forced marriages. They all have to deal with settlement applications, and theyre the ones who will lose out, it wont be the lawyers and doctors coming from France and Germany and Spain. We all have to swallow the spoon with a bit of sugar, because whats coming is not going to be pleasant. Coming from Germany and having a history of segregation and racism.\"Patricia Cuni, , digital marketing, lived in UK for five years\"I am not happy about Brexit. It causes me a lot of anxiety and uncertainty, and I do feel like Im being held ransom. They still dont know whats going to happen, and I cant make plans for my le. It feels like someone could knock on my door and deport us back to Spain. I think they dont have a plan - they started working on it two months ago and everything has been very rushed. They didnt know what the seriousness was of what they were embarking on, and they have been treating Europeans living in the UK as bargaining chips doesnt really help.\"It feels like a rejection of me by the government and by people in general. European people like being here and paying taxes and integrating and all of a sudden we become second class citizens and leeches who are taking advantage of the system, which we are not, and foreigners who are not welcome. One of the things that I hate very much is my friends saying oh this is not about you. And they say this because I have a good job, I have a good le and I speak a very decent level of English, and am very involved in the community. But they forget that I am part of a bigger collective, and we are not what the media told them we are. I think there has been a lot of misinformation and a lot of lies, and blaming European citizens. The Tory government has used Europeans as the scapegoat for decades of austerity policies that have had a very big impact on lower class people, instead of facing what they have done to this country.\"Lindis Kipp, , teacher, lived in UK for  years\"Its certainly a lot worse in England, but I have encountered Leave voters here at my workplace. It makes me angry and it makes me feel unwelcome. Particularly when they try and justy it to you. Id rather they just own up and say sorry, I wish that you would just go, and be honest. Although I dont think they necessarily think that, and they dont know what they want.\"I have actually stopped listening to the news more than once a day, because I cant bear it. Every time you think it cant get worse or more ridiculous it does, and I just dont have the mental capacity to keep up with the number of terrible things that happen every single day.\"I have stocked up - I have a stockpile of non-perishable foods, nappies, cat litter. Tins of beans, fruit and pasta. Not because I think we will run out of food so badly that people are going to starve, but Scotland being at the very end of the supply line in Britain, supermarkets started running out of food last summer when it snowed. Sothere are massive delays down south, things are not going to get to us that quickly. Im trying to avoid going to the supermarket in the first couple of weeks after a no-deal Brexit when it gets really panicky and people start being horrible to each other.\"Elizabeth Bea, , teacher, lived in UK for  years\"I dont have settlement here, because when my husband and my son did settlement, because I was European, the lawyer didnt put me down because it wasnt required. So my son is entitled to stay here, but not me. Under these conditions, I would have to apply. So that makes me very nervous, because I know how the Home Office can be quite erratic, and their behaviour can be quite strange.\"I hopefully should be okay, but I have seen people in dferent situations because I work in the languages department, and I have seen people who have been granted a visa for five years, apply for indefinite leave to remain and then have it refused. Anything can happen, and you always feel that although it appears to be easy enough, it makes you nervous. If I applied for it and was rejected, I would lose my job. Ive got a mortgage, Ive got a child, and Ive been with my employer for  years. Imaginethe Home Office does one of their weird things that they tend to do to people, and then I lose my job. Although it might not happen, you always have that at the back of your head and youre always worried about things like this, because the decisions are made in England, not in Scotland. With Scotland not having their independence, you always have to rely on what England decides down there when it comes to immigration. You feel very vulnerable and at risk.\"Fran Crueller, , primary school teacher, lived in UK for  years\"Everyone who lives in the UK now wont have the chance to experience what I have done in my le. To have the chance to live in a dferent country, learning about dferent culture, meeting dferent people and learning a language. I am a school teacher, so I see that my children will be okay because they have dual nationalities and they will be able to move freely between Europe and here, but I see the children in the school and a lot of them will not have the chance as it seems right now. And I think thats a great expereince in anyones le, to travel and meet new people.\"I will have to think about my future here. Im still waiting to see what the outcome of it is, to see the consequences. At some point, I suppose I will go back to Spain. Im wanting to know what is going to happen so I can have a clearer idea of what to do next.\"Trisha Hall, , social worker, lived in UK for  years\"Brexit when it was first muted seemed a strange concept that I naively thought would not have a hope in hell. To say I was taken aback at the result is an understatement. Like many, I went through the ious stages of what feels like a grieving process: disbelief, denial, anger although I havenrsquot really reached acceptance. There have been lighter moments when others told me ldquoNicola says you can stay! after a statement from our FM and I must admit that I have personally not met any negative reactions from any people in my work or personal le.\"My mother was English and married a Dutchman, I thought I had reset the balance. It now feels very uncomfortable and unsettling to be subject to what feels like an imposition after working in the UK for over  years justying why one should be allowed to remain. This is my home, it is where my children are, my friends, my networks. I work within a profession which recognises human rights as the foundation of all our activity, and my experience of Scotland has been of a nation where many people are committed to recognise this.\"The outlook for Europeans in Scotland will hopefully reflect the outcome of the Scottish vote on Brexit, we really need migration to ensure a stable future. I know the positive impact EEA workers make on our social work and social care services so I hope there will be cross party support in the Scottish Parliament to enable a positive long-term way forward so we can stay part of this great country.\"Join in on Twitter @heraldscotland using #BrexitVoices or go to our Facebook page.Are you an EU citizen from outwith the UK living in Scotland who supports Brexit  Let us know.

So, sometimes are local sporting rivalries.\"My girlfriend Susan is an Ayr fan,\" says Iain. \"She stood in in the Talbot end. She would probably say Talbot is her wee team.Iain, a former health worker, admits he has a big team, Celtic. What would happenAuchinleck played Celtic  Who would he support. \"Talbot, of course,\" he says.This - for Auchinleck folk - is key. The spirit of a mining community - when your colleague always had to have your back, regardless of politics, religion or background - lives on in sport.\"You talk about that Rangers and Celtic thing,\" explains Iain. \"They all used to work together, now they play together and they drink together - there are no Rangers or Celtic pubs - and they watch Talbot together.\"This community pride has rubbed off on the club. \"We dont get the best players because we pay the most money, \"Iain says. \"The players are there because they want to be. They have kept themselves at the top of the game by the way they have been run.\"Success is not new. \"The main thing for this club is the league and the junior cup,\" Iain says. \"Up till this season people were not that enamoured about playing with the big clubs. It took a wee bit away from the junior cup. This season has an amazing run. It has given the club an exposure you cannot buy.\"Iain has his whole route on the \"lang whang\" - the historic A from Ayr to Edinburgh - planned for Sundays match.Rab Cross, picture by Colin MearnsRab Cross, , is all set too. Hes nursing a Tennants at the Market Inn, a Bot scarf round his neck and a Rangers shirt on his back. \"I am a season ticket holder for both clubs,\" he says, making a distinction between senior and junior. Rab, a ed salesman, has been going to see both teams for decades. Talbots glory years, however, came when he was an adult.On the Market Inns wall is a wood plaque with each off the clubs dozen Junior Cup titles. First, , then all the rest since . Below is the legend, The Real Madrid of the Juniors and the curious phrase \"Eeka Peeka Pukka Po\". This, explains Rab, comes from a s deaf fan who could not quite manage to sing \"Well support you ever more.\" Instead of mocking or excluding the supporter, the crowd adopted his version.Behind the bar is landlord John Lyle,  and born and bred in Auchinleck and self-confessed \"Talbot diehard\". In pride of place, among his best spirits, is a little wooden mascot, called Eeka Peeka Pukka Po.Do any of his customers not support the team  He laughs. \"All of the lads are supporters. The club is the backbone of the town. It is all we have. If it wasnt for Talbot, we would not be on the map.\"John Lyle, picture by Colin MearnsTalbot preserves the spirit of a town, says councillorNEIL McGhee is, he says, an \"interlouper\".

Well, we have had it for  years, ever since the mines closed.\"Neil, in a black Auchinleck Talbot windcheater, is pointing out where there used to be shops in the towns heyday.When most people think of poverty or unemployment, reckons Neil, their minds turn to big cities and towns. And it is big cities and towns, he argues, that get the resources to fight deprivation.: Auchinleck manager urges team to stay focused\"Its hidden around here, the poverty,\" he says. \"Its forgotten. But I really worry about the young people. I worry about their mental health, that some of them give up.\"This is where football comes in.Shops decorated in buntingEverybody Neil passes says hello. The last few businesses on the street have bunting to match his jacket. Austerity aside, the mood in Auchinleck is good.\"The place is buzzing with excitement and expectation of another victory, a surprise victory,\" he says. \"The aspiration for many people is not very high and this game is one of the rare occasions when they get to be enjoy le without the worries of poverty.\"We are looking forward to a wonderful weekend and we will enjoy it regardless of the result.\"Neil McGheeNeil has been going to the football every since he arrived in the town. He has stood with the same friends for  years. He remembers losing a bet on the street when the Bot went down - in the late s.The club was not thriving when coal was. In fact, its biggest spells of success only came after the  strike that was the beginning of the end for Scottish mining.The secret of Talbots rise  Good management at a club run by its fans, reckons Neil. \"We are a small community and we are grateful to the committee for the long, long history they have of victory in junior cups and the west of Scotland league,\" he says.

It#s anticipated this work will start on February  and could take four weeks to complete.The current one-way system means drivers can turn into Castle Street from Junction Road and on into Broad Street but vehicles do not have access from Palace Road into Broad Street.A signed ersion via Clay Loan is in place. In addition, vehicles cannot turn into Castle Street from Albert Street – but can drive on into Broad Street.The works are part of the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative’sPlaces and Spaces project, which will see improvements to the area at the bottom of the Strynd, the creation of a new path to the War Memorial at St Magnus and improvements at the head of Victoria Street.The council has said the works at the top of Castle Street will see new paving and road surfacing laid, and the road surface raised to pavement level. This initial phase of the project is due for completion early May after which works will be suspended for the main summer season.Work at the entrance to Victoria Street is set to begin in the autumn, with a suspension planned, in December for Christmas shopping season.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority.

It was due to start its final phase of construction this year but it was axed from the councilrsquos capital programme in last yearrsquos budget.Then in March, funding for transport improvements in Dingwall was found to enable some housing development to take place prior to the commencement of the KLR.A transport study and modelling work considered the impact of ious levels of development in the town and improvements will include work at the Bridgend Avenue Junction and Docharty Road Junction as well as traffic signal works at Mart Road Junction. Proposals for walking and cycling improvements and traffic management measures will also be brought forward to enhance active travel facilities in the town.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Graham Mackenzie said: ldquoIt would be tempting to see it as a good news story for Dingwall. That is not the case. Had we been given what we were promised in an earlier iteration of the capital plan we could be releasing up to  houses for development instead of around .\"Instead the KLR was taken out of the capital plan even though the first phase of the project had already started. If Dingwall is to grow and provide the range of housing which is required, the KLR must be moved up the list of priorities.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/15_9_21-Barcelona-by-Xavier-Mercade-5-Copy.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

The knocker-up used a baton or short, heavy stick to knock on the clients doors or a long and light stick, often made of bamboo, to reach windows on higher floors. At least one of them used a pea-shooter!In , the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week. The knocker-up would not leave a clients window until they were sure that the client had been awoken.A knocker upper would also use a snuffer outer as a tool to rouse the sleeping. This implement was used to put out gas lamps which were lit at dusk and then needed to be extinguished at dawn.There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns. Generally the job was done by elderly men and women but sometimes police constables supplemented their pay by performing the task during early morning patrols.The pictures, re-discovered by areporter on a research task at the Local Studies Department of Ballymena Library appeared in the Belfast Newsletter in January of .

At only four-days-old Dáithí travelled to London where he underwent open heart surgery. Six days after that he underwent his second open heart operation.Máirtín described the stay as a “hard week” for his family and told the Andersonstown News that although Dáithí’s hearthasn’t declined, there had been slight damage done to his kidneys due to the high dosage of medicine the Ballymurphy toddler has to take.“It was a hard week for Dáithí, it was a hard week for us as well,” explained Máirtín. “There were constant needles, test after test for Dáithí but we got through it. The staff were amazing and the cardiologist seemed happy with Dáithí’s heartbut noticed some kidney damage.“Dáithí takes medicine for his heart, to help him go to the toilet he takes aspirin, around  doses of medicine in total a week. The hospital will be keeping an eye on it. Dáithi’s heartis okay at the minute and he is stable.“I know I speak for Seph and I when I say it was tough for us. When we first went over last year we have been educating ourselves ever since around organ donation and it’s got a lot more real. We were speaking to the surgeon who is going to be taking Dáithi’s heart out and eventually putting in a new one hopefully, it’s a lot more real,” he saidSince the family’s ‘Is Deontóír Mé Yes I Donate’ campaign began back in July, launched by Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey, there has been an increase of four per cent in the number ofpeople in the north who have opted into the organ donation register.Máirtín stressed how transplant is not a cure, but a last resort when all other options have been exhausted.“Seph and I came back from Newcastle saying we had to up the campaign, we have to keep raising awareness. When we were over we had to sign consent forms for the heart surgery for when Dáithí receives his gt, for the surgery to go ahead. You are basically siging a consent form with a list of risks and the first thing that it states is ‘death’ in capital letters and that’s jumping out of the page.“I did a radio interview this week and we were asked ‘so you are basically waiting for someone to die’ so that Dáithí can receive his gt – I said my son is dying, that’s the reality of it. We are desperate to help save his le and truly believe that awareness is key.”“Dáithí had his tube out for three months there and people thought he was fixed because he looks so well, people don’t always think he is sick.”An avid Paw Patrol and Liverpool FC fan, Máirtín and Seph spoke of how their son will continue to wait on the routine list. “He is stable enough to be at home,” explained Seph. “We asked the medical team over in Newcastle what are his chances of getting a heart on the routine list and there was little to none. It’s not impossible but it doesn’t happen that often. There are quite a few children around Dáithí’s weight and age that are unfortunately on the urgent list. We want to be at this stage because it means we are getting more time.”“You don’t want him to get worse but he is going to get worse,” added Máirtín. “While organ donation as a whole is up, hearts for children are down the last two years and that list is going up. As I said transplant is not a cure, transplant give you time. Everybody is dferent the first transplant baby in the UK is now in her ’s. The anxiety that Seph and I have will probably never go away. The last two years have been some of the best and worst times of our lives. We love Dáithí so much and will do anything to get as much time with him as possible.“We have put down hurdles, the first was getting to Newcastle, the second was getting Dáithí assessed, the third was getting him accepted onto the organ list and the next one is getting him a new heart. There will be lots after that but we’ve been taken it one wee step at a time. We would rather be on that rocky road than no road at all,” he said.A family health morning will take place on Saturday February  from -pm as part of Heart Awarnesss month at Glór na Móna.To register to become an organ donor visit: www.organdonation.nhs.uk register-to-donate register-your-details "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"catherine mcevoy to be named musician of the year","story":"FOR anyone who is familiar with Catherine McEvoy’s music it will come as no surprise to learn that she is to receive the Musician of the Year accolade at the upcoming TG Gradam Ceoil  in Belfast’s Waterfront Hall. As one of the leading concert flautists in Irish traditional music, recording success, TV and radio appearances and a considerable teaching contribution has marked her distinguished career. While Catherine is no stranger to critical acclaim, she says that she was “completely shocked” by the announcement of the award, which comes at a time in her le when she least expected it.Over the last  years Catherine has balanced her own music career alongside a teaching career at St Joseph’s School for Children with Visual Impairment and ChildVision in Dublin. By providing lessons and music therapies to students with multiple disabilities and visual impairment, she gives children a  for their talents and helps equip them with skills to improve their quality of le. The positive impact of Catherine’s work is undeniable but, admittedly, it allows her little time for her own music. Despite being a professional Catherine says she deals with her hectic schedule by treating her own music as a hobby.“I wouldn’t have loads of time for my own music, but I was never a full-time musician,” she explains.“Music was always a hobby for me. I would do some teaching at home, and I would do the Willie Clancy Summer School, and I would do some stuff in the States too. The funny thing about the trips away is that they’re almost like a holiday. “When you’re a professional musician you are under a certain amount of pressure all the time, but I’m lucky in the sense that I’m not because I still play my music in the way I want to play it – it’s something that I’ve always done and I love doing it. It’s still a hobby for me even though it takes up most of my le. I’d love to do a lot more playing for myself than I am, but sometimes work can get in the way.”In her family le, Catherine is also surrounded by music. Her husband Tom also plays the flute, while her three grown-up children, Jane, Ruairi and Fergus are accomplished musicians in their own right, but surprisingly, having grown up in Birmingham, Catherine says she herself hadn’t heard Irish traditional music until she was -years-old. However, it was in those musically formative years in the city that followed that she picked up the distinctive traditional music style of her parents’ native Roscommon, which she would become renowned for in the years to come.“My dad was more into football and my mum was a good ballad singer, she would’ve sang at parties and that,” she says.“I remember listening to Elvis and Clf Richards – we had those sort of records in the house when we were very very young, but not particularly traditional music. “It was only later when I was around eleven that I heard traditional music. I thought ‘oh, I like it’. Then my brother was away in boarding school learning classical fiddle and then he got into The Dubliners and started buying their records. That’s when the whole thing took off. “There was a prolic music scene in Birmingham, as there was in London, but it doesn’t get such a high profile. A lot of the big musicians gravitated towards London, but there was still a lot of great musicians in Birmingham, many of them from Roscommon, and there was lot of great musicians passing through. “Funnily enough I heard an interview with Finbar Furey recently where he was talking about playing in folk club in Birmingham run by a man called Mick Hipkiss – the Skillet Pop Club, and we actually used to play there. I remember seeing Finbar play there, and Christy Moore. I also remember the night when Mick Hipkiss announced this new group that had just been formed and were getting on the road called Planxty – that was back in the early s.”She continued: “A lot of County Roscommon players would travel to Birmingham. One of the first lady flute players I saw play was a woman called Peggy McGrath from County Roscommon and I was really taken with her style – that really spurred me on as well.“The Roscommon style, or the Sligo-Roscommon style, is a rhythmical, flowing sort of style as opposed to what they would call the Northern style,” she explains.“It’s slightly smoother and quite up-tempo. It’s something that I inherited. I wasn’t that I consciously decided to play in that style, it’s just because that was the flute playing that I heard. I’m self-taught and what you hear is what you learn.”Although Catherine says she inherited the Sligo-Roscommon style, she has made it her own indelible skill and fluency. Her recognition as the TG Gradam Ceoil  Musician of the Year undoubtedly encompasses a le-time of achievement, but having picked up a serious injury in her hand just over two years ago, she says it comes following a particularly low part of her career. While her musical ability has suffered as result of her injury, in some ways, the award could not have come at a better time.“Two years ago I had aspontaneous rupture in my right hand in part of my tendon, so I’m very lucky that I can still play,” Catherine says.“It took a lot to get over that I initially thought I wouldn’t be able to play again. I’ve actually had to change my hold on the flute slightly. Obviously the older you get the harder it is to recover, but it has taken a lot of mental anguish to get back to level of playing that I would be happy with. I’m probably only back to about  per cent – I’ll never be  per cent, which is sad in away because I had this idea of retiring and going off into the sunset playing for the rest of my le. I had just gotten over it, and then they go and give me a Gradam Ceoil.”She continued: “It was the biggest shock I ever got in my le. It was massive boost, especially coming from a very low part of my le two or three years ago and sort of clawing my way back. “There are probably loads of other people out there who deserve it, but it’s a great thing and I’m really honoured. I’m delighted and to get an award for something that you’ve been doing for most of your le, something that you get pleasure out of doing, is a great bonus.”She adds: “It’ll be wonderful. It does come with a certain amount of pressure because it’s live TV. I’m the type of person who doesn’t really know how to handle the limelight, but I suppose a lot of Irish people are like that. But it is great, and I’ve had so much good will, which sometimes you don’t realise because you live in a bubble where you think people aren’t thinking about you and then you are showered with all of this good will. That’s nice, and the traditional music community are great.” Gradam recipients, who represent the crème de la crème of traditional music and song, will be joined in live performances on stage by their own special musical guests, including Irish fiddler Paddy Glackin, Michael McCague and multi-instrumentalist Sinéad Egan, to name but a few. A range of VIP guest presenters will also take to the stage last year, actor Stephen Rea and President Michael D. Higgins were amongst the VIP guests at the event.Tickets for the February th TG Gradam Ceoil Awards , priced from £., are available from www.waterfront or +  ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reflecting on pat finucanes legacy","story":"A SPECIAL event to reflect on the le and legacy of Pat Finucane is to be held at StMary’s University College on Sunday.Organised by Féile an Phobail, the event is being held to mark the upcoming th anniversary of the prominent human rights lawyer, who was murdered by British state-backed loyalist death squad in his home on February , .Mr Finucane’s son, John Finucane, who is also a solicitor, will be joined by Gerry Adams as they reflect on the legacy of his father’s death and work.Speaking ahead of Sunday’s event, John said it will also offer a chance to share personal memories of his father, who he fondly remembers as a fun-loving “messer”.“It was just before my ninth birthday when he was killed, but I always remember kicking a ball with him,” he said.“He was a good soccer player and would have played at a fairly good level in the Irish League and Amateur League. People still talk about him, and I don’t think there is that much rose-tinted glasses, as there can be when people aren’t about any more, but he was a very successful forward and good goal-scorer, and I remember kicking a ball with him in the back garden and going to games with him.“I remember the house being very busy with phonecalls and taking messages. I also remember going on holidays – we used to go camping every summer – so I have all of those good memories.”He continued: “He was a messer. He would have wound me up, he would have wound my brother and my sister up, and he would have been good fun about the house.“The older I get the more I appreciate it more from doing this type of job – although he would have been doing it in a dferent context than me – but I imagine that it would have brought a lot stress and challenges and I suppose going back to the house and winding the kids up and having a bit of craic was a way to unwind.”John was present with the rest of his family when loyalist gunmen broke into their Fortwilliam Drive home and murdered his father as they sat down to Sunday dinner. The “brutal” murder is still “very clear” to him as it changed his family’s lives forever. The proceeding years would be marked by the campaign for justice as they took on the British state.“I don’t even think I appreciate how taxing the campaign has been,” John admits.“My le growing up has been in the context of making allegations of collusion against the state in a time, from the early s onwards where the word collusion was a dirty word you were a republican propagandist. That was my normality.“It has taken me until my later years to appreciate that my mother was raising three kids, she was going to work and getting children up to get them ready for school, getting breakfast lunch and dinner ready – doing all of that having lost her husband. It has taken me a few years to realise the impact that it had on her, and that makes me appreciate and admire her a lot more than I already did.”Pat Finucane’s case is still under review by The Supreme Court as his family continue to fight for an inquiry. Asked about the signicance of the campaign for other victims of state violence, John said: “Something we have said from the very beginning of our campaign is that this apparatus and this policy that the British state had, which resulted in the deaths and the murders of so many people here, wasn’t just about Pat Finucane. They didn’t set this up just to kill my dad they killed people before him and they killed people after him.“I think it has been an example of what you can achieveyou are persistent and you have that support around you. We weren’t just a family, we had the support of NGOs, we had the support of investigative journalists, we had the support of governments and politicians. Whilst it hasn’t delivered in an inquiry, it has resulted in the word collusion having a very dferent context – people now accept that it happened and there is no longer a ‘few rotten apples in the barrel theory’ and it is no longer ‘republican propaganda’.”He continued: “The support that people have given us over the years, it’s very hard to put that into words. Whether it’s people talking about their memories of my father, people having encouraging words about our campaign, or attending events like this one in St Mary’s, it really provides us so much support.“It’s very humbling and we have always been grateful and we will remain truly grateful for that. My father came from a community that had very little and he wanted to use his education to make people’s lives much better, so for people to come out to remember and pay tribute to him means an awful lot to me and my family.”Sunday’s event will be held at pm in St Mary’s University College, Falls Road."},{"url":null,"title":"500 jobs safe and belfast house of fraser to get","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, unionist councillors voted down the motion, which would also have resulted in a council presence at the annual Belfast Pride Parade in August. Members of the DUP and Ulster Unionists rejected the plan and said they would not be taking lectures on equality from Sinn Fein. Last August, Sinn Fein spearheaded an attempt to fly rainbow flags on the councils premises to show support to LGBTQ+ citizens during Pride.Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon was set to make history by becoming the first council in Northern Ireland to fly the Pride flag above its three civic buildings.But the DUP invoked the call-in mechanism, which allows decisions to be reconsideredat least % of councillors request it.The DUP said strict procedures on flying flags and emblems hadnt been followed properly.The council then sought legal advice, which both the DUP and Sinn Fein claimed justied their stance. The row meant Pride Day last August passed without the flags in place. People taking part in the Belfast Pride parade set off from Custom House Square in central Belfast. Michael Cooper PA WireSinn Fein council group leader Darren McNally told the Ulster Gazette newspaper it was disappointing but not surprising that both unionist parties had voted against lighting up the civic buildings. He said: \"We have a erse community and the onus is on us to ensure we not only represent minority groups such as our LGBT community but that we make them feel valued, included, welcome and safe. \"Lighting up the civic buildings on Pride Day and an official presence at the parade is a forward-moving gesture - small but signicant - which would send out a clear message that ABC council are here for our LGBT community at a time when they are subject to hate attacks and left feeling isolated. \"In amending our original motion of the flying of the Pride flag, we were recognising that some parties are on a journey with regards to this particular issue. Other unionist councillors have supported similar motions in other councils.\"However, UUP councillor Jim Speers hit out at what he called the \"mischievous\" motion. He said: \"Sinn Feins actions go counter to the good working relationships we need at ABC Council. \"They are the last party that should be giving lectures on the need for equality. For a party which was linked to an organisation which terrorised this community for over  years to be talking about equality is disgusting.\"The DUPs Gareth Wilson accused Sinn Fein of \"blatant electioneering\". He added: \"Given the ious and well publicised anti-DUP messages associated with the event in question, our party grouping decided unanimously to decline support for this latest Sinn Fein motion.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"very real chance of united ireland vote following nodeal brexit say government ministers","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

tycoon also allegedly dragged a woman around in a headlock and smashed a male employee’s mobile phone, the newspaper said.Details of the allegations against Sir Philip involving five employees were revealed online by theafter his legal action against the paper ended at the High Court earlier on Friday.Sir Philip has categorically denied the allegations, insisting he never meant to cause offence.Saturdays Dailyfront page: The claims against Green #tomorrowspaperstoday pic imWGczk— The February , Earlier on Friday he accused the paper of “pursuing a vendetta” against him and his staff and said former employees whose allegations were investigated by the newspaper were under “ongoing obligations” to honour non-disclosure agreements .Lawyers representing Sir Philip told the : “It is further denied that any of Sir Philip’s conduct towards employees amounted to any type of crime, or anything that would amount to gross misconduct, or a serious risk to health and safety.”Thesaid the Arcadia boss paid out millions in settlements with staff members, who include a senior female executive who was allegedly called a “naughty girl” by Sir Philip.The newspaper said he allegedly kissed her face on a number of occasions, slapped her bottom and made comments about her weight.According to the , Sir Philip also allegedly drew attention to the dreadlocks of a senior male executive in front of other staff, and referred to him “throwing spears in the jungle”.And the paper reported he was told not to come any closer by a woman whose face he is said to have grabbed, allegedly dragged another senior female staff member around in a headlock and allegedly smashed a male staff member’s mobile phone in an aggressive dressing down.The court injunction was first sought after Sir Philip and an executive at his Arcadia firm were contacted by ajournalist in July last year.The newspaper intended to publish allegations of misconduct made against Sir Philip by the employees – who all received substantial payments after settling their claims.In all five cases, the employees had agreed to keep the details of their complaints confidential under NDAs.Sir Philip obtained the injunction, but last week it emerged that he  was dropping the case because it was “pointless” after he was named in Parliament as the businessman behind an injunction against the newspaper.Lawyers representing the Topshop owner said the decision was prompted by Lord Hain’s identication of Sir Philip in the House of Lords in October last year, a day after theran a front-page story saying it was prevented from naming a “mystery businessman”.In a ruling in London on Friday, Mr Justice Warby granted Sir Philip and two of his companies permission to discontinue the proceedings – which was needed because of the injunction.However, the judge declined to impose conditions to stop Sir Philip and the companies suing either theor the former employees in future, as requested by the newspaper.In his judgment, the judge said lawyers representing thehad said Sir Philip’s “unlawful” conduct was “sufficiently serious to engage the public interest, including as it does unwanted contact of a sexual nature general sexual harassment racist language and intimidation and bullying many amounting to criminal offences, and all having serious consequences for employees in particular for their health and wellbeing”."},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say february","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix

Fortunately, the plane was able to circle back around and land safely after the “go around” manoeuvre was performed.Scott Bateman, chief executive of -Line Aviation and a retired member of the Royal Air Force, went on Twitter to explain the necessity of the manoeuvre, and why it was the safest option for the aircraft. He explained: “This is a professional team making the correct decision to go around after an approach is destabilised by a gust. “A practised and entirely safe manoeuvre.” During extremes of weather it’s likely the Captain will plan to land the aircraft, to utilise their experience  exposure to these events. This increases the likelihood of landing but is never a guarantee. The team will always work to their parameters set in the brief #StormErik pic rhJdMBOWD— Scott BatemanFebruary , Mr Bateman said: “Most approaches start an long way from the airfield. “The pilots will get the weather and assess the likely ‘threats’. “In the case of wind they will verbalise and practice manoeuvres such as a go around as well as setting acceptable and safe parameters for the day.“There is no point in continuing to landyou haven’t touched down in the correct place. “To do so would be unwise and it’s safer to go around.”Did you know that the pilots can execute a go around even after landing  This is an entirely safe  practiced manoeuvre.

These standard quality checks are carried out every three months, in line with UK best practice.The Western Trust said it immediately set up a review team, alerted the Public Health Agency and Department of Health and initiated the review process.  As a result of the review, a total of  women have been asked to arrange repeat smear test with their GP.Of the  women affected,  of them are from the Western Trust area,  women from the Belfast and South Eastern Trust areas and  women from the Republic of Ireland.Dr Dermot Hughes, Medical Director of the Western Trust, said: “The women affected will have received letters inviting them to contact their GP to arrange a repeat smear test. This does not necessarily mean that the results of their initial test were wrong the repeat test is a precautionary measure to provide reassurance that all women are being followed up appropriately.“I understand that this may cause worry and inconvenience for the women affected and I sincerely apologise for this.

projects that were agreed in its current four-year corporate plan which ends in , working to improve the local authorityrsquos recycling rates, both for blue and brown bin collections, reducing the amount of waste going to landfill by %.Mr Hannaway said the council was also delighted to open the new poundm Down Leisure Centre which he described as a ldquosignature project that will make a real contribution to improving citizensrsquo health and wellbeing.ldquoWe are even more ambitious for the coming year, with the agreement on funding for the Belfast Region City Deal, we have plans for a new conference and theatre facility in Newry City, the delivery of the Southern Relief Road and a -year programme of economic growth, the chief executive continued.ldquoThe reopening of the Warrenpoint Municipal Park in August and the opening of the Carlingford Lough Greenway from Newry to Victoria Lock in July demonstrate our councilrsquos commitment to improving our arearsquos attractions and environment.Mr Hannaway said that in the coming year Newry and its Cathedral Corridor would see pound, for improvements, festive lighting and events, to building on what has already been achieved in these locations.His focus also turned to Brexit, explaining that as the March  deadline for leaving edges ever closer, the councilrsquos relationships with government departments, the EU, cross border bodies and institutions across Ireland and Britain will become even more important as it seeks to improve the district.ldquoThese partnerships will remain a priority for the coming year as we deliver initiatives, programmes and services for all the people living, working and investing in our district, he continued.ldquoSome of the projects that will be progressed during the   year include further revitalisation of Warrenpoint, with pound, for town improvements, including shop fronts, new signage and a promotional and marketing campaign.ldquoThe council has also secured approval for the Ballynahinch bypass, a plan that will greatly improve access throughout the area and relieve the traffic congestion in the town centre.Mr Hannaway said plans for the southern relief road in Newry will be progressed after the preferred route was announced and was confident that developing a strategic link road between the A Dublin Road and the A Warrenpoint Road mdash a project that the council is working on with Stormont officials ndash will contribute to increasing the economy of the whole region.He said improving public services and the way they were implemented was another important goal for the council in the new financial year, revealing that five ambitious performance improvement objectives had been identied.They include encouraging healthy lestyles, improving economic growth and promoting the district as a premier tourist destination, delivering urban and rural regeneration initiatives, creating a cleaner, greener district, and encouraging and empowering local communities to work with the Council to deliver on its programmes.ldquoOver the coming months, the council will be working with local groups to ensure that their views on how best to implement these important goals, he confirmed.ldquoOver the coming year, the historic town of Downpatrick will benefit from a new public realm improvement scheme as part of the Masterplan which will be delivered in partnership with the Department for Communities and the Department for Infrastructure.Mr Hannaway said the district continued to benefit from EU funding, with pound.m being provided to South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which promotes economic growth and job creation in coastal and inland communities.Under the PEACE IV programme pound.m had been allocated to the council to deliver the Local Authority Action PlanmdashBeyond Tolerance in the three key areas of children and young people, shared spaces and services, and building positive relationships.Projects funded under

of the table to nine points when they condemned Killough to the also rans category at The Links, Strangford on Saturday.Killough, who have been forced go play their home games anywhere they can as the Mill Field undergoes further repairs, could easily have collected three points with a resolute second half display, but Ballynagross closed up shop after taking - lead at the end of the first half.Both sides settled quickly with the excellent playing surface encouraging players to keep the ball on the floor. It was Ballynagross, who didnrsquot seem to miss the suspended Matthew Rooney and Declan Dowie too much, that drew first blood in the fth minute.The dashing Eoin Rooney, who was making his first team debut following a recent move from Downpatrick FC, took full advantage of a failed offside call from Killough, sped past Stevie Laverty and beat new lsquokeeper Peter Kelly with a clinical finish.Killough retaliated immediately with Michael Burns, Gareth George and Tony McIhone prodding patiently from the middle of the park and when an opening came, Declan Looney, a team-mate of Eoin Rooney at Downpatrick not that long ago, put the burners on and rled a sweet equaliser past Conor McCullough, a former Killough lsquokeeper, from just inside the box.As expected from a derby clash, no quarter was asked or given and it took a few yellow cards to bring the combatants under control before Daniel Taggart popped up in the box to restore the visitorsrsquo lead with a poacherrsquos finish.Killough tried to get back on level terms with Freddie OrsquoConnor raiding down the flank and Ross Armstrong working overtime in a bid to create something of note. However, a Ballynagross back four of Conor Marron, John Shields, Aaron Beattie and Gary Carberry were in dominant form and they steadfastly refused to give way.Karl Gelstonrsquos side was more than happy to hit Killough on the break and midway through the first half, assassin Donal McCavera gave them a - lead as Killough were caught chasing the game.Killough had to throw caution to the wind and pulled a goal back just before the break when the dangerous McIlhoneexploded into le when he drilled in a beauty to give his side every chance of getting a result.The second half, although as equally as combative, never reached the dizzy heights of the first  minutes with two well-matched sides cancelling each other out in a midfield war of attrition.Chances were few and far between with the respective defences on top. Killough again did the chasing, but there was just no way past Carberry and Beattie and lsquokeeper McCullough did all that was asked of him.The longer the game went on, the deeper Ballynagross defended, but in the final analysis, Killough just didnrsquot have the necessary firepower to break them down.Killough: Peter Kelly, Colm Kearney, Stevie Laverty, Jason Clarke, Kevin Groves, Tony McIlhone, Michael Burns, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Declan Looney, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George.

It literally became a tidal wave of women going, lsquoYes Me Too, Yes Me Too, Yes Me Toorsquo.ldquoSexual assault is everywhere.It has been normalised. It has been accepted. Until we are shining a proper light on this, we need this to happen.ldquoIt has always been that way. Where did the phrase the casting coach come from  It is as old as the hills.

He has a proud direct lineage to the band when it first started out  years ago. His great-uncle, James Strain of Woodgrange, was the bandrsquos first pipe major.He also has pipes dating back to the early days of the band, a much-prized piece of heritage along with the framed photographs of former pipe band members and lodge members which line the walls of the Orange Hall.James Strain was taught by the bandrsquos first piping instructor, William Maxwell from Newcastle, who used to travel by train to Tullymurry on the Ballydugan Road and then arrive by bicycle or horse and cart to the hall.Sammy, who joined the band when he was seven, says, as do other members, that his introduction into the pipe band world was a natural extension of his family le.ldquoIt was actually my cousin who taught me the pipes even though my father Sam was pipe major at the time, he said.ldquoI joined in  and played my first Twelfth in Newcastle in  when I was nine. At that time I was playing whatrsquos called a three-quarter set of pipes.ldquoI canrsquot remember being askedI wanted to join but as my great-grandfather was one of the first members, it was just in the family. It was just handed down, it was taken for granted, more or less, that you were going to learn the pipes.ldquoWhen we started out, there really was nothing  so the band was number one. Itrsquos dficult now to keep a band going with so many other things for the young ones to be doing, so how we managed to keep a band going  years, I do not know.From head to toe, it can cost from between pound to pound, to kit out an adult pipe band member in full unorm and around pound for child members.The unorm has always represented a major investment mdash in addition to practice and competition timemdash for any member.In his history of the band on its th anniversary, Sammy recounted the lower end of a quotation given for a new unorm in  coming in at  pounds  shillings, which is equivalent to around pound today.The retired farmer has been with the band during the worst and the best of times.ldquoWe went through a lean period in the late Eighties and we werenrsquot contesting then. We started contesting in  and then again about five or six years ago, he said.ldquoThe best time of the band I can recall was in  when I retired as pipe major. My cousin, Francey Strain, took the band over and as we had a lot of young ones then, those were the best years up until  where we went to the World Pipe Band Championships in Cowal and we were upgraded three times in that time.The best of times for Hollymount was when they came runners-up in their grade B at the World Championships on their first entry into the competition.Ronnie Steele recalls: ldquoWe were very nearly not going but decided at the last minute so it was a real rush to try and book the boat and to find somewhere for us all to stay.Hollymount achieved their biggest achievement to date on one of the blackest days in Northern Ireland history mdash the day of the Omagh bombing on August ,.While the band continued throughout the  years of the Troubles, it emerged unscathed, according to Ronnie, who adds: ldquoThrough all the Troubles we had never any bother down here we never missed anything out.Another strong family connection belongs to pipe major Sam Gill ndash whose maternal uncle is Sammy Strain. His two sons, Jackand seven year-old Charlie, are in the band. When the  year-old isnrsquot at the band or at work as a mechanic, he continues to perfect his skill as a former world ploughing champion and the winner of the NI title for  years.ldquoMy father, Raymond, played in the band as did my twin brother, David, who now plays for Drumlough Pipe Band.ldquoWhen I joined at the age of eight, it was just a matter in those days that after my father came home from work and got a bit of dinner, he would have say, rsquoRight, I take you up to the bandrsquo.ldquoSammy Strain taught me the notes on a blackboard whereas now you have the likes of Ronniersquos daughter, Christie, who records me on her phone playing and she practice.Ronnie shares his love of the band with daughters Christie , Ashleyand three year-old Megan. No doubt his youngest, one year-old Alexandra, will be drafted in a few years time.Piper Ryan Green, who used to play for the former Seaforde and Woodgrange Pipe Bands, has also introduced his  year-old son, Matthew, while piper Robert Neill plays alongside his  year-old daughter Laura.Sometimes the pull towards piping and Hollymount misses a generation.

We have more quality control on our beef and that is what makes it high grade. This leaves us in a very dficult position because we cannot produce our beef for any less than we already do.ldquoOur fear is that, in the event of a lsquono dealrsquo and there isnrsquot enough UK beef to satisfy demand, they will look at bringing in beef from outside of the UK. If itrsquos brought in at a cheaper price it could very well leave us in a tight spot.Mr Rice, whose family has been in farming for generations, continued: ldquoBeef and lamb have been subsidised by the EU indirectly in the form of Single Farm Payments. Dairy, pork and chicken are already at world prices and can already compete. They will not see such a big fluctuation whereas we will be more exposed.ldquoIf Prime Minister Teresa May were to step in and take over the subsidies, the outlook looks favourable in the short term.ldquoBut when a boat load of beef comes in from Brazil then almost certainly subsidies will be reduced and wersquoll be paid to maintain the landscape. In other words wersquoll be reduced to gardeners.Describing Brexit as the ldquobiggest peacetime emergency in almost a century, Ballynahinch farmer Barry Higgins said the uncertainty of the situation did not do farmers any favours.ldquoWe feel itrsquos more of a back lash than a back stop, he remarked, adding that he hoped no farmers would be forced out of business.Dessie Canavan, from Kilcoo, said farmers were being ldquodragged into Brexit against their will.ldquoIt is unfair for us to compete against the likes of Brazil and Argentina, he remarked. ldquoDepending on the size of our farm, sometimes we are forced out into part-time jobs to subsidise our income. And thatrsquos before Brexit comes into force. There is much to be concerned about.A spokesman for Downpatrick Co Operative Marketing Ltd said its role was to respect the views of all its shareholders and customers, who are farmers.He added: ldquoOur business relies solely on the trading of livestock both locally and outside Northern Ireland and we are therefore concerned about the impact Brexit will have on our daily business and the local faming community we serve.ldquoAs part of a democratic society we respect the peoplersquos vote to leave the EU, but we are also aware the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain.ldquoWe now have a situation with two main options mdash either crash out or negotiate a deal to leave. Our main fear with the crash out option is that it exposes us all to a greater risk of casualties rather than survivors.ldquoOver the past  months Teresa May has been trying tirelessly to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU that represents and respects all the people within the UK.The spokesman said: ldquoAll we ask is the same respect is given to any deal which identies and supports the uniqueness of trading and faming in Northern Ireland. Businesses and farmers are very good at adapting to change in whatever form it comes but at present, with no clear decision on Brexit, the ongoing development of any business has been affected.The Ulster Farmersrsquo Union is also concerned at the prospect of a lsquono dealrsquo Brexit UFU president Ivor Ferguson added: ldquoWe respect the referendum result and that the UK will leave the EU. However, the uncertainty is very damaging.ldquoWith March  less than  days away decisions need to be taken urgently and a deal agreed. Leaving the EU without a deal would be catastrophic for Northern Irelandrsquos farming families and their businesses.ldquoNo deal means high tarfs on our exports creating an effective trade embargo and the possibility of lower standard imports flooding the UK market.ldquoThese practical issues will have an immediate and profound impact on farmers, causing major disruptions to the supply chain, crippling the industry and rendering our farmers uncompetitive..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 6%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch headmaster hit out at the education authorities this week for the lack of permanent accommodation at his school where two thirds of the pupils are in wooden huts.Mr Harry Bent said St Colmanrsquos High School had been promised a major extension, but was unlikely to get it ldquoas long as comprehensive education is the policy of the Government.Speaking at the schoolrsquos annual prize day, Mr Bent said it angered him that the provision of accommodation had not kept pace with the growing numbers and successes of pupils.ldquoIn St Colmanrsquos nine temporary classrooms accommodate  pupils out of a total of , he said. ldquoThis means that almost two thirds of our pupils are in temporary accommodation which was first erected as a temporary measure ten years ago.Mr Bent stressed temporary classrooms may solve a financial problem for the Government, but there was so substitute for normal school accommodation.ldquoAt least  of the  subjects on the secondary curriculum are practical subjects, such as domestic science.

The only exception would be when sensitive information is being discussed, he said. ldquoNo reasoning was given as to why the CIL visit should have been in private.Councillor Dermot Curran said the event should have been held in the ldquofull glare of the public and asked why more meetings were now being arranged mdash at the ratepayersrsquo expense mdash when one open to all councillors, the press and the public would have been sufficient.Slieve Croob councillor John Rice also expressed concern that only elected representatives were able to hear from the Commissioners.ldquoThis meeting was about a lighthouse and it was ridiculous that the public, in particular those campaigning to retain the beam, were not permitted to listen to the debate, he added.Cllr Cadogan Enright, whose proposal that reporters and the public should have been admitted was defeated, believes there was no reason to exclude them. He claimed the attitude of ldquohiding what was going on in council was becoming too common and needed to be stopped.ldquoTransparency in council is the best way to win public trust, he declared. ldquoThe Commissioners said they are not proposing to take away the existing apparatus except for the mercury bath. They propose putting a new rotating LED beam on the top of the lighthouse to demonstrate that they were listening to local people and plan to bring this all to consultation later in the year.Cllr Enright said the Commissioners confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Council could bring forward a partnership with a local preservation group in a manner similar to what happened at Loop Head lighthouse in Co Clare.A council spokesman said: ldquoThis workshop was a preliminary information session for councillors and prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation is planned, he said.The spokesman added: ldquoCouncillors present also agreed to invite officers from the Commissioner of Irish Lights to a joint DEA Forum meeting to ensure information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Magical Mooney conjures up late%2C late winner  ","story":"DOWN were forced to rely on an eleventh hour intervention from Caolan Mooney to get over the line at Connolly Park, Sligo, on Sunday.The Rostrevor governor swooped in added time to turn a - to - deficit into a winning scenario with a sensational last-gasp goal to give Paddy Tallyrsquos charges their first win of the campaign.It all looked so bleak for the visitors for most of the game as Sligo dominated the exchanges, but Down hung on grimly and Mooney saved the day four minutes into added time.Sligo started in a hurry and points from Pat Hughes and Liam Gaughan gave the hosts a - to - lead after five minutes.Hughes slammed in a quick goal to increase Sligorsquos lead to five points before Paul Devlin registered Downrsquos first score with a converted free in the eighth minute.Further unanswered points from Pat Havern and Ryan and Jerome Johnston brought Down to within a point of the home side midway through the first half.

It is also hoped to provide a storage and work area and space for the community to use.Cllr Curran said many people were eager to read the conclusions of the government departmentrsquos review, particularly in the context of a post-Brexit scenario.He added: ldquoAt this point in time all those within the fishing sector in particular are looking at the ongoing discussions around Brexit and wondering what any final decision will have on an already heavily regulated industry.Meanwhile, Ardglass Golf Club is the venue for a special event next Wednesday, February , when funding opportunities under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund support programme will be outlined during an information session which runs between am and .pm.The funding initiative is designed to support a broad range of projects that focus on promoting economic growth through job creation and social inclusion in coastal and inland communities which depend on fishing and aquaculture.This includes the ersication of activities within fisheries and into other sectors of the maritime economy with the pound.m funding cake being administered by the South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which comprises representatives from the public, private and voluntary sectors within the Newry, Mourne and Down and Ards and North Down council areas.The projects eligible for financial support must must demonstrate how they will impact on fishing dependent communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Spa’s James and Kirsty dance to success  ","story":"YOUNG farmers from all over Co Down descended upon a Belfast hotel recently for this yearrsquos star-studded grand final of Strictly Young Farmers.More usually associated with Simmentals and Shorthorns the Strictly contestants showed they were equally at home with a good salsa or a samba on stage at the Crown Plaza Hotel in a bid to win the much revered glitter ball.The event sponsored by Barclays, saw Young Farmersrsquo clubs from all over Co Down welcome a crowd of over , made up of sponsors, family and friends, to support this yearrsquos dancers.The enthusiastic audience were dazzled with a vast array of steps and styles including the cha cha cha, jive, charleston, paso doble and American smooth.In preparation for the big night the committed couples underwent a strict regime every Monday evening since last November.Following much swinging, sweat and a lot of fake tan the couples were well able to showcase their talent at the annual event to raise funds for Alzheimerrsquos Society and local Young Farmersrsquo clubs.The event was hosted by past YFCU president Roberta Simmons, of Rathfriland YFC, past YFCU vice-president Harry Crosby, of Spa YFC, and current YFCU vice-president Andrew Patton, from Newtownards YFC.Assisting with the eveningrsquos entertainment were judges Karen Patterson from the BBC and past Young Farmer, James Trotman, Agri Manager for Barclays, Janet Plunkett, Fundraising Manager for Alzheimerrsquos Society in Northern Ireland, and Zita McNaugher, current YFCU deputy president.Competing couples George Porter and Laura Sproule, Matthew Ney and Rebecca Nelson, Chris Reid and Sarah Robinson, Harry Walker and Emma Connolly, James Gilpin and Emma McAnea, Ward Patterson and Sarah Reid, Richard Kennedy and Jessica Lee, Harry Hamilton and Louise McAnea, Graham Annett and Sarah Graham wowed the crowd with their twinkle toes.However, it was James McCauley and Kirsty Burrows, from Spa YFC, who danced their way to the top with their energetic charleston to be crowned Strictly winners .The organising committee, led by Co Down YFC chairperson Linzi Stewart and secretary Kristina McKeag, thanked everyone who helped make the night such a success, particularly sponsors, hosts, judges, family and friends and last but not least the dancers, who were the stars of the show..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17390851.karen-and-greg-tie-the-knot-and-are-set-to-do-it-all-again-down-under/resources/images/9400152.jpg","title":"outstanding quality at second calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

They immediately ordered my Men on board their Ship, and sent  of theirs, and a Lieutenant, on board ours who immediately demanded all the Keys of my Chests, Srutores, c. They began to rummage, but found nothing in my Chests, but in a Passenger’s Chest they found four or five Pieces of Eight, upon which they declared that she was the King of Spain’s lawful Prize but afterwards they found one Stick of Logwood: This was all they found to make a Prize of her though they told methey found nothing, they would carry her into Port andthe Governor thought fit to clear her, he might.I was immediately ordered out of the Ship, with all the People, and put on board their Man of War, which in a few Days arrived at the Havannah, and the Prize in about eight or nine Days after. Upon her Arrival, I heard that they had found the Money I had hid in a Water Cask, but they gave an Account of no more than  Pieces of Eight but I had on board , and upwards so the Officers and Men stole the rest. The Ship was brought into Porte in the most Ignominious Manner they could think of, with the Ensign half Mast, and the Union downwards.I was detained  Days on board a Man of War closely confined, but afterwards had the Liberty of walking about on Parole. The Ship had been put up to Sale about a Week before I left Havannah: The most that was bid for her was  Pieces of Eight. The Cargo they sold one amongst another for about a tenth Part of the Value, viz. Sugar at four Reals per C. the rest in Proportion, for they say,they are obliged to make Restitution, they can pay no more than the Amount of this sham Sale. I sail’d from the Havannah in October, bound for this Place, and thought to be clear when I got here but they have put me into this Castle, where I am closely confined, notwithstanding all the Intercession the Consul made, who offered the Governour to be bound for my Appearance in any penal Sum he thought proper but that Favour could not be obtain’d, for no other Reason that I know of, unless it is because I was born in Great Britain.When I was taken, they took all my Clothes, and Linen, except what I had on my Back they even took my Watch out of my Pocket. It is my Opinion, that Manesto’s, Memorials, and Representations cannot heal these Wounds, nor put a stop to their Proceedings: Immedicabile Vulnus Ense rescindendum est. For as soon as the Admiral at the Havannah would sail for Cartagena, there was another Armada, consisting of a Sloop, and two Half Galleys, to be sent out with  Men to hunt the English, as they term it.It is impossible for me to be in every Respect particular, for it would take more Room than the Compass of a Letter would admit of but the few Hints here wrote, will give some Idea of the Treatment Englishmen meet with abroad from these People. I have wrote by this Post to the English Minister at the Court of Madrid. The Consul here took my Declaration Yesterday, which he also transmits to Madrid.He firmly believes, I shall have full Satisfaction for both Ship and Cargo, which I valu’d at nine Thousand Pounds sterling: Andyou represent this to the British Court before I come Home, I desire you will put the like Value, for I can make it appear that she consisted of that Value. Thus far I can venture to say, thatever there is Restitution made for these Depredations, your Chance is much fairer than others, being taken by a Man of War, all other Vessels having been taken by Guarda Costa’s.I am,GENTLEMEN,Your most Obedient Servant,JASON VAUGHAN.[Much of the middle section of this letter is missing in the surviving News Letter copy, due to a huge tear in the paper. However, the same letter from Mr Vaughan is reproduced in The Political State of Great Britain Volume LVII, a journal, for the first half of , so it is possible to fill in the gaps.A Piece of Eight is a Spanish dollar, roughly worth a British pound.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them. This is on top of the response from local people.\"I spent most of my evenings in that first week doing deliveries all over Penarth,\" Mr Lewis added.Through the sales, Mr Lewis has raised more than pound, for the Alzheimers Society.He said: \"It seemed like the right thing to do really, as Penarth is a very community-oriented town so doing a calendar for charity fits with the outlook of the people of Penarth.\"Now, Mr Lewis is looking at printing more calendars this year to help raise further funds for the charity.\"If the idea of this calendar had never been suggested then my photos would have ended up just sitting on my computer,\" he said.\"Irsquom just glad that this hobby that I really like has ended up being put to good use by raising this money for charity.To get in touch with Mr Lewis about purchasing a calendar, email philip.lewis@live article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop.

Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A consultation is being held on the councilrsquo website, while a drop-in session was held atSt Augustinersquos Parish Hall on January . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mark, who is a double kidney transplant recipient, first received a transplant back in  but in January  that transplanted kidney sadly began to shut down.The programme chronicles how mum Jo-Anne, now Northern Ireland Ambassador for national kidney patient charity Kidney Care UK, put herself forward to donate her kidney through the renal unit at the Belfast City Hospital. Commenting on taking part in the BBC documentary Jo-Anne said: “Last March Mark and I literally placed our lives in the hands of heroes! The renal unit and it’s amazing staff hold a very special place in our hearts and we were absolutely thrilled to be part of this important documentary which has the power to inspire and to save lives through promoting the organ donation message. “The cameras followed us on our visits to the renal and transplant units at the City Hospital and Daisy Hill Hospital, as well as attending a very emotional organ donation service in Botanic Gardens and, at home and on our family farm.“Looking back it doesn’t seem anything like a year since we had our surgery and to see Mark looking so well makes it all worth while!It’s hugely important to us to continue to promote a message of hope and that’s why teaming up with Stephen Watson in this way to share our story and to let people see behind-the-scenes of our transplant journey means so much to us. Mark is one of the lucky ones because sadly not everyone has the opportunity to receive that gt of le through organ donation and this vital message is very much highlighted within the program. “Being a part of this BBC documentary was very important for both Mark and myself.

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"uncertainty interconnectors and the future of ni energy post brexit","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business With a potential ‘no deal’ around the corner on Brexit, what will that mean for the future of Northern Ireland’s energy policy – especially on renewables, the I-SEM all-island market and power generation  John Simpson takes a closer look On the last working day before Christmas , the System Operator for Northern Irelandpublished draft proposals of how the electricity systems and grids on this island may operate in -. Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house_11.jpg","title":"future of house of fraser in belfast secured amid fresh lease","story":"Posted on Friday February  by John Mulgrew The future of House of Fraser in Belfast appears to be safe after the retailer signed a fresh lease on its anchor store at Victoria Square, it can be revealed.
