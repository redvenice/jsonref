He did pretty well to get into the side, I reckon – I doubt he expected to – but there was no one else, and they thought the pitches suited his game. In general, it’s hard to know where England go from here – you could make cases for this to be it for him, Burns and Buttler – but who comes in?  “More amapiano on the OBO please!” emails Gil Southwood. “Been a huge fan of Mas Musiq since I heard my neighbour blasting them out his window two years ago. Where do you put England’s chances of a win here? I’ve just woken up in a covid-riddled fugue state to 68-1, but with the openers actually doing their job, 271 seems doable. Maybe it’s the covid driving my optimism, who knows.” By West Indies there’ll be a Spotify playlist, I promise – I do have one already, but it’s interpolated with Ghanaian tunes – though I guess Amena is Ghanaian and Nigerian too. I’m not sure about you, though, but my experience of covid, admittedly right at the start of things, tells me that it’s the polar opposite of optimism, which makes this farrago all the harder to believe.  “Literally letting his hair down, Burns is playing more confidently and Crawley is naturally aggressive,” says Colum Fordham. “If England treat this as a chase – one-day style, we’re pretty good at this style of cricket – rather than grimly hanging on for survival, I think they’ve got much more of chance.” Agreed. If they’d’ve picked the 50-over team and told them to have at it, they’d’ve posted better totals than they have. “This is all a bit unexpected, tweets Guy Hornsby. “Whatever happens - and it’ll probably be capitulation - I hope we can make a fist of it, if only for Mark Wood. He’s such a great guy and has bowled himself into the ground and finally he has figures he deserves. We’ll always have 40-0.” Agreed on all counts he’s been England’s best player by far, and it’s a shame his mates have let him down. Just a few days ago, Aggers made a sage case for leaving him out in this Test, given a champo-style pitch that called for the nagging accuracy of Overton. Personally, I’d have flown Darren Stevens out. “It was a real treat to wake up and see Wood has a well-deserved five-wicket haul,” emails Tom van der Gucht. “No doubt, there’ll be some comments about how if Archer and Stone had stayed fit we would’ve been more competitive. But, a simple look at the stats on Cricinfo show Robinson, Broad, Anderson and (after this haul fairly reflected the quality of his bowling) Wood show the bowlers have averaged under 30 for their wickets highlighting the disappointing batting displays and mishandling of the spine department. Who knows, if Leach had played more last summer and arrived with better rhythm and confidence, or, if Parkinson had been given a pop at the champ, the Aussie middle and lower order would’ve been restricted too.” Imagine the muddle England’s selectors would’ve got themselves into with a compliment from which to select!

File photograph: Damien MeyerAFP via Getty ImagesThe milder impact of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 on infected people and hospitals has led the Government to relax the rules on isolation and testing to allow more people return to work and to protect essential public services. Here is a guide to what you need to know about the new rules in this regard.What are the changes?The Government has agreed to loosen rules on Covid-19 testing, self-isolation guidance for those who test positive for the virus, and restrictions for people who are close contacts of Covid cases.What is the biggest change?The most significant difference is on fully vaccinated close contacts who have received their vaccine booster and are not displaying any symptoms of Covid-19. They no longer have to restrict their movements for five days. Instead, they are being asked to wear a medical (typically blue) or higher-grade face mask (the typically white FFP2N95 variety) for 10 days when in crowded or enclosed spaces and to take regular antigen tests over seven days, with the last test on day seven. Close contacts who have not been boosted only have to restrict their movements for seven days, instead of the 10 previously recommended.Close contacts of any age who have themselves recovered following Covid-19 detected by a PCR or antigen test since December 1st are not required to restrict movements or test if asymptomatic.What effect will these particular changes have?This new arrangement will likely affect tens of thousands of people who are stuck at home and cannot go to work, ensuring – most importantly – that essential services can continue.What is happening with testing?Previously if people between the ages of four and 39 with symptoms tested positive for Covid-19 on an antigen test, they had to get an official PCR test through the HSE to confirm their infection. From now on, anyone who has a positive antigen test no longer needs to go for a PCR test. They can register their positive antigen test result on and upload their close contacts to the HSE’s system and antigen tests will then be sent out to their close contacts.What is changing in relation to the rules for those who test positive for Covid-19?There has been no change in the rule for people who have received the vaccine boosters: if these people test positive, they still have to self-isolate for seven days. For those who have not received a booster dose who test positive, however, they only have to self-isolate for seven days, instead of the 10 previously. In other words, everyone who tests positive for Covid-19 will only have to isolate for seven days. People should only exit self-isolation after seven days if their symptoms have substantially or fully resolved for the final two of those seven days.Are any additional precautions being recommended?For 10 days including any isolation periods, both confirmed Covid-19 cases and close contacts are advised to limit close contacts with people outside their household, especially in crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces to wear a face mask in crowded spaces to take an antigen test before entering crowded spaces or prior to close contact with others outside their household, and to work from home if possible.Everyone over 12 who tests positive should wear a medical grade or FFP2 face mask for 10 days under this new advice and children aged between nine and 12 who test positive should wear a well-fitted mask for 10 days. Any close contacts over 12 who have not been boosted should wear an FFP2 or medical grade mask for 10 days. The State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has said that booster vaccines for children aged 12 to 15 will be considered shortly.When will these changes come into effect?From midnight on Thursday, so most people will not enjoy the benefit of these changes until they wake up on Friday morning.Will the State be sending out antigen tests and medical and respirator masks for free?The HSE is already sending out antigen tests to close contacts but the Government is not planning on providing them to the general public. There are no plans to distribute free medical-grade masks or the more expensive FFP2 respirator masks. Opposition parties have called on the Government to cover the cost of both antigen tests and medical grade masks for all households.What has led to these rule changes?New EU advice from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) issued last weekend paved the way, with a change in guidance for close contacts. The ECDC said that if any close contacts had a negative PCR or antigen test, they may not need to restrict their movements so long as they self-monitor for symptoms, continue to wear a mask and stay away from vulnerable groups. Dr Holohan told Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly in a letter on Tuesday that the updated guidance from the ECDC, considering the rapid spread of Omicron in Europe, aimed to provide options on quarantine, particularly when countries face “high or extreme pressure” on health systems and other essential services.What is the motivation to make the changes now when daily case numbers are still so high?The vast number of confirmed Omicron infections since Christmas has affected two or three times this number because of people being identified as close contacts of those cases. Given that Dr Holohan estimated that up to 500,000 people were likely to have been infected last week, this would mean well in excess of 1 million additional people may be forced to stay at home, based on the average number of close contacts. The Government had expressed concern that the rules on close contacts were causing major difficulties for businesses and public services. An estimated 15,000 HSE staff are currently out on Covid-related leave, putting hospitals under severe pressure.Is it premature given the high number of cases?Some have suggested that it is, particularly when the seven-day average of new daily cases is still north of 20,000. Dublin City University immunology professor Christine Loscher expressed surprise at the “blanket” easing of close contact requirements amid concerns over how much more transmissible the Omicron variant was and how little was known about what percentage of close contacts become infected.How do the changes compare with what is happening in other countries?In the UK, since Tuesday, most people with a positive antigen test have not been required to take a confirmatory PCR test to confirm they have Covid-19. Last week, Germany reduced self-isolation for positive Covid-19 cases and close contacts from 14 days to 10, with the option to end their isolation period on day seven with a Covid-19 test. The US has gone further, reducing the amount of time that confirmed Covid-19 cases must isolate to five days last month.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"tributes paid to ashling murphy at vigils in ireland london and new york","story":"Floral tributes and candles are left after a vigil outside the London Irish Centre in Camden, London. Photograph: Dominic LipinskiPA WireAt least a dozen more vigils are to take place across the country on Saturday and Sunday, in response to the killing of Ashling Murphy in Tullamore, Co Offaly.In Cork, hundreds of people attended a vigil and walk on Saturday morning at the Atlantic Pond.A rally organised by Socialist Feminist Movement Rosa was held in Dublin’s Smithfield Square on Saturday afternoon.Former MEP Joe Higgins performed a song on the tin whistle in memory of Ms Murphy’s love of traditional music.The former Socialist TD and Rosa activist Ruth Coppinger said Ashling Murphy’s killing had resulted in an “unprecedented wave of grief and anger” that had “gripped the country” over the last number of days.“Ashling’s murder has burst open a dam and that sentiment is now more widely reflected throughout society. We can no longer accept women and gender nonconforming people living in fear ,” she said.Ms Coppinger called for a major conference to be convened to bring together women’s organisations, the trade union movement, student unions and community groups as well as LGBT+, traveller and migrant organisations to bring about “fundamental change on this issue”.Rosa activist Harper Cleves said Ms Murphy “did everything women are told to do to protect themselves . . . and that still wasn’t enough, because nothing will ever be enough in a world that thrives on misogyny and that pushes it down our throats.”Student activist Haritha Olaganathan said there was “an epidemic of femicide” and “a culture of misogyny” that needed to be addressed in Ireland.“It is time to stand up to the fact that femicide is an Irish issue as much as it is an international one,” she said.The crowd of several hundred at the Smithfield rally chanted “not one more” in response to the names of women who had been killed in Ireland in recent years, including Nadine Lott, Jennie Poole, Natalia Karaczyn and Ashling Murphy.A woman named Elizabeth, who said she had “narrowly avoided the same fate as Ashling twelve years ago”, said the past few days have been “terrifying and triggering” for her but that the nationwide reaction to Ms Murphy’s murder had been “so important” in working towards change.Vigils have spread beyond Ireland in recent days, with events organised in Glasgow and Edinburgh, as well as in Brisbane, Australia.\u0026nbsp  At a vigil in north London on Saturday, people held candles and stood in silent tribute outside the London Irish Centre.\u0026nbsp  Traditional music was played in honour of Ms Murphy while some of the crowd quietly sang or hummed along.\u0026nbspAnna Johnston, cultural officer at the London Irish Centre, said people had come together in solidarity with those who knew and loved Ms Murphy “and all the women of Ireland and further afield who are angry, distressed and heartbroken”.\u0026nbspAddressing the crowd, she added: “Today, along with Ashling, we remember all the women who have had their lives stolen through gender-based violence. We shouldn’t be here, and Ashling should be.”On Friday, thousands of people gathered in all corners of the country to remember the 23-year-old primary school teacher who was murdered while out of for a jog on a canal bank in the late afternoon.In Dublin, some five thousand women and men, young and old, gathered outside the Dáil. Many held candles, while others carried bouquets of flowers. Some of Ms Murphy’s friends played traditional Irish music in her honour.In Tullamore, Ms Murphy’s family attended a vigil alongside neighbours and friends. Ms Murphy’s father, Ray, and sister, Amy, performed traditional music to a large crowd.Scores of vigils took place in many other towns and cities on Friday, including Waterford, Limerick and Belfast.Throughout the rest of the weekend, vigils have been organised in Cork city, Sligo, Waterford, Kilkenny\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspLondon.On Friday night in New York\u0026nbspa vigil was organised by the Aisling Irish Community Center at the centre’s location in Yonkers, followed by a short prayer service in a nearby church.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"African country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"time tories rediscover values","story":"This week the twin pillars on which the political constitution of this nation rests, government and monarchy, took a battering. The reputation of the former was assailed by endless revelations of lockdown parties the latter by allegations of sexual misconduct levelled at the Duke of York. It would be a dispiriting state of affairs at any time, but is especially so for a country desperate to put two years of pandemic suffering behind it. Instead of being hauled back by revelations from the past, voters want to look to the future — to the kind of thriving, entrepreneurial, economically confident, low-tax country that the Conservative Party is historically celebrated for building.The Queen, as so often, has shown the way, doing as much as is possible to ensure that the Virginia Giuffre affair can no longer tarnish the institution she leads with such grace. The banishment of her second, and reportedly favourite, son can by no means have been easy. But she, in concert with Princes Charles and William, has acted decisively and in the interest of those who honour the history, continuity and tradition of a monarchy that unites us all. No 10 could follow suit by anticipating, rather than meekly awaiting, the Sue Gray report, which it has used as an ever-less effective shield against legitimate questions about lockdown breaches. The Prime Minister should act with vigour to demonstrate that Downing Street is staffed by an effective team dedicated to driving through an agenda that has for too long been undermined by epidemiological or ideological ersions.On the former, the time has come, after two years, to abandon definitively the prospect of future restrictions and isolations, with their dreadful consequences on mental health and school disruption, hospital waiting lists and staff shortages. Such rules have never made complete sense. Voters are not angry, for example, because Downing Street held parties outside. They are angry because they were denied the opportunity to enjoy themselves in the same common sense way. They vividly remember being ushered off park benches by officials in high-vis jackets, or chased from sports pitches by the police.The utter illogicality of such rules was exposed this week in the Prime Minister’s apology – “I should have sent everyone back inside” – which of course would have been far less safe than keeping his staff in the garden. The public’s stories of contrasting sacrifices are hard enough to hear but the fury of those who made them is intensified because many draconian rules were always bafflingly irrelevant to the fight against Covid. One day, when we return to normality, they must be given an explanation and, in many cases, an apology.Normality must come soon, and for good. Despite the doom-laden warnings, omicron has proved to be a variant less severe than its predecessors. Henceforth Covid-19 — like flu — must be a disease we live with, not hide from. With that attitude clear, businesses will have the confidence to rebuild and grow again. We already know this can happen. In November, before the Plan B freeze in response to Omicron, the economy grew strongly, and was larger than before the pandemic. Since then, inevitably, it has contracted again.Sadly though, just as the worst of the winter is put behind us, the Government seems intent on making another significant mistake, persisting with tax hikes to fund an NHS which needs reform to ensure its money is spent wisely. This year a staggering 40 per cent of day-to-day departmental government expenditure will go on the NHS or social care.It is another example of sensible Conservative instincts being jettisoned. Doing so comes at a very real cost, as the Prime Minister may be about to find out. It is clear he instinctively felt outside Downing Street parties were perfectly sensible. Ironically, he may now be punished not because he was wrong, but because he was right, but still imposed the wrong path on the rest of the country.This weekend Tory MPs will be back in their constituencies, and doubtless be bombarded by outrage. Economically and ideologically they will be forced to reflect on what the Tory party should stand for.Their leader, the man who promised buccaneering freedom, has delivered crimped, polling-led policies and pettifogging restrictions which, with mask mandates and work from home orders, endure to this day. As Lord Frost makes clear in his interview elsewhere on these pages today, if the Conservatives are to come through, whoever is in charge, they must reaffirm and champion the principles of growth and, above all, liberty.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Tory chairman insists \u0026#39change of culture\u0026#39 will be needed following party revelationsNovak Djokovic set to be deported after losing Australia visa case - latest updates\u0026#39They killed a beautiful sportsman and his career\u0026#39: How the world reacted to Novak Djokovic\u0026#39s deportationFull list of Tories calling for Boris Johnson to resign - and those still backing the PMSeven laws which prove this is no deregulating GovernmentScott Morrison, the prime minister who keeps people out of AustraliaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"looking back lockdown got wrong","story":"Among scientists, there is a well-known aphorism: “All models are wrong, but some models are useful.” Coined by the British statistician George Box in 1976, it neatly illustrates the pitfalls of correctly anticipating an outcome based on an imperfect, and ever-changing, set of inputs. And it is the reason modelling alone should never be used to drive policy.Yet despite this widely-accepted flaw, models have played a pivotal role in the Covid pandemic, frequently used to justify the removal of freedoms as fundamental as being allowed to walk in the open air, or hold the hand of a dying loved one – scenarios that modellers never anticipated.“Should models be used to lock people down? No, they shouldn’t,” says Professor Graham Medley, chair of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M). “Our job is to lay out a range of possibilities for the future, but it can’t predict the future.“Government has to make difficult decisions to get the country through the epidemic with the least possible harm, but the harms accrue from the controls as well as the virus.”The speed of the pandemic hasn’t helped matters. Complex models that, ordinarily, would have been developed over months or even years have been required within days. Often, the underlying assumptions have already changed by the time they are released for public scrutiny.“A week is a long time in politics, but it’s an age in a pandemic,” says Medley.Modelling was thrust into the public consciousness in the spring of 2020, when the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) began publishing the evidence it was using to advise the Government.In the early stages of the pandemic, Downing Street’s coronavirus strategy was to “flatten the peak” of cases, and avoid a resurgence in the winter when the NHS would be less able to cope.Yet after Imperial College published its Report 9 in March 2020 – which warned the health service would soon be overwhelmed with severe cases of Covid, and might face more than 500,000 deaths if politicians took no action – the Government made an abrupt volte-face.Spooked by the eye-watering numbers and the horrified reaction of the public, Boris Johnson slammed on the brakes and announced a national lockdown.Modelling the trajectory of an entirely new virus was always going to prove tricky. There was scant information about hospitalisation and death rates, or even how many people had the virus.Calculations by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) suggested that one death could have resulted from anywhere between 37 infections and 138,624. At the time there had been 160 in Britain, leading to confusion that the number of people infected could be anywhere from 6,000 to 23 million.“One of my colleagues compared modelling a pandemic in real time to doing engineering on a collapsing building,” says Dr Nick Davies, a modeller from LSHTM who did not contribute to the study.“At the beginning of the pandemic, we didn’t know what Covid\u0027s properties were, and we were asked to look at worst-case scenarios. Not end of life as we know it, but something towards the more pessimistic but not completely unrealistic end. When things are so uncertain, policymakers want to avoid the worst possible outcome.”It was never possible to test Imperial’s “500,000 deaths” figure, because lockdown came into effect on March 26. Some experts believed restrictions arrived too late to work properly, while others thought behaviour changes were have already limiting spread.Dr Ellen Brooks-Pollock, senior lecturer in veterinary public health and infectious disease modelling at Bristol University, says: “At the start of the pandemic, those huge curves showing everyone getting infected, everybody knew that wouldn’t happen, that people wouldn’t sit back with that going on and carry on behaving normally.“Even if the Government didn’t put in restrictions, people would have started behaving differently. But we ended up with the baseline being ‘Assuming nothing changes’, because it’s difficult to know what the alternative baseline is.”Davies adds: “Mobility data does show that people had already started moving around less before lockdown – which roughly coincides with Boris Johnson going on television saying lots of people were going to lose loved ones.“But I think it’s slightly wishful thinking to think you can let it happen and things will be fine on their own. That’s a pretty massive risk to take.”By June 2020, with Covid cases and deaths plummeting, Britain was trying to crawl back to normality, with a phased reopening of schools and retailers. Yet a gloomy document from SPI-M warned that easing lockdown restrictions could drive the R-rate above 1 and advised delaying schools reopening by a month.Keen to kickstart the economy, the Government pushed ahead anyway – and the country experienced a largely Covid-free summer. However, by October, cases were starting to rise again, and modelled scenarios were increasingly downbeat about the coming months.At a press conference on October 31, Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK’s chief scientific adviser, showed a graph from Public Health England (PHE) and Cambridge University warning that deaths could peak at 4,000 a day by December 20.The data was used to justify a second national lockdown on November 5, but Oxford University quickly pointed out that the numbers were crunched before new tier restrictions had come into effect and were vastly wide of the mark.Under the model, daily deaths should have reached 1,000 by the day of the press conference, but the rolling seven-day average was 265. The projections used an R rate of 1.3 to 1.5m, when it had fallen to between 1.1 and 1.3.Bob Seely, the MP for the Isle of Wight, described the estimates as “hysterical” while Penny Mordaunt, the former paymaster general, warned the data were “in need of improvement”.Within days, Sir Patrick and Sir Chris Whitty, the Government’s chief medical adviser, were forced to admit that the 4,000-a-day figure was unlikely, and the episode was later criticised by the official statistics watchdog.Even at the height of the winter wave, the daily death count had only peaked at 1,359, far lower than the 4,000 projection. In fact, by the beginning of December 2020, many of the major modelling groups were a little more optimistic about the pandemic.While health experts were still struggling to understand the virus dynamics of the original Wuhan strain of Covid, a new problem was emerging: variants.On December 14 2020, Matt Hancock, the then health minister, stood up in the House of Commons to inform MPs that a newly mutated virus was spreading exponentially through the Home Counties.Boris Johnson was forced to limit Christmas celebrations for millions on December 21 and, with no sign of a decline, announced a new lockdown on January 4 2021.Cases peaked in the middle of January, and with the vaccine rollout in full swing, the Government was working on a roadmap out of restrictions by February. However, in the middle of February, scientists at Imperial, Edinburgh and Warwick presented new models that warned early release could result in another, even deadlier wave.Imperial College estimated the Government’s lifting of restrictions at the tail end of winter could cause between 15,000 and 25,000 hospitalisations in the summer and early autumn – higher even than the first peak in April 2020.The MP Mark Harper was among the first to point out a flaw in the reasoning, warning there was a “concerning pattern of assumptions not reflecting the much more positive reality”.A glance at the scientists’ assumptions showed he had a point. The models were based on a pessimistic uptake of an effective vaccine. In the end, hospitalisations never rose beyond 8,500.Addressing why the models often seem overly pessimistic, Medley says: “I’m always going to have the public and media saying it wasn’t as bad as the models suggested, but if I’m doing my job properly, there should always be a worse case scenario than the one that actually happens.“For me, the worst outcome would be for the Government to say: ‘Why didn’t you tell me it could be as bad as this?’“In the early stages of the epidemic, I was criticised very heavily for not locking down to save lives. Then I was criticised very heavily because people thought I was trying to argue for more lockdowns. I was doing neither.”Dr Leon Danon, of the University of Bristol, added: “The idea that modelling is somehow pessimistic or optimistic is wrong. Models are neutral and much more dispassionate. It is what it is – it’s not ‘calling’ for anything.”By March 2021, although the decline in death rates was running three weeks ahead of the central estimates, modelling suggested a full release in June could trigger a third wave with deaths of up to 59,900.Again, the assumptions used were found to be too pessimistic. A paper issued by Imperial College assumed just 44.6 per cent of the population would have immunity by June 21 – the original Freedom Day. When the date rolled around, it turned out to be 60 per cent.Vaccine effectiveness had again been underestimated, and it was clear that hospital occupancy was nowhere near as grave as even the most optimistic scenarios.Scientists at the University of Warwick had suggested the number of people in hospital with Covid by the start of June could hit 1,750, while Imperial said 7,000. In the end, it was around 1,000.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, warned that modelling had been “crude and unreliable”, and urged the Government not to use it when deciding whether or not to press ahead with Freedom Day.Yet despite the encouraging signs and vocal warnings, Johnson delayed the end of lockdown by a month: new modelling published on June 14 suggested a deadly third wave was still on the horizon.In its most pessimistic assessment, Imperial College estimated that Britain could experience a further 203,824 deaths over the next 12 months, while more modest estimates from rival groups suggested more than 50,000 would die.Critically, the models had failed to factor in new data from PHE (now UKHSA) showing that the vaccines offered much greater protection against hospitalisation than first thought.While SPI-M estimated that vaccines would reduce infection by between 24 and 48 per cent after a first dose, and between 30 and 60 per cent after the second dose, PHE said it could be closer to 70 per cent after a first dose, and 85 per cent after a second. Switching to a more optimistic vaccine scenario may have seen the projected number of deaths slashed sevenfold.“A few times, we’ve been really unlucky,” says Davies. “This was obviously really good news, but it made it look like we were just ignoring the data, when we just didn’t know about it when we put together our roadmap scenarios. The UKHSA’s updated vaccine efficacy assumptions turned out to be a lot better than anyone thought they would be.“But we made it clear to policymakers that things had turned out better than expected, and that things would not be as bad as the scenarios suggested.”Johnson pressed ahead with lifting full restrictions in July – but a brief spike in cases during summer 2021 led Professor Neil Ferguson of Imperial to predict that Britain would soon hit one million infections a day.The increases were later shown to have been driven by fans attending the Euro 2020 football tournament, and cases dropped dramatically after both England and Scotland’s football teams were ejected from the competition. Modellers had also failed to appreciate how cautious the public would be after restrictions were lifted.“We often can’t predict what people are going to do,” Medley explains. “In normal times, you get a long way thinking about what the average person will do. But in a pandemic, behaviour is a lot less predictable.However, some experts believe that more attention should have been paid to this ‘real-world’ data. Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine, from the University of East Anglia, says: “The drop after the Euros was predictable – it wasn’t rocket science. If we’d spent more time looking at what was happening in the real world, rather than at the models, it would have been obvious.”Towards the end of last autumn, Britain’s Covid epidemic looked like it was dying out. Then omicron hit.South Africa first reported the variant on November 24. Within a day, Government scientists here were urging ministers to impose new restrictions. By December 13, the Health Secretary Sajid Javid claimed that there were already 200,000 omicron infections a day in Britain, with cases doubling every two days. An SPI-M consensus statement released on December 14 warned that the variant could bring between 3,000 and 10,000 hospital admissions a day, and between 600 and 6,000 deaths, leading to unsustainable pressures on the NHS.However, it quickly became clear that omicron was much milder than delta. By mid-December, the South Africa epidemic levelled off, with statisticians noting that the case fatality rate had plummeted from one in 33 to one in 200.Real-world data on December 14 showed that the risk of hospitalisation with omicron was 23 per cent lower than delta, while a few weeks later, it was shown to cause just a quarter of deaths.It now looks as if cases in Britain peaked around January 5 2022, without overwhelming the NHS. Earlier this week, Professor David Heymann of the LSHTM said the UK could be one of the first countries in the world to emerge from the pandemic.Davies, whose model had suggested that omicron could lead to between 25,000 and 75,000 deaths, says that it quickly became apparent that initial assumptions about omicron were wrong.“In the very early data, it was looking like omicron severity was similar to delta. But over those first few weeks, the picture clarified and the severity came down,” he says.“We were informing policymakers every day about the changing picture. It’s difficult to know what to do. Either we don’t put our projections out at all – then it’s completely opaque what’s feeding into Government decisions – or we put them out with the understanding that misinterpretations cannot be corrected.”Modellers argue it is better to know something about a situation than nothing, even if the whole picture is unclear. Whitty has previously said: “An 80 per cent right paper before a policy decision is made is worth ten 95 per cent right papers afterwards.”But, given the experience of the pandemic, other experts now think models too unreliable to be driving public health policy.Hunter says: “I think we have put too much emphasis on modelling, and that has failed us, to a certain extent. The way omicron is panning out is nowhere near as grim as many were predicting.”Certainly, it is time for the models to come with a health warning, with some calling for a move to interactive graphs that could be updated in real-time.“Maybe we should think about it in terms of a weather forecast, where we say there is a 20 per cent chance of rain,” adds Brooks-Pollock. “We know that sometimes it rains when nobody was expecting it.”What is clear is that the Government is no longer so enthralled by the models, and is willing to treat them with a healthy dose of scepticism as they pay more attention to real-world data – which is arguably what the modellers wanted all along.“The idea that models should have some kind of control is wrong,” says Medley, who has acted as the middle-man between the Government and SPI-M, and has not always found it easy explaining the nuances of complex models to politicians, who are largely humanities graduates.“In the initial stages of the pandemic, my time was spent talking to people inside the Government who are not science-trained, to help them understand the pitfalls, because graphs can be persuasive.“Communications have hugely improved. I think we’ve now got the Government to understand that we cannot make predictions about what is going to happen.”More from NewsNovak Djokovic to leave Australia on Sunday after losing visa case - latest updatesPolitics latest news: Tory chairman insists \u0026#39change of culture\u0026#39 will be needed following party revelations\u0026#39They killed a beautiful sportsman and his career\u0026#39: How the world reacted to Novak Djokovic\u0026#39s deportationFull list of Tories calling for Boris Johnson to resign - and those still backing the PMSeven laws which prove this is no deregulating GovernmentScott Morrison, the prime minister who keeps people out of AustraliaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"student loans could removed low quality university courses","story":"Universities are facing a crackdown on “Mickey Mouse” degrees as the watchdog threatens to withdraw student loan funding from low-quality courses.Vice-chancellors will be warned by the Office for Students (OfS) that they risk being hit with sanctions - including financial penalties - if their degrees fail to deliver for students.The higher education regulator had pledged to take a more “robust” approach to quality assurance, which will include launching investigations where bad practice is reported.Degrees with high drop-out rates and low rates of graduate employment will be targeted by the OfS for scrutiny.The regulator will publish proposals this week which set out the series of “minimum requirements” they expect degree courses to meet in terms of student outcomes.If courses are deemed to consistently fall below these they could be barred from receiving student loan funding which would most likely render them financially unviable.A well-placed source at the OfS said: “Students need to know that wherever they choose to study, their course will be of high quality. It is therefore important to crack down on courses that are below par, and our new plans – to be published this week – will be setting out how we intend to do this.”Whitehall officials are concerned at the cost to the taxpayer of the increasing number of pupils who take up a place at university, but fail to earn enough to pay back their student loan.Ministers have been particularly critical of so-called Mickey Mouse degrees which saddle students with debt but add little to their job prospects, and have previously accused universities of running “threadbare” courses in a rush to get “bums on seats”.It comes as Universities UK (UUK), the vice-chancellor membership group, launches its own framework aimed at tackling low-quality degrees.Prof Julia Buckingham, the former UUK president who chaired the organisation’s advisory group on the issue, acknowledged that universities “have faced regular waves of criticisms for so-called Mickey Mouse degrees”.She told The : “Universities cannot and will not ignore concerns that some courses do not meet these high standards and let down students and taxpayers.“We will not allow a small minority of courses to damage our world-class reputation, let down our students and dent the confidence of prospective students, their parents and the public.”Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) showed that almost eight in 10 graduates will never pay back their full student loan under the current tuition fees system.The think-tank found that arts graduates cost the taxpayer £35,000 each with degrees in “creative arts” subjects - which includes Music, Drama, Fine Art and Design Studies – the most costly to the taxpayer since so few alumni earn enough money to pay back their student loan in full.Of the £9 billion that the government spends on higher education each year, more than £1 billion is on creative arts courses alone, where three-quarters of the total amount dished out in loans is picked up by the taxpayer, the IFS report from 2019 found.The higher education regulator said it will not accept the argument that students from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to get a good job after graduating.It has made it clear that “minimum requirements” it will set for student outcomes will not be dropped down for universities which admit a high proportion of undergraduates from deprived households.Ministers are preparing to publish their long-awaited response to an official review of higher education, known as the Augar review, in the coming months.Led by Sir Philip Augar, the former equities broker, the review was the first one since 1963 that the Government ordered into higher and further education.Prof Buckingham said: “Just like any other sector which is partly reliant on public funding, the need for universities to prove their worth is continuous.“Universities must be able to communicate clearly why they offer the courses they do, and what the value of those courses is to prospective students, employers and the public.”She said that UUK’s own framework is a “necessary step towards a more transparent sector”.Professor Julia Buckingham CBE, chairman of Universities UK’s advisory group for programme reviewsWhat is a degree worth? Since the Conservative Party pledged to deal with ‘low value degrees’ in their 2019 manifesto, universities have faced regular waves of criticisms for so-called “Mickey Mouse” degrees. Despite the clear benefits of a university education – including the £9,500 more per year on average graduates in England earn compared with non-graduates – and the growing need for highly skilled workers in the public and private sectors, student recruitment has been ridiculed as a rush to get “bums on seats”, and students taking degrees without a clear path to a well-paid profession have been painted as ill-informed risk takers.Working with vice-chancellors across the country during my time as President of Universities UK, I chaired an advisory group to address these issues. On Sunday, we will publish a new framework to help universities identify and deal with low value degrees. This new framework builds on the work universities already undertake each year to look at the performance of their courses, and provides a common approach to determining what counts as good quality and good value. Our guidance highlights core measures universities should be considering, and which you might expect, including student satisfaction with teaching, assessment, feedback and academic support, ‘drop-out’ rates and career outcomes for graduates, but they go further than this too.Universities want to support the Government’s levelling-up agenda. We’re now encouraging universities to consider measures such as how courses support local businesses and high-growth industries, if their courses are helping to close attainment gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students, and whether their graduates are working in roles which support essential public services such as the NHS, or roles which support the UK’s lucrative creative industries or have a positive impact on the environment.This framework has already been successfully piloted with a group of institutions, and it has the full backing of the UUK Board. We hope to use it to work together with the Government and the university regulator – the Office for Students – in their reflections on the wider value and contribution of courses.Universities are committed to identifying and tackling any course which isn’t up to scratch, and by this time next year, you should be able to read statements on English university websites detailing the approaches they are taking annually in monitoring, assessing, and taking action on low-value courses.Just like any other sector which is partly reliant on public funding, the need for universities to prove their worth is continuous. Universities must be able to communicate clearly why they offer the courses they do, and what the value of those courses is to prospective students, employers and the public. This framework is a necessary step towards a more transparent sector, and Universities UK will be supporting its members at every turn.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Tory chairman insists \u0026#39change of culture\u0026#39 will be needed following party revelationsNovak Djokovic set to be deported after losing Australia visa case - latest updates\u0026#39They killed a beautiful sportsman and his career\u0026#39: How the world reacted to Novak Djokovic\u0026#39s deportationFull list of Tories calling for Boris Johnson to resign - and those still backing the PMSeven laws which prove this is no deregulating GovernmentScott Morrison, the prime minister who keeps people out of AustraliaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"djokovic proves australias zero covid policy always unsustainable","story":"The strange case of Novak Djokovic has shone a bright light on the eccentric behaviour of the world’s top tennis player. But it also has awoken the world to Australia’s own eccentric response to the Covid epidemic.Indeed, the cancellation of Djokovic’s visa on Friday sums up the uncompromising attitude of the Australian government over the past 22 months.For almost two years, the nation has ploughed its own lonely furrow in response to the pandemic. The state government in Victoria achieved a world record in locking down Melbourne six times in 20 months for a total of 262 day, just overtaking Buenos Aires as the most locked-down city in the world.Zero Covid was a deliberate policy of the state government and has thrown the country into a vicious political cycle: people got scared and demanded more restrictions then the restrictions proved so popular that the state governments doubled down.But is this draconian policy starting to rebound now?From the very beginning of the pandemic, Australia had the idea that somehow the country could be completely sealed off from the rest of the world and kept virus-free. Its first response was to batten down the hatches. It looked at the rest of the world – the trolleys of dying people outside Italian hospitals – and said: “that won’t be happening here”. So it closed the borders on March 20 2020.The thinking was that you didn’t need to be an epidemiologist to know this was a transmissible disease, so the best thing to do was avoid it. It appointed the chief medical officers as Governors of State. No-one had ever heard of Nicola Spurrier, the chief public health officer of South Australia, before. Within weeks, people were copying her clothes and hairdo.But the truth is that the state governments scared the public witless. There was Australia, the free-spirited land of the rugged inidualist ready to take on all the world throws at it, reduced to quivering in fear behind closed borders. The State Premiers talked up the risks of Covid to such an extent that the public came to believe that it was as dangerous as the Black Death.A year or so ago, an opinion poll showed that Australians on average thought they had a 33 per cent chance of dying from Covid if they contracted it. No effort was made to put this into perspective and explain that the majority who lost their lives typically had comorbidities or were the frail elderly.So frightened were the public that they demanded increasingly severe measures. The state governments started off by introducing mandatory mask wearing and social distancing. But then they decided to go further closing borders between the states and whenever one or two cases of Covid appeared, the whole state was then locked down.Despite this, from the outside it seemed to many that life here was continuing as normal. But the reality was very different.Schools were shut for the best part of a year: it varied from state to state, but my grandchildren were away from their classrooms for over 200 days. All shops, except those which sold essential goods, were shuttered. Pubs, restaurants and other community outlets were closed. Curfews were introduced and police patrolled the streets to make sure a cowered public were sticking to the rules.Then there were the quarantine hotels. This time last year, even Australian citizens who wished to return to their own country had to spend 14 days in quarantine after their arrival. For the privilege, they had to pay $3,000 (£1,590). In fact, when Djokovic came to Australia to play in the 2021 Open – which he eventually won – he had to endure the same two-week wait.I can speak from my own experience. After travelling from London to Perth in December, I was obliged to book into the Pan-Pacific hotel in Perth. My crime? To return for Christmas to my own country.There was no escape. You couldn’t stretch your legs in the corridor, let alone go outside. My hotel didn’t have windows that opened, so I lived in air-conditioned isolation accompanied only by my laptop, books and a television set for a fortnight. I had plenty of time on my hands so looked up the Western Australian regulations for prisoners in solitary confinement. They must be given, by law, one hour of exercise outside their cell every day.What made the problem worse was that the state governments chose to make very few rooms available, having judged that the more quarantine hotels there were in existence, the higher the risk of Covid entering Australia. As a result, there wasn’t capacity to accommodate the demand from Australians wishing to return home.Despite all of this, omicron is now surging Down Under, with a record number of cases being recorded – 109,000 were confirmed on Thursday, although there have only been 2,572 Covid deaths since the start of the pandemic. Some states have now introduced fines for those who fail to report positive antigen testsNo one seemed to care what the cost of all this would be. All they wanted was to be protected from Covid regardless of the social, economic and broader community consequences.There has been no cost benefit analysis, no modelling, nor seemingly any thought given to the impact of these endless lockdowns, aside from some compensation to small and medium-sized businesses. What about the impact on children, particularly from low income backgrounds, after being locked out of school for months on end? Or the mental health impact of denying people the opportunity to mix with others and to see the people they love?When John Howard was evicted from office, 14 years ago, the federal government delivered a budget surplus and had no net debt. Today it not only runs a huge budget deficit but has accumulated debt which will soon reach $1 trillion (£529bn). Australians will be paying off the Covid compensation debt for generations to come.When the vaccines arrived, the federal government invested heavily in AstraZeneca. It was even manufactured in Melbourne. But once more a vicious scare campaign erupted, one which made even president Macron’s comments about the vaccine seem restrained.People argued that there was almost no Covid in Australia. So why have a vaccine that could hold even a tiny risk of a blood clot?Thus, the rollout was slowed down and the jab not recommended for under 50s. In January Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was pursuing a deliberately cautious approach, because the country was not in an “emergency situation” and “we don’t have to cut corners. We don’t have to take unnecessary risks.”Then because no-one was vaccinated, there was a greater argument for lockdowns.There are two points to be made about these illiberal and oppressive policies. First, they were driven more by politics and fear than science.Secondly, they were never going to work. Unless Australia cut itself off from the rest of the world indefinitely, Covid was always going to sneak in and spread. The Zero Covid policies of Australia’s state governments were an unsustainable con. Now that the omicron strain is rampant, it is being handled much more rationally: booster vaccinations are being rolled out at speed, the vulnerable are finally being protected and the public is socially distancing.But the nonsense of closing borders and locking the public up in pursuit of the chimera of a Zero Covid society has been abandoned. Well, almost abandoned. Still the Western Australian government clings to this dotty idea but once Covid spreads there - as it will - then it too will open to the world.Australia’s Covid policy has come a long way over the past 22 months. These days, it has even reopened to the vaccinated traveller. So it’s understandable that some people sympathised with Djokovic in his vain struggle against Australia’s Covid restrictions, with his supporters – some with placards – protesting outside the hotel in which he was being held.Not that I was ever on his side. He wants to be exempt from the law. And ever since the Magna Carta, exempting the rich, the powerful and the famous from the law has been deemed a very bad idea indeed.Alexander Downer is a former Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs and High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.

About , teenagers will be eligible for their top-up dose when the national booking service opens at the start of the week in the latest phase of the vaccine programme.Previously, boosters were only recommended for clinically vulnerable  and -year-olds who are most at risk from Covid-. But recent data from the UK Health Security Agencyshowed that two doses of the vaccine are not enough to stop people becoming unwell from Omicron, but a booster signicantly increases protection against the iant. Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and deputy lead for the NHS vaccination programme, said: The NHS Covid- vaccination programme is expanding once again to offer eligible young people aged  and  the chance to book their boosters through the online booking service from tomorrow, with walk-in sites also available across the country, as the biggest and fastest vaccine drive in health service history continues at pace. Covid has caused so much disruption for so many families over the past two years, affecting young peopleaposs lives and education, and getting vaccinated protects them, their family and their friends, letting them stay at school and continue socialising.We know that the best protection against coronavirus is to get vaccinated and Iaposd urge everyone, whatever your age, to come forward and get that vital top-up as soon as it is possible.More than , in the age group in England have had their second jab, and will be able to get boosted in the coming weeks as they reach three months after the second dose. Since the vaccination programme rolled out to this age group in August, more than , teenagers in England - seven in  people aged  and  - have had their first dose. The NHS said invitations will be sent out this week encouraging people in the age group to book their appointment through the online booking service, or by finding their nearest walk-in site. Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: More than four in five adults in England have already been boosted, helping to protect them from severe illness and reduce the pressure on the NHS in the face of Omicron.Weaposre now extending the programme to  and -year-olds so they can top-up their immunity this winter to keep themselves and their friends safe. We can learn to live with Covid-everybody comes forward for their vaccines and gets boosted now. However the NHS said that, in line with Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationguidance, it cannot vaccinate  and -year-olds within  weeks, or  days, of a positive Covid- test. Those aged  and  and considered at high risk from Covid- must wait four weeks, or  days, from the date of a positive Covid- test before getting any dose of the vaccine.

The Mirror led the way in revealing the first parties but many others have since been uncovered by a string of media outlets.We also revealed No staff had “wine time Fridays” scheduled every week and would dash to the local Tesco Express with a wheelie suitcase to stock up their £ wine fridge.Covid bereaved families have blasted the bashes, and No’s repeated attempts to obscure the truth before the PM finally apologised. Top civil servant Sue Gray is probing a range of the parties, spanning May  to April , and is expected to publish a report within days. At the time of all these gatherings, indoor socialising was banned to control the spread of the virus.But ultimately the Prime Minister will get to decide himselfhe has breached the Ministerial Code.

Mr Cummings has claimed there was a party in the flat on November  and “other flat parties” that should be investigated.A spokeswoman for Mrs Johnson dismissed the claims as total nonsense”, adding: Mrs Johnson has followedcoronavirusrules at all times and it is categorically untrue to suggest otherwise.”England was in a national lockdown and that day the UK recorded  Covid deaths - the second-highest daily total since May.

Mike Barton, who was Chief Constable of Durham Constabulary until , said it was the politan Police’s duty to gather evidence. The force are resisting getting involved in the scandal and will only study claimsa report by senior civil servant Sue Gray finds crimes may have been committed. A spokesman has said: The Met has ongoing contact with the Cabinet Office in relation to this inquiry. If the inquiry identies evidence of behaviour that is potentially a criminal offence it will be passed to the Met for further consideration. Mr Barton tells today’s BBC Week in Westminster: “Silence by the politan Police is, in my humble opinion, not helpful because this causes greater indignation amongst the public.“Fundamentally, the way that we police in the UK is by consent. “Confidence in the police is not a ‘nice to have’, it is utterly fundamental.” He urged officers to begin examining weeks of revelations of Downing Street parties - particularly because they are so high profile. “If there is a cause celebre causing widespread public outrage then the police should act because the primary objective of encouraging people to follow the rules without police intervention would be lost,” he says. “An investigation doesn’t mean that somebody is going to be prosecuted, it just means, ‘Let’s find out what happened’. “I often get a bit perplexed when I hear police officers say, ‘There is no evidence so we’re not going to investigate’ because I was always told that it was the police’s job to find the evidence. “Obviously there needs to be something there to start an investigation, but I think there’s enough here.”|  He goes on: “The threshold for starting an investigation should be pretty low. The police should have a heightened sense of curiosity.” Reports yesterday suggested Mrs Gray’s report is expected to rule there was no evidence of criminality over the Downing Street parties.However, said is likely to recommend disciplinary action against officials and special advisers involved, and could censure Boris Johnson for his lack of judgement in attending the nitrous May ,  “bring your own booze” bash in his garden, according to the Times.

The Prime Minister told MPs that he “went outside for  mins to thank staff but admitted with hindsight I should have sent them back indoors.The Mirror has since exclusively revealed that Downing Street staff held aposwine-time Fridaysapos throughout the pandemic with Mr Johnson regularly witnessing the gatherings. Sources said that the Prime Minister encouraged aides to “let off steam” despite indoor socialising being banned under lockdown rules.Here we look at everything we now so far about the latest scandal that threatens to finally bring Johnson down. What were Wine Time Fridays Downing Street staff held aposwine-time Fridaysapos throughout the pandemic with Boris Johnson regularly witnessing the gatherings. Sources told the Mirror that the Prime Minister encouraged aides to “let off steam” despite indoor socialising being banned under lockdown rules.The regular event was so popular that staff even invested in a £ drinks fridge to keep their bottles of white wine, Prosecco and beer cool. Sources said the gatherings on occasion went on as late as midnight with up to two dozen aides drinking wine and beer and playing games like Pictionary. They were particularly popular from autumn  to the Spring of  when staff were “fatigued” with the tough Covid restrictions, sources said. However, their popularity waned as the country began opening up and staff no longer had to rely on them for social interaction. When did they take place during the pandemic  Sources claimed that aides took turns on Fridays to visit the local Tescoin Westminster with a wheeled suitcase to fill up the -bottle capacity fridge. An extraordinary picture has emerged of the chiller being delivered through the back door of Downing Street on December , . At the time rules banned two or more people from dferent households from meeting indoors, unless “reasonably necessary” for work purposes. ‘Wine-time Fridays’ were scheduled into the electronic calendars of around  No  staff between pm and pm every week.  Leaving parties Two leaving bashes - one for Mr Johnson’s top spin doctor James Slack and another for the PM’s photographer - took place at Downing Street on April . It was just hours before the Queen sat grieving alone at St George’s Chapel, Windsor. Downing Street’s humiliating apology to Buckingham Palace comes after two leaving dos the night before Prince Philip’s funeral last Spring.  Staff downed alcohol and revellers danced to music blaring from a laptop, with someone sent to a local shop to cram a suitcase with wine. The partying, which started indoors, became so raucous in the garden that one guest had a go on - and broke - the PM’s son Wilf’s swing, according to the . The Government’s guidance at the time warned: “You must not socialise indoors except with your household or support bubble. “You can meet outdoors, including in gardens, in groups of six people or two households.”It has also previously been reported that the PM gave a “shambolic” speech for departing communications director Lee Cain, with the pair posing with “Get Brexit Done” boxing gloves.At the time, England was at the height of its second national lockdown with no indoor mixing between households allowed for social reasons.  Who was involved  It was organised by the No  press office but periodically advisers from other parts of the building would join in. Sources said one regular attendee when tough mixing rules were in place was Captain Steve Higham, then the PM’s defence adviser. The Royal Navy officer now commands the new aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales which is the UK’s largest warship.The Ministry of Defence declined to comment.The PM was said to have attended a “handful” of the gatherings at points when indoor socialising was banned under lockdown rules.These include an event on November , , the day Dominic Cummings walked out of No , when he stayed for a glass of wine and chatted to the team.No  insiders claimed the PM often witnessed ‘wine-time Fridays’ on his way to the Downing Street flat. One source said: “Boris used to stop by for a chat while they had a drink. It was on the way up to his flat and the door was usually open. He knew about it and encouraged it.“ Another added: “He could see everyone sitting there drinking as he walked up. “He would come in and say ‘Hello everyone had a hard week  Letting off some steam  Oh great’. “The idea that he didn’t know there were drinks is total nonsense. If the PM tells you to ‘let off steam’, he’s basically saying this is fine.” What is the Government saying Downing Street apologised to Buckingham Palace after it was revealed more parties were held in No the day before Prince Philip ’s funeral last Spring.But that was before the Wine Time Fridays story broke and Mr Johnson is currently clinging to the forthcoming outcome of the investigation being carried out by Sue Gray into partygate, to get him out of his current mess. A No  spokesperson previously said: “There is an ongoing investigation to establish the facts around the nature of gatherings, including attendance, setting and the purpose with reference to adherence to the guidance at the time. The findings will be made public in due course.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonCoronavirus lockdown\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Join the lockdown community for surveys on your viewsInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ms Truss, who campaigned for Remain in the  referendum, admitted “real mistakes” were made when parties were held during lockdown at Downing Street. “We are very clear that there were real mistakes made,” she said after talks with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefocvic at Chevening, Kent. “But I do think that we need to look at the overall position we’re in as a country, the fact that he has delivered Brexit, that we are recovering from Covid...He has apologised.  “I think we now need to move on and talk about how we are going to sort out issues.” Critics blasted the Cabinet Minister’s desperate attempt to ert attention by trying to reignite the Brexit battles.Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: “ Liz Truss ‘ comments show just how out of touch this Tory Government truly is.“If she wants things to move on, she should submit her letter of no confidence and call on Boris Johnson to resign.” Ms Truss is one of the frontrunners to succeed the PM in a Conservative leadership contest.Potential rivals include Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Health Secretary Sajid Javid and former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Tory GovernmentLiberal DemocratsEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionJeremy HuntLiz TrussBoris JohnsonReferendumPoliticsDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

You can understand this, as the investigation might discover he wasn’t there because Boris Johnson isn’t Boris Johnson. It might turn out he’s Shirley Bassey or Peppa Pig or King Louis the Sixteenth of France. Once it was clear he’d been at the party, he muttered something like: “When I said I was certain that no rules were broken, I was referring to the rules of table tennis, and none of them were breached at all. “When I said I was informed that no party had taken place, I was telling the truth because I informed myself there had been no party, and I took my word for it. I couldn’t have known at the time that I was lying. “I had no idea there was a party in the garden and hadn’t seen the email inviting me to the party. That’s why I went into the garden and stayed for  minutes, because I had no idea there was any reason to be there.” Next he’ll explain: “I often wander into gardens, on the off-chance there might be someone there who wants me to stay for  minutes. On Tuesday I popped up behind a shrub at a garden in Scarborough, and stayed for  minutes, and on Sunday I appeared in a rockery in Sunderland.”And he never questioned why his we was there, at a government workplace meeting, when she doesn’t work for the government. I suppose he assumed she’d become Foreign Secretary and forgotten to tell him. Maybe he’s used this explanation in the past, when he’s been caught having affairs. He’s said: “I had no idea we were having sex, I was under the impression it was a workplace meeting. “The grunts you heard were simply my approval for the accounts to the year ending th April.” This has been his problem all along, he keeps misunderstanding what type of event he’s at. The reason he kept dozing off during Brexit negotiations is he thought he was at a snooker tournament. When he shook hands with patients infected with Covid, he thought he was the Queen after the Royal Variety Performance. This week he’ll go to the toilet in the House of Commons, then insist he’s never done a number two in his le, then an SNP MP will say: “Prime Minister, will you please open a window, your dump stinks”.Then he’ll say: “It would be unfair to discuss the smell until Sue Gray has completed her investigation”. Then he’ll say he is sorry for the impression that he did a dump, but he didn’t realise at the time it was a dump as he thought it was a banana. So here we are, at the point where only five per cent of the population think the Prime Minister is telling the truth. And that’s even more astonishing, as six per cent are his children.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonHouse of CommonsRoyal FamilyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Travellers will have to be fully vaccinated, which is currently two jabs for adults although boosters are still recommended.An announcement has been pencilled in for January , according to The Sunday Times, which will also be when Boris Johnson will lt plan B restrictions such as working-from-home guidance. At present vaccinated travellers must take a lateral flow test two days after theyto Britain. Anyone who tests positive must isolate for ten days, although this can be cut short with a negative lateral flow test on days six and seven. source close to Shapps is said to have told The Sunday Times: We are looking at removing all Covid tests fo rvaccinated travellers by the end of January, which is likely to coincide with the review of the plan B measures onJanuary .” The change will be welcome news for the tourism industry: January is typically the busiest period for summer holiday bookings.

The study encompasses the largest reporting community on Covid globally and allows the gathering of precise information about the iants.Latest information has revealed the top five symptoms logged on the app remain: a runny nose, headache, fatigue, sneezing, and a sore throat.This is a far cry from the symptoms of the alpha iant, the strain of the virus that first swept the country and had the nation fearing coughs.  Other symptoms in the top  most commonly reported included a hoarse voice, chills or shiver, brain fog, feeling dizzy, skipped meals and feeling down. This doesn’t mean there aren’t other symptoms, but these were the most widely reported on the study. On top of that, the symptoms seem to have come on faster than Delta, with a shorter incubation period too.People with the Omicron iant are likely to get them within two-to-five days after exposure.  Professor Tim Spector, who’s worked on the study, said: Over  per cent of people with a cold-like symptom have PCR proven Covid. It will be interesting to seethis changes when schools go back. It shows that the restrictions, social distancing, possibly mask wearing has had a greater effect on colds and flu than Omicron, which is even better at infecting us.  It does suggest that these symptoms are of shorter duration than they are of Delta. People are having symptoms for a shorter amount of time, especially in that first week. If people are testing negative with lateral flow tests at the end of those five days because the whole period of that infection and getting over it appears to be faster.  Top  Omicron symptoms: Headache Runny nose Fatigue Sneezing Sore throat Persistent cough Hoarse voice Other Chills or shivers Fever Dizzy Brain fog Altered smell Eye soreness Unusual muscle pains Skipped meals Loss of smell Chest pain Swollen glands Feeling down  This comes as early data seems to point towards a peak in the Omicron wave, as cases continue to fall day-on-day. The lag between catching Covid, and going to hospital, and then again to ICU means that hospitalisations continue to rise, but there is hope the country may have made it through the worst of it. A number of hospital trusts have felt the full force of the latest iant with dozens declaring critical incidents. As the country has grappled with Covid, revelations continue to spill out about an increasing number of Downing Street parties held throughout the pandemic.

The -year-old music teacher was killed as she went jogging along a canal, but detectives say she could help bring down her attacker. The Gardai in Ireland confirmed they have the killer’s DNA after she fought for her le him the brutal attack in Tullamore on Wednesday afternoon. And that DNA evidence will be crucial in linking her attacker to the shocking murder. “Her attempts to defend herself resulted in us having the attacker’s DNA. She fought him. That will be crucial,” a source said. And as gardai focus on a new suspect who was being treated in a hospital in the east of the country yesterday, sources also confirmed that detectives have secured DNA and fingerprint evidence from the bicycle that they believe is connected to the killing. The Falcon bike was recovered by gardai in Tullamore shortly after Ashline was strangled and has now been forensically examined. Gardai say they have made signicant progress and sources believe they are close to making a breakthrough in the coming days.  Although there has been no fresh arrest in the massive murder investigation, sources have confirmed a suspect has been identied. More than  hours after the killing a man handed himself in to a hospital in the east of the country some distance from where Durrow National School first class teacher Ashling was murdered.

And that means the price of a cappuccino – the UK’s most popular order – will rocket from £. to around £.. The increase will stir up yet more trouble for cafes hit by home working.

Both needed urgent veterinary care and Bella needed her long nails trimming as she struggled to walk. At Grimsby Magistrates’ Court, Martin was convicted following a trial in his absence of causing unnecessary suffering to an English Bull terrier type dog called Bella by failing to provide the necessary veterinary care and attention for her skin condition and for failing to provide the necessary care and attention for her ingrowing nails.  He also caused unnecessary suffering to an American Bulldog cross called Spike for failing to provide veterinary care and attention for his ear infection. He had denied four offences, including three of causing unnecessary suffering to his pet dogs by not getting them the medical treatment. they needed. He faced a further charge of not providing a suitable environment. Martin was banned for le from keeping any pets.  He was sentenced to  hours unpaid work as part of a  month community order and disqualied from keeping all domestic pets for le. He was also ordered to pay £ court costs and a £ victim surcharge. Inspectors found a cage in the flat in Eleanor Street, with old, dirty rags for bedding. Both the dogs were removed from the home due to concerns for their welfare. Prosecuting, Rachel Taylor said how Bella had a skin condition and her skin was red and sore looking with patches of fur loss on her legs, body and face. She was also slightly underweight. Her nails had been cut by a vet following her removal as they were curling round and had been protruding back into her pads making it very dficult for her to walk. Spike was very active and friendly but slightly overweight.  He had been prescribed medication for an infection in his ears upon examination by a vet, following his removal.The prosecutor said the dogs were being kept in an East Marsh flat that was untidy, dirty and a vet report stated it was completely unsuitable for these animals to be housed in.They were discovered in the appalling conditions on September , . The dogs were signed over into the care of the RSPCA and have since been rehomed to new families. In mitigation the defendant said he did not have time to look after the dogs due to work and had been let down by friends.

There have been several cases of burglars blowtorching and then snapping locks to illegally access properties in recent months.Burglars will try and snap the locks off the home before gaining entry but there is one way to stop this from happening, Manchester Evening News reports.Snap-resistant locks are providing more resistance, according to Manchester-based company Locksmith L  E Ltd. Company director Elizabeth John said: We do find that Christmas time is absolutely re for burglaries and people trying to gain access to homes and vans. The reason intruders use blowtorches is that they are trying to remove the handle from around it, so they can get a good grip on the lock to then snap it. On standard locks, once the lock snaps, the door will open. So it’s all about gaining access to try and get a good grip on that lock.  Snap-resistant locks would not allow intruders to open your doors, Elizabeth recommended. She explained: Once it’s snapped, a snap-resistant lock will still snap the lock, but your door will remain locked. It means unfortunately, the lock and the door will still be damaged, but the intruders won’t have gained access to your home. “I think people don’t understand until it happens to them. And it’s quite frustrating for us, because we say, ‘look, everybody needs to have these locks installed’. As you can see from this case with our customer, it does happen, and it does happen a lot, unfortunately. Elizabeth added that burglars use these methods in order to try and be as quiet as possible. She explained: “Usually, people say, ‘ intruders wanted to get in, they would smash a window.’ But, actually, they wouldn’t smash windows, because it makes a lot of sound and it’s alerting people. Normally, people who have been burgled come downstairs in the morning and see that it’s already happened, because the thieves are trying to make as minimal sound as possible by using these methods.  What should you do  Elizabeth urged homeowners to ensure their locks are the right size for their doors. She added: A lot of the time, people have tried to install locks themselves. So, you’ll see a lock that’s too big for the door, which means it’s sticking out. Which means it gives intruders easy access to snap it out without even taking the handle off. It’s like Christmas Day for a thiefthey see a lock thataposs too big- they will target locks like that. Benefits of a snap-resistant lock Having a snap-resistant lock is what stopped intruders from entering the home of the locksmithaposs customer. The customer and her family woke up one morning in December to find their door lock burned and badly damaged. The customer, who asked not to be named, said: It was a few days before Christmas, at around am, my family and I were asleep at home.  We heard a noise, so we came downstairs and switched the lights on, but we didnapost see anybody in the house, so we then went back to bed. “It wasn’t until the next morning when my husband put the keys in the door and half the barrel came out with it. So we thought, ‘oh, that’s not normal.’ Thataposs when we realised what had happened. She added: Had we not had the snap-resistant lock fitted, the thieves would have come into the house, %. Nine tips to prevent your home being burgledHave snap-resistant locks fitted on all doors Hire a professional to install locks, rather than installing them yourself Keep your house keys and car keys out of plain sight- never leave keys inside locks Never leave keys hung up near doors, as thieves can use a wire to access keys through the letterbox If you lose your keys, get the locks changed as soon as possible Install visible deterrents such as floodlights and CCTV Make sure Ring Video Doorbells are positioned correctly Make sure security systems are up-to-date Watch out for markers that thieves use to target homes, like paving slabs, triangle or circle symbols or kidney beans on doorstepsRead MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ChristmasCCTVCCTV footageBurglary\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Join the Secret Elves for celebration inspiration - and brilliant gt ideas and reviewsSpread the cheer!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

His brother, Shaul, , dad, Basil, , and mum Charmagne, , began feeling ill after having food together the weekend of July , . But within two weeks of their symptoms starting, the three members of his family had all passed away.They were all buried next to each other at a Covid cemetery in Portugal on August , Wales Online reports.His family did not get their coronavirus vaccines because they had been frightened by anti-vaccination misinformation.  Francis, , said le hadnapost been easy since losing his family and felt the news of Boris Johnsonaposs party was disrespectful to everyone. He also spoke about the overwhelming abuse he endured from anti-vaxxer activists which only added to his ordeal. Speaking about how heaposs coped with his grief, Francis said: Itaposs not just one birthday you miss, itaposs all the birthdays, the Fatheraposs Days, the Motheraposs Days, all those celebrations and the phone calls.Now thataposs all gone and thereaposs no way you can substitute it. I do have my we who has been really supportive and close friends who have been amazing as well, but it hasnapost been easy. You donapost always feel the shock, part of you feels like youaposre just numb and you donapost feel anything and then you get overwhelmed with emotions. Everything from anger to hopelessness. You grow further away from that and you learn that you are the one who is still alive and you need to move on. You try to do your best to honour their memory, but it definitely has not been easy.With such a painful experience of the pandemic, Francis said he was taken aback when he heard rumours of a Downing Street party happening in May , before Boris Johnson apologised and confirmed he was there..  If youaposre going to create a rule, stick by it, he said. It shouldnapost be a situation of aposdo what I say, not as I doapos. Itaposs not just a kick in the teeth, itaposs so unprofessional and disrespectful to everyone. Is he going to resign  Is he going to stay on  Who knowaposs whataposs going to happen, but heaposs completely undermined the entire process of trying to protect people. People are now turning around and asking aposhave you been spreading a lie apos, aposIs this all just some sort of charade apos, aposwhataposs going on apos. The rules were necessary, but there are a lot of very angry people out there. Everyone wants to see their family members and because of these restrictions, [many] lost the opportunity to see family members.Rather than actually being there and seeing what your family had been going through, you were only able to see them via a phone call or video call.  Knowing all too well how it feels to miss a loved one, Francis said over the last six months, he had been trying his best to share factual information on social media about Covid and vaccinations to help others make informed decisions about getting their jabs. He hopes it will prevent others from enduring his experience of the virus. He said not only is the natural grieving process painful, but on top of that having to deal with the legalities and logistics of losing someone is equally hard. Amongst dealing with all the emotions, youaposve got all legal requirements to deal with, Francis said.  I have probably driven attorneys and estate agents nuts because I havenapost been in the right frame of mind and I would forget things, but theyaposve been very patient. The whole thing has cost about £, and is expected to reach £, -and thataposs not including things like real estate commissions or deposits.Thataposs just three people passing away, getting attorneys to get all the documents and to organise their funerals. The legal fees involved just add up. Then thereaposs the waiting for medical documents and receiving official causes of death, which I have done for my father and brother. I havenapost mustered up the courage to ask for my motheraposs because she was quite ill and the more ill someone is, the more complications you get with Covid.  The doctors told me what she suffered at the time and itaposs not pleasant so I canapost look at that yet.He said as expected, his brother and father officially died of pneumonia as a result of Covid. His father, who had known underlying health conditions also was confirmed to have had sepsi and unforeseen heart complications after contracting the virus, Francis said.Despite having organised most of the logistics involved with the passing of loved ones, Francis said it pained him that he could not move any of them from the mass grave into somewhere more personal at least for the foreseeable future. He said: As far as Iaposm aware thataposs where theyaposll be staying, itaposs a very dficult thought. Everyone has this romantic idea of when you pass away, youaposll be surrounded by your family, but burying someone when you have a digger right next to their graves digging up more graves is really hard. Something Francis said exacerbated his feelings over the last six months is the serious online abuse he was subjected to after he first spoke publicly about his family members dying.  There were threats from as far away as Italy, then I had private messages with all sorts of insults from people as far as Australia, he said. Literally people from all over the world.There was a lot of negativity and in the initial phases it was overwhelming. You get accused of being fake. People were looking for evidence that my family didnapost exist. Some people would send me one message and nothing , others would send me an array of messages or attack my social media feeds. Some of them got so bad I had to get the police involved. It just sort of died off. It wasnapost people who say they donapost want the vaccine because itaposs their choice, it was people who are hardcore against the vaccine and set on spreading misinformation.However, a lot of people expressed their condolences. A lot of people followed my Facebook page I set up to post information and then started making informed decisions.  I wanted to give people the information they need to make that decision as opposed to listening to these blatant lies. The problem is these people are so confident and so loud and people listen to them because they expect people with that confidence to be telling the truth. Francis said his experience had left him unable to look far into the future and follow his long-term ambitions. Instead, Francis said he now just focuses on getting by at present as best he can. When you arenapost born with a large amount of money, you sometimes focus on giving your family things that you havenapost had - and my brother and I both had those goals.Iaposm now in a place where that goal is gone and I have to rebuild myself up.Who I was previously was a development of  years and most of that is based on your experience and the people you care about. I canapost think about what I want in the long-term right now. However, Francis said picking his hobbies back up which included cooking and watching movies had helped to get him back on his feet by giving him a focus. If I could give anyone advicetheyaposre suffering with grief it would be to be kind to yourself and donapost forget about yourself. You are still alive, donapost fall into the trap of hopelessness, he said.

The wicked couple were sent down for a combined  years in prison at Preston Crown Court, where jurors heard how little Ava had the le shaken out of her.A chilling photo taken moments after Avaaposs birth shows Nash - who has autism, cerebral palsy and epilepsy - cradling the infant loosely as she stares intently into the camera. Just eight days later on August , , police were called to an address in Nelson, Lancashire to reports of an unresponsive child. Paramedics rushed the tiny baby to Royal Blackburn Hospital but she couldnapost be saved and died shortly after midnight on August .A post-mortem revealed sheaposd sustained a catastrophic head injury which was the ultimate cause of her death and likely caused by forceful shaking.But that injury was not the only abuse Ava suffered in her short le. She had a separate brain injury and a broken femur - which were thought to have been inflicted in the days prior to her death. The cruel parents were volatile and abusive and consumed with their own destructive relationship - which they put before the safety of their just-born child.Around her crib in their chaotic and squalid home, Nolan smashed glass  and Nash would snatch up Ava by her babygrow - causing her head to flop around unsupported, The Sun reports.Speaking after the sentencing, Det Ch Insp Jill Johnston from Lancashire Police, said: I am pleased that Nolan and Nash have both been jailed, particularly as both have continued to blame each other and neither has ever accepted any responsibility for the acts of violence that led to baby Avaaposs death.  Ultimately their selfish preoccupation with themselves, combined with their toxic and volatile relationship, has resulted in their baby losing her le. I would again like to thank all of the officers and staff who worked on this incredibly complex and emotive case, always with the aim of getting justice for baby Ava, as well as the witnesses who gave evidence and supported this investigation. We will continue to work hard with our partners to protect children like baby Ava from harm, to educate and support parents, but ultimately to protect and safeguard children, to be their voice and to prevent tragic cases such as this.  Preston court heard how the pair repeatedly ignored professional support from midwives and health visitors and blamed each other for Avaaposs death. Earlier this week, the prosecution told Preston Crown Court Ava didnapost stand a chance in the care of her volatile and abusive parents. Mr McLaughlin QC said the prosecution could not say which of Avaaposs parents caused her injuries, but said there is an inbuilt parental responsibility to protect a child and they did not do that. Worse still, on their watch Ava Grace Nolan sustained several non accidental, traumatic injuries. One of them caused those injuries. The prosecution says the other knew. The final injury, her le was literally shaken out of her. She really did not stand a chance.

Cherie, from Hull, had just sat through an inquest into Paigeaposs death when she attempted to take her own le, Hull Live reports.Garry Bolton locked himself and Paige inside the home as it burned, assistant coroner Ian Sprakes ruled.. They both died in the fire in the early hours of January , .  Cherie, who has struggled with alcoholism since the horrying tragedy, said she hit a low after after the inquest was adjourned in August last year. “I tried to kill myself,” Cherie said. “I jumped from the second floor of St Stephen’s and ended up in a coma for a short while. “I smashed my hip and knee as a result and I still have to use a wheel chair most of the time. “I just wanted to be with Paige. It will sound strange to some people but I felt Paige was calling me. “I had what seemed like a vision and Paige was there saying ‘come with me’. “Luckily, I survived. I know I now need to find a way to move on and stop trying to hurt myself. Cherie previously told Hull Live of her struggles to deal with what happened. “I nearly died because of all this as it tipped me over the edge,” she said back in August. I turned to drink and ended up in hospital. But I haven’t drank now for around ten months. Despite the conclusion into the inquest, Cherie has not got the answers she hoped for. “For Paige it wasn’t suicide, Garry murdered my little girl,” she said. “There is no closure really. He didn’t have to take my little girl. If you want to kill yourself then fine but he didn’t have to take Paige. “I feel numb and didn’t really get the answers I was hoping for. I’m not any nearer where I feel I’m supposed to be.  “I would have preferred a conclusion of suicide for Garry and unlawful killing for Paige rather than a narrative verdict. “But with Garry’s family there too I guess he has to see it from both sides.” Cherie, who was with Bolton for  years, also feels there was little said about Paige at the inquest. She said: “There was nothing really about Paige and how she felt. “At the end of the day Garry took his own le and that of Paige which he had no right or need to do. “Paige was cheeky but also shy. But once she got to know you there was no shutting her up! “I loved her so much and loved buying her things.” The inquest previously heard how Bolton and Cherie had twins Paige and Ethan in  through IVF treatment. Sadly, Ethan died of a heart defect aged just six months, which devastated Garry and Cherie.  Paige’s ashes have now been laid beside Ethan which makes Cherie’s visits to the graveside even more dficult. “I find it very hard visiting the grave as Paige really looked after Ethan’s headstone,” Cherie said “She would clean it every time we went there and would leave toys for Ethan. “Now she is not there to do it bit, instead, lies next to Ethan. Mr Sprakes said he believed Bolton had deliberately started the fire, with no logical explanation for the fire having been started accidentally. Fire crews had to break into the property using a saw and then discovered the two victims lying together in the bathtub. Bolton had locked the front door and made access inside dficult, the inquest heard, and no attempt had been made to contact the emergency services.  Returning a narrative conclusion to the inquest, which started back in August, Mr Sprakes referenced chilling texts sent by Paige to her grandmother before she died saying: Daddy is scaring me. Bolton had also written a note expressing self-harm, the inquest heard. During proceedings in August, Mr Sprakes mentioned text messages Bolton had sent to former partner Cherie, which he decided not to read out but said “amounted to a suicide note”. The inquest had heard how Bolton’s mental health seemed to have deteriorated, having already suffered from anxiety, low self-esteem and paranoia. Independent fire investigator Dr Will Hutchinson carried out an investigation into the blaze and he had also given evidence to the inquest. He had said it was a smouldering fire which meant it took a number of hours to develop. He also indicated such a fire would produce lethal levels of carbon monoxide almost immediately, which could take effect in a matter of minutes. The smoke alarm was also not working, but he could not say for sure whether the fire had been caused accidentally or deliberately.However, Humberside Fire and Rescue Service station manager Richard Gibson believed the cause was deliberate.He said: “I believe the ignition was due to an unspecied naked flame. “As the seat of the fire was in the centre of the bed, it leads me to believe it was deliberate.” Mr Sprakes delivered a narrative verdict. He said: “On January . , Garry Bolton and Paige Bolton died at  Wensley Avenue in Hull between approximately .am and am due to the effects of inhalation of products of combustion and carbon monoxide poisoning due to the effects of a smouldering fire probably deliberately started that morning.” The Samaritans is available  you need to talk.

A senior defence source said he was tearful when his mother told him the newsA source said Prince Andrew was tearful when he was told by the Queen he was being stripped of his military titles Image: Getty ImagesBySean Rayment:,  Jan Prince Andrew was left ­tearful after being told by the Queen he was being stripped of his honorary military titles, it was claimed tonight.The Duke of York was said to be utterly devastated by his mother’s bombshell decision. It came just a fortnight after the Sunday People exclusively revealed Her Majesty would reluctantly strip her son of his prized roleshe did not resign. However Andrew, , did not bite the bullet – and will now have to write grovelling letters to his former ­regiments, it is understood. A senior defence source said: “The Prince was tearful when told the news even though he had expected it. He feels that he has let so many people down, not least his mother, during her Platinum Jubilee year.”  Our source said Andrew’s ousting had been greeted by a huge sigh of relief from armed forces top brass, who described him as “a bloody embarrassment”. The move came after a US judge ruled a civil case in New York against Andrew by his sex accuser Virginia Giuffre can go ahead. Andrew strenously denies any wrongdoing. Our insider said of the royal’s ­dramatic demotion: “He had hoped that he might get some sort of stay of execution and be allowed to clear his name before his titles were removed. “There are a number of people in the royal household who are utterly convinced that he is innocent. “But the clamour for Andrew’s scalp meant that a quick and brutal decision needed to be made.” The move, announced in a shock Palace statement on Thursday, left Andrew exiled from official royal le and facing le as a private citizen.  He was also told he will no longer be able to use the title of His Royal Highness in any official capacity. The move came after years of damaging speculation arising from Ms Giuffre’s claim she was forced to have sex with the duke three times when she was , including once in London. Andrew’s plight worsened when his former friend Ghislaine Maxwell, , was found guilty of offences relating to her work as fixer for the late billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, another Andrew associate. One senior defence source said: “Andrew is a victim of very poor decision-making. There is no way he could continue as the honorary head of distinguished military regiments. “His departure has been greeted with a huge sigh of relief. He had become a bloody embarrassment.  “He could not be present at parades, visit units or welcome troops home from operations because the story would always be about sex scandals and not about the regiments.” The duke, who had a -year active career in the Royal Navy and served as a helicopter pilot in the  Falklands war, held the honorary rank of Colonel of the Grenadier Guards. He was also Colonel-in-chief of the  th Royal Lancers, the Royal Irish Regiment, the Yorkshire Regiment, the Small Arms School Corps, and Royal Colonel of the Royal Highland Fusiliers. Plus he was Honorary Air Commodore of RAF Lossiemouth and Commodore-in-Chief of the Fleet Air Arm. Our source said Andrew is to write to each of the regiments expressing his sorrow at having to leave. “He fully maintains his innocence, but wants to apologise for the ­dficulties caused by what has happened,” the insider added. The Duke has also lost a number of overseas honorary military titles.  He was Colonel-in-Chief of the Queen’s York Rangers , the Royal Highland Fusiliers of Canada, the Princess Louise Fusiliersand Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal New Zealand Army Logistic Regiment. The defence source continued: “The big question now is who is going to fill these roles. “They all need to be filled by senior royals which means Prince Charles, who is extremely busy, Princess Anne who already has  military titles, Prince Edward or Prince William. “Honorary titles are hugely important. The role of Captain General of the Royal Marines was held by Prince Philip for  years. He knew the Royal Marines intimately. “When he handed that role over to Prince Harry his parting words were apparently ‘don’t mess it up’ because it meant so much to him.” But the Queen was reluctantly forced to strip Harry, , of the role because he chose to step down from royal duties when he moved to America with we Meghan. Today Andrew and ex-we Sarah Ferguson, , emerged in public together for the first time since he lost his honorary titles. The couple, who orced in  but remain close, looked sombre as Andrew drove them from his Royal Lodge home in Windsor Great Park. There have also been calls for Andrew to be stripped of his Duke of York title. Andrew took the name, traditionally granted to the monarch’s second son, on his marriage to Sarah in . She is still the Duchess of York. Andrew, whose helicopter acted as a decoy for Argentinian cruise missiles during the Falklands war, will also keep his Royal Navy rank of vice-admiral.

The former married couple who remain close despite their orce in , were seen driving from Royal Lodge, his residence in the grounds of Windsor Great Park in Berkshire. The Queen decided to strip her son of his titles as the legal case being brought by Virginia Gufre over sexual assault allegations presses on in New York. Earlier in the week more than  war veterans had written a strongly-worded public letter to the Queen calling for her to strip her son of his titles. The service personnel, who said they were proud to fight for their country, said it would be inconceivable he would remain in postit were any other senior military officer.  The letter read: Officers of the British armed forces must adhere to the very highest standards of ...honourable conduct. These are standards which Prince Andrew has fallen well short of. We are therefore asking that you take immediate steps to strip Prince Andrew of all his military ranks and titles. We understand that he is your son, but we write to you in your capacity as head of state and as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy and Air Force.  This week Her Majesty did strip her son of his military titles and royal patronages and said he can no longer use the title His Royal Highness. Royal expert Duncan Larcombe told OK! that the Queen will be frustrated with how the situation has been handled, especially on the year of her Diamond Jubilee.Mr Larcombe said: As a mother, this is the stuff of nightmares.The Queen on her Jubilee year, is being hit by this double whammy effect of trouble for the firm and trouble for the family. She has spent so many years building the reputation, and then suddenly it comes out. The Epstein thing has been under the surface for a decade, but it’s now exploded. It’s one disaster after the other.  It has been reported that Sarah Ferguson has no plans to ditch her Duchess title despite Andrew being stripped of his HRH. Friends of Sarah told the Daily Mail she had held the title of duchess since her orce from Andrew and “that is how it will stay”. Andrew is still the Duke of York, so it is not an issue,” they said.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON The QueenSarah FergusonPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old, who remains sixth in line to the throne despite quitting royal duties in , has threatened legal action against the Home Office. He is said to be keen to bring son Archie and daughter Lilibet to visit his homeland, but claims he is unable to do so. Meghan and Archie have not ed to the UK since the couple walked away from royal le in , while Lilibet has yet to set foot in the country where her dad was born. Lawyers acting for the Duke of Sussex say they will seek a judicial reviewcontinued security is not provided when he and his family visit.In a statement his legal team said Harryaposs security was compromised last summer when he unveiled a statue of his mother, Princess Diana, at Kensington Palace. It said that Harry - who inherited a security threat at birth - is unable toto his home with his family, saying they have been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats. Without police protection, lawyers said, bringing Meghan and the children over comes at too great a personal risk. The Duke has ed to the UK twice in the last two years - for the statue unveiling in July last year and Prince Philipaposs funeral three months earlier - but Meghan and the children have stayed in the UK both times. Harry is arguing his private protection team in the US does not have adequate jurisdiction abroad or access to UK intelligence information which is needed keep the Sussex family safe. The UK will always be Prince Harryaposs home and a country he wants his we and children to be safe in, the statement said. The Duke has filed a claim for a judicial review against a Home Office decision not to allow him to personally pay for police protection while in the UK.His representatives said British taxpayers will not have to foot the bill, but said a private security team cannot replicate the protection needed.  It added that he had first offered to pay for police protection for himself and his family in January , but the offer was not accepted. During last summeraposs visit to London, Harryaposs car was chased by photographers - an incident that has made him anxious about his safety. A source told the Mail on Sunday: aposHarryaposs argument in a nutshell is: aposYou got the law wrong.apos He feels the decision to remove his security was wrong. Pre-action protocol was sent by Harryaposs lawyers to the Home Office a couple of months ago. This is essentially a precursor to a judicial review. If the case goes forward it could lead to a legal battle in the High Court between Government ministers and the Duke.  The statement in fullPrince Harry inherited a security risk at birth, for le. He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats. While his role within the institution has changed, his profile as a member of the royal family has not. Nor has the threat to him and his family. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex personally fund a private security team for their family, yet that security cannot replicate the necessary police protection needed whilst in the UK. In the absence of such protection, Prince Harry and his family are unable toto his home. The duke first offered to pay personally for UK police protection for himself and his family in January of  at Sandringham. That offer was dismissed. He remains willing to cover the cost of security, as not to impose on the British taxpayer. As is widely known, others who have left public office and have an inherent threat risk receive police protection at no cost to them. The goal for Prince Harry has been simple - to ensure the safety of himself and his family while in the UK so his children can know his home country.  During his last visit to the UK in July  - to unveil a statue in honour of his late mother - his security was compromised due to the absence of police protection, whilst leaving a charity event. After another attempt at negotiations was also rejected, he sought a judicial review in September  to challenge the decision-making behind the security procedures, in the hopes that this could be re-evaluated for the obvious and necessary protection required. The UK will always be Prince Harryaposs home and a country he wants his we and children to be safe in. With the lack of police protection, comes too great a personal risk. Prince Harry hopes that his petition - after close to two years of pleas for security in the UK - will resolve this situation. It is due to a leak in a UK tabloid, with surreptitious timing, we feel it necessary to release a statement setting the facts straight.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But the important moment – which took place in Angola  years ago this week – might never have happened because Diana and the Red Cross initially wanted to highlight the scourge of mines in Cambodia, but the Foreign Office deemed such a trip too dangerous. At the time, the South East Asian country had an estimated  million landmines – and more than , people had lost limbs because of them. But when the Government said it would be too risky for the princess to visit, Mike Whitlam, then director general of the British Red Cross, suggested Angola – one of the most mined places on Earth – as an alternative.  Trouble had first flared in Angola in , when it declared independence from Portugal. A bloody civil war went on to rage for  years and by the time the violence ended in , an estimated , ­people had lost their lives. Diana’s historic trip to Huambo in January  helped usher in a commitment to rid the world of its wartime landmines. And by the end of that year,  countries had signed the Ottawa Convention, banning the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel mines and committing to their destruction.Sadly, Diana never saw the ­disarmament treaty signed as she was killed in a car crash just three months before it happened.  But the organisations that strived – and still strive – to remove landmines from former war zones are in no doubt about the important role she played. When the historic pictures of Diana in Angola were taken, she was highlighting the work of The HALO Trust – the world’s oldest and largest humanitarian mine ­clearance organisation. Trust spokeswoman Louise Vaughan said: “Once she took those footsteps across that minefield, the conversation changed for ever. “When she visited, it was dangerous. It was an act of incredible bravery that she went there, full-stop. “What Diana did was make it impossible for any government, particularly the British Government, not to support the ban. “She wasn’t responsible for the origin of the campaign to ban landmines, but she gave it a critical ­moment. Nobody could deny that the continuing production and use of landmines was abhorrent and had to change.”  In a speech at Angola’s Luanda Airport, Diana said the purpose of her trip was “to assist the Red Cross in its campaign to ban, once and for all, anti-personnel landmines”. Mike Whitlam says it was unusual for the charity to run any kind of campaign at the time.But after members of the organisation were killed and injured by mines, it decided to take action and push for a ban. As Diana was a patron of the Red Cross, Mike realised he had an ally who could make that call impossible to ignore – and said the princess was “instrumental” when it came to getting landmines banned. Speaking exclusively to the Sunday People, Mike said: “When I started at the Red Cross at the beginning of , almost my first visit was to go and see her. She was a patron we hadn’t made use of.“I said to her, ‘Look, I want you on my side, I want you to get involved really ­heavily’.” But it was only when Mike was walking across a live minefield with Diana that he realised the magnitude of what they were doing. He said: “We were all nervous about doing the walk, but recognised, I think, that it would get global coverage.  “I thought, ‘I’d better walk with Diana becauseshe’s going to get blown up, they better blow me up as well because when I get back my le won’t be worth living’. “She was quite adamant about wanting to do this kind of thing so she could speak about it first-hand. “The whole point of it was to raise the profile. She knew that and that’s exactly what she did. She was pretty well instrumental in making it ­happen globally. “The Foreign Office weren’t keen, but they didn’t get in the way. I’m very honoured to have been part of it and to have had the courage.” Mike wasn’t the only ­person in Angola that day who knew how iconic the pictures of Diana would become. Photographer Anwar Hussein snapped arguably the single most famous image from the visit. Anwar had been taking pictures of Diana since she was first linked to Prince Charles in the early s.  But he knew the moment in the minefield was going to be special. The photographer, now , said: “It was quite an unusual, unique picture and she was quite willing to do it. “This was just after she had finished with Charles. She started doing things on her own – she wanted to prove that she could do things. People criticised her, saying she was doing it to draw the ­attention off her husband. “She was called a loose cannon and all sorts of things like that, but I think she was genuinely interested. She felt very strongly about the cause.” Anwar’s photograph was soon being shared around the world, along with other shots of Diana visiting people who had lost their limbs to landmines. Countless diplomats and organisations – including the International Campaign to Ban Landmines – came together to secure the Ottawa Convention. But to this day, charities say Diana played a pivotal role in bringing the issue to worldwide prominence.  Louise said: “Along with her work on HIV and AIDS, it’s almost certainly Diana’s greatest legacy.”Louise suspects the inspirational moment will feature in the next series of Netflix hit series The Crown – and says The HALO Trust would be happy to help researchers of the show capture the moment authentically.The charity estimates it has removed more than , mines from Angola – and Huambo has even been declared mine-free, with a modern city now standing on the once perilous land.The efficacy of mine clearance was demonstrated in , when Prince Harry ed to the exact spot where his mother once walked when he and his brother William were just  and .Louise said: “Prince Harry was literally walking on Tarmac. There were schools, shops, colleges and children singing a specially composed song to his mother. “He was in the very same place where Diana walked.” Although the Ottawa Convention has been extremely successful in ending the industrial production and use of landmines, The HALO Trust now works to clear homemade improvised explosive devices in countries such as Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. But the organisation still has a huge ­presence in Angola, where it continues to make sure the land is safe. Currently, The HALO Trust employs ­almost  local men and women and is training some all-female teams to clear landmines, empowering women with additional skills, income and status. Louise said: “How amazing that Diana’s legacy is still so meaningful to all of my ­female Angolan ­colleagues – who were born long after she died - who are literally out in that body ­armour on a hillside in Angola right now, clearing mines.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON International Campaign to Ban LandminesForeign OfficeRed CrossPrince HarryPrince Charles, Prince of WalesPrincess DianaThe CrownRoyal FamilyCivil warSTDsSunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This week Her Majesty stripped Prince Andrew of all of his military titles and His Royal Highness title. And now, pubs across the UK are considering whether their establishments should get rebranded. But punter Lawrence Ockleford said: ‘It’s only a title. Obviously what he has been accused of is not good, but you can’t really erase the history.  I think you shouldn’t glory him as a person but it’s OK to keep the names. George Cork, the general manager of The Duke of York pub in Southwark, London said he would not be changing the name of his pub. There’s no plans to change the name.  The Duke of York has been called The Duke of York for a long time now – it’s about a title and the original Duke of York from the s. Everyone’s entitled to their opinion, but he’s not affiliated with us in any way. The pub’s been around for a long time and there are  pubs around the UK that probably feel the same way.

The move means Andrew has been completely removed from official royal le and he now have to face his future as an ­ordinary citizen. The scandal-hit Duke of York was informed that he will no longer use the title of His Royal Highness in any official capacity by the Queen on Thursday. It was another body blow after discovering the day before that New York judge Lewis Kaplan ruled Andrew must face a civil trial on allegations he ­sexually abused Virginia Giuffre when she was . He denies the accusations.

After hours of deliberation with other senior members of the Firm, a -minute meeting signalled the end of public royal le. But the summit is said to have not been straight-forward, with his lawyer left in the car park and the Prince left stunned by the outcome. Here are the six key revelations from Windsor Castle as it was decided the “axe should swtly fall” on Andrew’s royal career.aposFuriousapos Williamaposs part  Prince William has been ­“incandescent” at how his uncle has behaved throughout the legal saga. The Queen ruthlessly made her mind up on Wednesday, and she had some help coming to her conclusion.The Mirror ­understands the irate Duke is angry at his uncle for bringing the Royal Family into disrepute. A source said: “The Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge are completely aligned in their view that the Duke of York has presided over a complete and utter disaster.” It is believed detailed discussions within the family had been going on for weeks with William aware action was required.Andrew aposshell-shockedapos by decision  Andrew did not see the decision coming and one source described him as being “shell-shocked” at the move. The ruthless call came less than  hours after New York judge Lewis Kaplan ruled Andrew must face a civil trial. He denies the accusations. The source said he was stunned and added: “Given the robustness with which Judge Kaplan greeted our ­arguments, we are ­unsurprised by the ruling. “However, it was not a judgement on the merits of Ms Giuffre’s ­allegations. The Duke will continue to defend himself against these claims.” Queen told Andrew face-to-face  The Queen is understood to have broken the decision to middle son Andrew face-to-face. During a private audience, the monarch told her son he will no longer be known as His Royal Highness in any official capacity — and will be left to fight his lawsuit as a private citizen. Looking stony-faced, the Duke of York was driven a few miles from his house, Royal Lodge, to Windsor Castle on Thursday morning for the -minute sit down with his mum. She informed him of the decision and an official announcement was made hours later. Andrew apostried to bring lawyerapos to summit Prince Andrew attempted to bring his personal lawyer to the summit, sources say. He was driven to Windsor Castle by his brief Gary Bloxsome, but he was swtly told he would not be allowed inside with him. Instead, he waited outside in the car, the Daily Mail reports. Mr Bloxsomeaposs involvement may indicate Andrew had been taking legal advice before facing his mum. Queenaposs aposfinancial lelineaposPrince Andrew fears financial ruin amid the on-going sex case.

She met David McDermott at a pub in summer  and they began a relationship in  just weeks after her th birthday. But the -year-old was furious after the -year-old ended their relationship and smashed windows at his ex-partneraposs home. Before their affair, Armes and McDermott knew each other from Eccles College, where he had been her student support officer.And their relationship started after the pair later met at a pub, the Manchester Evening News reports. Armes followed him outside and told him she had aposfantasisedapos about the pair having sex, prosecutor Gavin Howie told Manchester Crown Court. He says that he took her to the Ivy Mount Hotel and had sex with her, Mr Howie said, according to Manchester Evening News.The following day, he says, he transferred money to her bank account for drugs she supplied him. Mr Howie said Mr McDermott admitted he had been drinking heavily and took cocaine, which the man put down to his poor mental health. His mental health continued to be an issue after their first encounter, Mr Howie added. He says he was struggling with his mental health so he went to Benidorm [alone] and drank and took drugs, the prosecution added. He received a payment of four pence and one pence [from the defendant] saying aposcall me nowapos and aposbell me nowapos. He says she came to Benidorm but, he says, nothing happened while she was there. After the trip, Armes, of St Marys Road, Eccles, rang Mr McDermottaposs ex-partner — the mother of his children. Following this, contact between the pair ceased for some weeks until Armes emailed Mr McDermott in September , claiming to be apossleeping roughapos. He did not reply, Mr Howie told Her Honour Manley. He rang her the following day and told her to stop emailing.  They arranged a meeting in the Milton Hotel [in order] to aposget what she wantedapos. They had unprotected sex. She was annoyed that he brought protection.She then placed material on Facebook saying she was pregnant.This incident was the last time the pair had sex, as Mr McDermott told Armes to stop contacting him. In November , Armes then messaged his ex-partner about their relationship, who confronted him. Armes also told his employer and McDermott was later sacked from this position for gross misconduct. Despite this, Armes continued to message and call Mr McDermott — leading him to change his mobile number three times, after she repeatedly contacted him on unknown numbers, or by using someone ’s phone. The court heard how Armes later went to his ex-partner’s house while Mr McDermott was visiting, then damaged windows, and scratched the word ‘nonce’ into his car bonnet. The window damage came to £ and car damage to £. Representing Armes was Jayne Miller, who told the court her client had a troubled upbringing, with the family forced to relocate to Wales after being fire-bombed. “She has had a dficult background,” Ms Miller said. “Her family were firebombed, and were moved out of Salford to Wales, into a one-bedroom property and [were] not able to leave each others’ company, being protected by the safeguarding team. “She came back one year later and went to a dferent school. She is young and socially isolated and has what appears to be emotionally unstable personality disorder.” Ms Miller added that Armes now says she ‘hates’ Mr McDermott, and does not wish to be in contact with him again. Sentencing her to a community order and restraining order, judge Hilary Manley said she offered Armes ‘a chance’. “You are clearly remorseful and have made efforts to improve your future,” she said. “There can be no excuse for harassing any person. It is totally destructive and pointless. Your actions also caused distress to his children. That is unacceptable. I am giving you this chance. Do not squander it.” Armes pleaded guilty to one count of stalking. She was sentenced to a two-year community order, with  rehabilitation days, and handed an indefinite restraining order against the victim and his family.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BenidormCrown court\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Amy Gillingham, , moved from Southport moved to the Middle Eastern country in  after being offered a job as a PE teacher in the Middle Eastern country.She took the dream job but is now creating history in a dream role after she became the first female commentator on a major football event in the UAE earlier this month. As a youngster Amy played for Liverpool Feds and FC United of Manchesteraposs womenaposs football teams before making the move abroad. But her big break came while she was waiting for her car to be washed. She was playing football with some of the local kids and staff when a man approached her. They chatted about the game for ten minutes when he revealed he worked for a TV company and offered her a chance to work on a UAE football match in the future.Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, Amy said: So originally I came out here as a PE teacher working in the government schools. I was a little bit more than a PE teacher as I was looking after schools. Iaposd go in, help and support the PE teachers, upskill them and then develop the curriculum. I moved out here around five years ago and moving on from that Iaposve always loved my football. I was getting my car washed one day. I was waiting for my car to be done when I started playing football with some of the workers and children that were there and then a chap came over and we started talking all things football. He said that he did this, that and the other working in the football commentary world and askedI would be interested. I was like aposye, of course, football is my dream!apos. Anything to do with football, talking about football, is an absolute dream come true. A couple of months went by and I just thought it must have been put to bed and may happen in the near future. Then a couple of weeks ago I got a phone call asking me to commentate on the Super Cup Final which is a huge game out here for the local professional league. I did that and now Iaposve signed a contract with the UAE Pro League commentating within the league. Itaposs mental! Amy has been obsessed with the sport since she was a kid, with her competitiveness stemming from her relationship with her older brother. She officially became the first female commentator in the UAE on Friday, January  when Al Jazira took on Shabab Al-Ahli. She co-commentated with journalist and broadcaster Graham Clews ahead of signing a contract with the UAE Pro League. She said: Iaposve got an older brother so we were always kicking a ball about in the back garden with him and that led on to playing in school, then local clubs in Southport such as Birkdale and Southport FC. From there I ventured out to Liverpool where I played for Liverpool Feds. I then went to Manchester to play for FC United of Manchester. Iaposve always been involved in football and from there got into coaching roles and when I was in university Iaposd support local schools with coaching. Itaposs always been there. Itaposs in my blood, to be honest.

As most residents slept soundly, a car sped down the hill, which is known to be icy, toward the junction. Instead of slowing and turning, the car shoots across the road and into the parked car opposite. It hits the vehicle with such force that it shunts the car through the front of the house, smashing the wall and window inwards.  Then, the driver can be seen leaping from the wreckage, and running away. Emergency services were called to the road at am today, to be greeted by the horric crash scene. Thankfully no one was hurt, but neighbours were awoken by the sound of the impact and the car alarm that followed. A number of residents went to investigate and were shocked to find the car empty, with the airbags activated and the keys still in the ignition.  They tried to alert the people inside the home, thankfully, all of whom were uninjured. When emergency services arrived, the road was blocked off and police attempted to locate the driver.The damage to the house is not believed to be structural and West Midlands police are continuing their inquiries to locate the driver.They have urged anyone with information to come forward.  A West Midlands Police spokesperson said: We were called to Cheverton Road, Birmingham at am this morning to reports a car had collided with another car that had crashed into the side of a house. The occupants of the house were not hurt and there is not believed to be any structural damage to the house. Enquiries are ongoing to trace the driver of the car who left before emergency services attended the scene.

Crystal Dominguez claims she started having irregular periods, sharp stomach pains and abdominal swelling back in late  but was told by doctors that she just needed to lose weight. Her stomach swelled so badly she looked like she was expecting triplets. The -year-old said her stomach ballooned so large that people thought she was expecting and kept asking aposwhen are you due apos, so to avoid aposuncomfortableapos questions and stares she became housebound for months. But just when the singleton had aposlost hopeapos of receiving help, a aposbasketball-sizedapos cyst was eventually discovered on her oy in October , which was surgically removed shortly after. Crystal, who works in social media marketing and is a passionate advocate for womenaposs health care, urges other women to get their symptoms checked out andthey feel like theyaposre not being heard - visit another doctor. Crystal, of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, US, said: When I got my scans they told me my cyst was the size of a basketball and a week later when I got out of surgery Iaposd lost  pounds of fluid from my stomach. After my surgery my surgeon came into my room and told me that I was lucky becausethat cyst would have ruptured they would not have been able to save me because it was that big. A cyst can rupture doing anything and at that time I was going to the gym twice a day. It was a ticking time bomb, she said. It was crazy. I feel like that was a sign that Iaposm meant to be on this earth to hopefully help someone  because I could have died in so many ways and I didnapost. The college graduate said she went to the doctor when she first developed symptoms and was told that they were aposnormalapos due to her birth control. Crystal said: My periods were very irregular and always heavy. I had weight gain in my stomach. It would never go away and it wasnapost normal fat where Iaposd have rolls. My stomach was very hard and smooth. It looked really round to the point where I looked like I was pregnant with like three babies beyond full term. I also had very sharp stomach pains. It wouldnapost be all the time it was sometimes in my lower stomach and then it was really tight.  Crystal claims that after having her birth control removed her symptoms persisted and she ed to the doctors who advised her that just needed to lose weight. Crystal said: The doctors essentially said aposyouaposre just fatapos. They sent me to a nutritionist and that was it. That was basically their version of saying that I was big and thataposs all. A lot of them told me that I needed to start to work out and change my eating habits. They didnapost even bother to examine my stomach.  I explained my symptoms to them but I felt like they wouldnapost hear me or care. I also felt like I wasnapost heard because of me being a mixed [race] woman. I felt like they didnapost pay attention to me. It was really hard and depressing. I went to doctors and they really just convinced me I was fat. I wouldnapost leave the house because I was embarrassed. I went to the gym twice a day. I ate but didnapost eat enough. I was always like aposok, I canapost eat because Iaposm too fatapos. Crystal said that the weight of the cyst meant that her back hurt all the time and she couldnapost stand for long periods. She said: Everybody thought I was carrying a child so then theyaposd always ask me questions like aposoh my God, youaposre pregnant  When are you due apos and things like that which made me uncomfortable to the point I didnapost leave the house for months. People would stare and come up to me and touch my stomach and it would just be very uncomfortable. I would tell them I wasnapost pregnant and it would just get awkward and weird. I didnapost even want to go to the doctor anymore because I lost hope. But my mom was like aposno, weaposre going to go to the doctor one last time and they are going to do somethingapos. I was relieved [to receive diagnosis] because I was like aposok, this is good because Iaposm not crazyapos. Something was wrong with me when all these doctors made me feel really crazy but then also it was really terrying because I was like aposoh my Gosh, that is hugeapos. Crystal said her oian cystadenoma diagnosis arose after she visited another doctor who could see how round her stomach was so gave her an ultrasound in October . This was followed by a scan two days later and she had surgery to remove the fluid along with one of her oies that had been aposcrushedapos by the cyst a week later. It was then sent off to ensure it wasnapost cancerous and it was discovered to be benign. The -year-old said it took her three to four weeks to be able to walk again and she was fully healed after around eight weeks. Crystal said: Once it was removed it was super scary because the cyst pushed out all my organs and ribs so afterwards was horrible. I would stand up and it would feel like all of my organs were coming out of my body and it was painful because they were trying to move back in my body. I felt my insides move and itaposs just the weirdest feeling to describe. At first I was really embarrassed [to share experience online] because of my photos I thought I looked really fat but I have to realise that I survived this and went through this for a reason and I truly believe that my reason was to be able to help someone . Iaposd say to other women that you know your body better than anyone  in the whole world andyou feel like something is wrong please, from the bottom of my heart, go and get checked out. Anda doctor doesnapost listen to you, go to someone  and keep doing that until you find someone. You have to fight for yourself.

While people as far away as Australia and Italy have been captivated by the stand-off, theyaposre also offering Jessica and Nikki light-hearted solutions to end the stalemate. The plans include digging a tunnel underneath the ground to extract the blender from below, and even buying three more blenders, so they can give each cat a perch and rescue the original utensil they are still yet to use. The saga even attracted the attention of Vitamix, the company that produces the blender, which tried to offer a solution and sent an identical blender box to the household. Although Jessica admitted she and Nikki could end appliancegate by lting the cats off the box, fans have asked them to let the cats carry on purely for the entertainment factor. She said: Certainly we could relocate them. They donapost weigh a ton. It would be very easy to pick whoeveraposs on the box up and put them on the floor and open the box. But why would we end something that is bringing us so much laughter  Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Animals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In a post on Reddit, the bride said: [My brothers] never had a good relationship because they never wanted my mum and dad to separate in the first place. They resented my stepdad and limited contact once they moved out. However, while the older brothers cut ties with their stepdad, the bride explains she continued to foster a relationship with him as she spent more time with him.  She wrote: We established a somewhat stable relationship. The bride added her stepdad had helped her out with her schooling, and that he had even offered to fund her wedding. Iaposm very grateful for that though it was his decision, she wrote. She then explains she sent her older brothers invitations to the wedding - but as soon as they found out their stepdad was attending, they said they might not come. After taking time to think, the bride says her brothers confronted her with an ultimatum - that they wouldnapost attend the weddingtheir stepdad was also going.  She wrote: I literally freaked out because I definatelywant my brothers to be at my wedding so badly and I tried talking to them but they were being stubborn. After talking to my fiance I had no choice but to politely un-invite my stepdad and sending him an email stating why. After sending the email, the bride claims her mum called her and shouted at her, suggesting she was ungrateful for excluding her stepdad after everything heaposs done for her. She claims she explained to her mum that her brothers had given her an ultimatum, but her mum wasnapost buying her excuse. Instead, she scolded her daughter for prioritising her hateful and cold-hearted brothers over her stepdad and showing she was not worthy of his grace. The bride said it was really really hurtful for her to hear her mumaposs harsh words. After she hung up I asked my fianceI made the wrong decision and he said itaposs my wedding and I get to decide, she wrote. However, she added her fiancé is biased and is expected to be on her side. After asking for opinions on whether or not she was in the wrong, people commented on her story to give their verdict. One person said the bride was in the wrong for letting her brothers control her decision. They wrote: Your mothers words hurt because they are true. Another said: I would understandthe step dad was abusive or condescending. But this time it’s on the brothers.

What do you think of the sighting  Let us know in the comments...Sharing a picture, the user asked: Ufo or rock  Antarctica google earth.UFO sightings have been on the rise in the past few years, as recently an airman witnessed a aposUFOapos while he was guarding nuclear weapons at a US Air Force base - adding that heaposs seen aposshadow peopleapos at similar installations.Former USAF nuclear weapons technician Adrian Reister said that between  and  he was stationed at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, where he would guard, maintain, and move nuclear weapons.

Beena told her children to stay away and did some research, and it emerged that the egg had turned pink due to a bacteria that can lead to serious illness in humans. What do you think of the pink egg  Let us know in the comments...Beena said: I fancied some egg yesterday and cracked open the egg in the frying pan as normal. Then as it fell into the pan I screamed as I have never seen a pink egg before. The kids came running to see what had happened and their reaction was typical, [they went] aposerrrrapos. Beena then found that the other eggs were completely fine - but it was something she had definitely never seen before. She added: I then cracked the other two eggs from the same box but they were normal. It was really weird because they were in date and just the last few left. Bought them from the local Asda in Watford. It did put me off for a second but after that everyone fancied some egg on toast! According to the US Department of Agriculture, a cloudy egg white is a sign the egg is very fresh, and a clear egg white is an indication the egg is ageing. But Pink or pearly egg whites indicate spoilage due to Pseudomonas bacteria, which can lead to headaches, swelling, and even pneumonia.

Irish police are continuing to hunt for the killer of Ashling Murphy who was found dead on Wednesday after going for a run on the banks of the Grand Canal in Cappincur, Tullamore.In The Late Late Show’s tribute to Ashling, traditional Irish musicians joined together to celebrate their music and memorialise the primary school teacher, RSVP reports. Mike Hanrahan from Stocktonaposs Wing, Beogaaposs Niamh Dunne, Dara and Mick Healy from Boxing Banjo, Bridín, Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh and Séamus and Caoimhe Ui Fhlatharta were present in the musical sessions. Many people pointed out a touching part of the tribute with a chair holding a fiddle and bow dedicated to Ashling, who absolutely loved her fiddle. One person wrote: “The empty chair for Aisling is both devastating and beautul.” A second viewer said: “The empty chair for Aisling is beautul but heartbreaking. Ireland united in grief for its devastating loss.” A third commenter shared: “Powerful soothing soulful traditional music and song on The @RTELateLateShow tonight to remember, celebrate and offer sympathies for the beautul le of Ashling Murphy that was taken so senselessly. “The fiddle on the empty chair was such a poignant image.” Those who watched the moving performances shared how heartbreaking the programme was.  One RTE viewer said: “Beautul  moving musical tribute to Ashling Murphy on the #Latelateshow. Heartbreaking to see empty chair with fiddle.” A second person wrote: “The empty chair  fiddle is truly heartbreaking. Rest in Peace Ashling Murphy”. Attracta Brady, who was Ms Murphyaposs first fiddle teacher, played alongside other sombre performers at a vigil on Friday evening. She was the most beautul girl inside and out, Ms Brady said.  She was a parentaposs dream. She was everything youaposd want in a daughter. She had integrity, she was honest, she was trustworthy. She was quirky and a little bit cheeky sometimes with the loveliest smile and sheaposd get away with it because she had this beautul twinkly smile. She was never in bad humour, she was always smiling and she absolutely loved her fiddle. Her parents only told me yesterday that she never had to be told to practice. She was bright and energetic and everybody loved her. Police arrested a man following the attack, although he has since been released and is no longer a suspect in the case, the Irish Mirror reports.Officers yesterday announced that a new suspect has been identied and a new line of inquiry is being followed.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON MurderPoliceCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

That aside, it was a strong year for the driver.Argyll rally fans are looking forward to a full  season, Covid permitting, in conjunction with Dunfermline Car Club and the new main title sponsors Burnside Piling.CAPTIONS:Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen CR MAX.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files january 7 2022","story":"Machrihanish and Islay topped the highest gusts of wind recorded in the west of Scotland on Tuesday.Throughout the early

speed-related accidents.Argyll and Bute Council#s roads director Alistair Gow told councillors that use of both fixed and portable cameras to detect speeding had increased dramatically in the last few years.They had been pioneered by the former Strathclyde Regional Council which had paid for their purchase and installation with the police meeting the running costs.From the limited information available, an average drop of  per cent in injury accidents was being achieved where they were being used in the UK.#A substantial proportion of injury accidents within Argyll and Bute are speed related and in view of the above statistics, remote speed enforcement could substantially reduce the occurrence of accidents of this nature,# he said.#There are other types of equipment available which are not intended to operate as enforcement tools, but instead to convey a visual message to speeding motorists. This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet.

Everyone at some point must do a reckoning of le its purpose and meaning, or apparent lack thereof. The current pandemic, which frames this absorbing work, is only one example of a situation in which we discover our limitations, and are shaken by our vulnerability and inadequacy.Considering Covid’s echoes of plagues in previous centuries, Ignatieff reflects: “Instead of running forward, time seemed to be running backward to a past we thought was irrevocably behind us ... We had so much less control of history than we supposed, so much less control of illness than we imagined. The speed with which our society was brought to a standstill acted to humble us all and put into question every secular faith.”On Consolation is a book about faith and belief, not all of it religious. Written for a secular age, its starting point was a lecture Ignatieff was asked to give about justice and politics in the Book of Psalms. Although he is not religious, the depth of comfort he found in this poetic collection of ideas and exhortations enticed him to explore the history of consolation. The result is an account, necessarily concise and incomplete, of some of the most enduring words, concepts, images and music that have sustained previous generations, as well as our own.Author Michael Ignatieff A novelist, writer, academic and former leading politician, Ignatieff brings all his talents to bear on the subject. Recalling the deaths of his parents  years ago, his sorrow remains tangible. This might explain his awareness that “consolation may be the work of a letime”.By taking the Books of Job and the Psalms as a starting point he confirms that, for millennia, people have yearned to make sense of their afflictions. Even rock-solid assurance in the ine cannot entirely quash the doubts assailing those who face illness, torment, loss, or their own imminent death. The reason these two particular texts retain their power, he suggests, “is their extraordinary capacity to give words to our own doubts, our maddening sense of the inscrutability of the world, the absence of justice, the cruelty of fate, and our longing for a world where our experience finds validation and meaning”.The authors of these books will never be known, but Ignatieff soon turns to some of the most influential writers who left their reflections on coping with the hand le deals us. Almost inevitably, most are male until the last century, although not mentioning the deathbed revelations of the medieval mystic Julian of Norwich – “All shall be well, all shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well” – feels like an oversight.The thinkers, rebels and artists who fill these pages create a chorus, each voice attempting to understand the world around – and possibly beyond – them. Not until philosopher David Hume, however, is God, and the salve of Paradise, consigned to history. Air and honesty enter the picture with Hume, who rebelled against the “ comforts” of religion, and went to his death with a tranquillity of spirit that infuriated and baffled his doctrinal foes.Hume’s insistence on the importance of society, work and friendship is the hinge on which modern conceptions of solace swing. Harsher political creeds have since tried to sweep away all existential comfort, with philosophers such as Karl Marx and Max Weber certain, for dfering reasons, that they lived in a post-consolation age. Nevertheless, their blinkered idealism or bleakness has been confounded by poets and writers, including Primo Levi and Anna Akhmatova, who have acted almost as recording angels, capturing the depths of human cruelty for future generations.Perhaps most persuasive of all is the role music plays in sustaining those who are sorrowing and afraid. Describing Beethoven’s instinctual response to a mother’s grief, and Mahler’s songs, composed in memory of his eight siblings who died in childhood – he could never directly write about his young daughter’s death from scarlet fever – Ignatieff writes: “Mahler shared Wagner’s conviction that music should attempt nothing less than to provide meaning for men and women living after the death of the gods. … As in Kindertotenlieder, as in the final bars of his ninth symphony, Mahler brings the listener and the music to the very edge of silence, asto mark the place where music’s consoling work has to end, and the listener must go on to find a meaning of his own.”From Cicero to Albert Camus to the physician Cicely Saunders, whose London hospice helped thousands to experience the richness of “a good death”, Ignatieff teases out the distinction between those who leaned on the prospect of an afterle and others who have navigated by means of political ideologies or artistic vision. Or, in the case of Saunders, in easing the way for others to confront the finality of le.As this probing and personal work approaches its terminus, it becomes clear that Ignatieff’s purpose has been not only to synthesise centuries of soul-searching, but to make his own contribution. After reading the thoughts of those on the brink of death, or in deepest despair, he finds his own definition of consolation: “What do we learn that we can use in these times of darkness  Something very simple, we are not alone, and we never have been.”"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-no-matter-might-say-devo-max-just-isnt-going-happen","story":"If unionists had taken up Alex Salmond’s offer to place a third option on the  ballot , it would have won, but it is much less popular or credible now, as the Tories have opened our eyes to the reality of Westminster “sovereignty”.Westminster has acceded to Ireland’s right of self-determination with Labour neutral on Irish unication, while denying to Scotland the  year-old tradition of its sovereignty .

Well, devo max certainly wasnt included on the SNP manesto last May, when the party of independence won what Mr Macwhirter admits was a \"landslide victory\". And I can honestly say, hand on heart, that whenever Ive been out campaigning, I have never once met a voter who talked to me about devo max, and they are the people who really count.However, I have met voters who are disillusioned, angry, and want to kick themselves for swallowing Gordon Browns Vow and voting No in , resulting in Scotland being hauled out of the EU against our wishes and being stuck with treacherous Boris Johnson and his terrible Tories whom we never voted for and I detect a growing determination from the voters that they wont be taken for a ride again by politicians in thrall to Westminster, coupled with a growing realisation that only independence will deliver Scotlands future into Scotlands hands.Ruth Marr, Stirling.STURGEON NEEDS JOHNSON IN OFFICENICOLA Sturgeon calls for Boris Johnsons resignation after his Downing Street lockdown party last May. But really  Whatever she publicly states, she surely very much prefers him in situ Ms Sturgeon has long since struggled, using rational economic arguments, to persuade Scots that UK break-up would be beneficial.

These offered a vivid picture of the burdens carried by classroom teachers – particularly meaningless paperwork, the slogans and “corporate speak” which are often used to impose and enforce ill-considered, centralised innovations while disguising their frequent failures and their destructive waste of precious teaching and learning time.However, as a fairly modern commentator on Scottish education, Mr McLennan seems to have missed the point that it “was ever thus”. He made only a few selective references to past changes in Scottish education: the raising of the school leaving age in , the end of corporal punishment and Curriculum for Excellence. If, however, he delved more thoroughly into the last  years of centrally imposed changes – not least the Primary Memorandumand the horrendous Millennium chaos of Higher Still – he would surely see that our current dficulties of low educational morale are profound precisely because they have developed over such a long time.It will take very brave, honest, and determined collaboration from educationalists and politicians to define these problems, confront them and implement educational solutions. And, in my opinion, nobody has volunteered so far.Most teachers have their own particular concerns and Mr McLennan is entitled to his – although his conflation of what he calls “nationalism”, history lessons and attainment was beyond my understanding. As far as I know, the story of the st Highland Division in  at St Valery en Caux is presented by all historians as an example of ordinary soldiers’ nobility and courage in the midst of lethal chaos in  Glasgow University publicly apologised for its links to the slave trade and set up a reparative justice scheme with £ million.These examples certainly do not make the case for suggesting history teachers promote Scottish “exceptionalism” or for denying our children’s right to know all their nation’s history – good and bad. Providing an objective timeline of events would surely support understanding of time and place in other areas of the curriculum. However, whether Mr McLennan likes it or not, that timeline will include Wallace, Glencoe, Darien, Fletcher of Saltoun, Culloden and the aftermath, the Clearances and more modern events which might well arouse further anger. Editing such history, as I think he acknowledges in terms of Japan, won’t stop young people reacting to injustice and corruption or demanding change.Indeed, as he acknowledges that there could indeed be more lessons on Scottish history, Mr McLennan will need to investigate other reasons for our young people’s enthusiasm for Scottish independence. It could be, for instance, quite simply, current, rather than past, events. This is the Greta Thunberg generation who will make their own dramatic history as they tackle climate change, massive human migrations, environmental destruction, pandemic emergencies and the collapse of bioersity. Any review of educational policies and attainment needs to take account of what to offer them in terms of learning to cope with all of that.As pupils of the s and s my generation of teachers worked in Scottish schools from the s and survived many stormy changes. I can understand many of Mr McLennan’s frustrations, which are probably shared by most current teachers. I just think it is a shame his argument was dominated and confused by his references to his version of “nationalism”. Unlike Mr McLennan, I support independence for Scotland, but  improving educational attainment for every child is a separate issue.Frances McKie, Evanton.LODGE IS DOING A BORISI REFER to last week’s report about my efforts to secure a fair settlement for my community from the Masonic Grand Lodge of Scotland.The quote from Mr Semple, the Grand Secretary, about having no objection in principle, but hands being tied by issues of governance, is risible. The “laws” of GLS have no statutory basis and are purely self-devised and applied. To maintain that there is no measure of discretion available is simply another example of disingenuousness. It is in effect saying that our rules, which we made up, are preventing us from doing the right and honourable thing. They might have as well used the classic excuse that “a big boy did it and ran away”.They are in effect doing a “Boris” just brass it out and maintain that there is nothing to see here, and rely on flimsy excuses, which can then be repeated ad nauseum. End result is that they get away with “daylight robbery”, but can still sleep easily.Much has been said recently about the Masonic movement wanting to change its image, and here was a perfect opportunity to let actions speak louder than words. I genuinely have no hidden agenda. My concern was purely to attract inward investment to help prevent the recognised issue of rural depopulation. Instead GLS has walked off with the money, but is “sympathetic” to our plight.I would confirm that as Mr Semple stated, I do not represent anyone from the former Lodge Blackadder. Indeed the support of those lodge members was withdrawn only recently, after they had each been contacted by GLS staff.I can only hope that grass-root membership of GLS express their views about the disgraceful behaviour of their Grand leadership.Gerry McCann, Greenlaw, Berwickshire.WE NEED DEPENDABLE POWER STATIONSTHE UK Government needs to prioritise people’s needs for warm homes, affordable fuel and jobs over doubtful claims about the future of the planet . In any event, our climate change policy is pointless while the Chinese, Indians and others massively increase their burning of fossil fuels.Because we cannot store large amounts of electricity, we need real power stations, which are available whether the wind blows or not. In the short run, we will need to start building new gas-fired power stations. On a clear site, these can be built in as little as  months.Longer term, we need a new generation of nuclear power stations that can provide carbon-free power for generations. The modular design championed by Rolls-Royce offers the chance to build these far quicker and at a far lower price than was previously possible.For gas, we need strategic storage to protect us from foreign action and spikes in wholesale prices. We also need to start fracking to give us a secure domestic source of gas.VAT holidays and other symptomatic relief for utility bills are just not enough.Otto Inglis, Crossgates, Fe."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13378106.jpg?type=article-full","title":"2022-year-tv-reboots-spin-offs-big-farewells","story":"What can we expect  Alongside plenty of new shows to indulge in, there will be reboots and revivals, as well as a few farewells.Among those making a comeback is Borgen.

It is now Bute House, the official residence of Scotland’s First Minister.But despite a reputation as one of the city’s grand residences, Cammo House and its carefully cultivated grounds drted into sad neglect, with odd tales swirling around its reclusive owners and packs of wild dogs that roamed its rooms and covered once luxurious floors with stinking excrement.A target for vandals and fires, by the late s the crumbling house was demolished and the estate passed into the care of Edinburgh City Council to become the UK’s first Wilderness Park.These its well-worn paths and leafy woodland is familiar territory for walkers and dog lovers, with little left to show for the owners and the countless servants whose devoted efforts kept it in impressive style for decades.All that remains of the once impressive property is a door frame surrounded by stones.Amateur diggers from the EAFS began digging at the estate in . Many of the items they have since uncovered have been linked to Margaret Wright, the Cammo House cook and housekeeper described in her obituary as a “faithful servant for  years”.Along with her dishes, pots and pans, ink bottles to jot down recipes and letters, are personal objects such as hairpins,  teeth and tonic bottles which once contained seaweed tonic and embrocation, telling of the physical toll of her work and the likely dampness of her abode.At odds with the simple objects, are ious champagne bottles, hinting at the grand lestyles of the estate’s owners.Although simple items, Ian Hawkins, honorary secretary of the EAFS, says they help build a picture of the many servants whose lives were as much entwined with the estate as the well-to-do in the grand house.“It was a very large house which at one stage had something like  or more rooms,” he says.“There would have been quite a lot of servant staff at the house at one time, but by , census records show there was only Margaret Wright left.“We found she was originally from Monymusk in Aberdeen. By , she had ed there and died.”Although just a scrap of information, Margaret’s story sheds some light on the le and the changing fortunes of a lost estates plagued by scandal, inheritance feuds with eccentric owners.The grand house at its heart was built in , after owner John Menzies commissioned architect Robert Mylne, whose achievements included the design for Blackfriars Bridge in London.With  bedrooms and  rooms with fires including public rooms, a smoking room and billiards room, it dominated the sprawling grounds close to Cramond Brig.The mansion underwent ious improvements before being bought in  by Margaret Maitland-Tennent, whose father had made his fortune from sheep farming in Australia.Her family would become the estate’s last residents, who drove it into neglect with their eccentric behaviour.Having sparked scandal by orcing her husband in  after a chaotic marriage troubled by rows over his entitlement to her inheritance, Margaret lived at Cammo with her two sons, Robert and Percival.They had embarked on a grand tour to New Zealand, Australia and Japan in , only for Robert to suddenly decide he was not ing home – a move that saw him written out of his mother’s will.Known to locals as ‘the Black Widow’ because she would be driven into town to shop in Jenners in a car with black curtains drawn, Margaret and son Percival rarely left the estate.Her wealth was a mystery too: she once spent the night behind bars after refusing to ulge details of her funds in American and Canadian banks.Percival, meanwhile, had a love of cars, which he drove around the estate and then dumped to rot. Several car parts have been found by the archaeology team.Eventually mother and son were living in a cottage near the once grand house while packs of stray dogs collected by Percival roamed its huge rooms.Margaret died in  aged , and was buried on the estate near the house – the last person in Edinburgh to be buried on private property. “However, the grave was not secure and her body was later exhumed and moved to Dean Cemetery,” adds Ian.The entire estate passed to Percival, who continued to let the house fall into ruin. Dogs, vandals, burglars and fireraisers caused massive damage, leaving valuables ruined and expensive artworks damaged.The house was bequeathed to the National Trust for Scotland after Percival’s death in , but it was so rotten and rat-infested that it had to be demolished.A few remaining artworks and furnishings which had survived were sold at auction, among them an th century Italian work which fetched £ in  – equating to around £, today.The EAFS archaeologists are made up of volunteers from around the country who regularly travel to the site to carry out excavations. Their latest digs have concentrated on the servants’ accommodation, workshops, the steadings and piggery.Mr Hawkins said although the items being found are relatively small, they build up a picture of le behind the scenes at the intriguing estate.“We are finding pottery, plates, cups and bottles. The loss of this house is within living memory, and it will be interesting to see what  we find.”"},{"url":null,"title":"d-day-looms-future-top-league-swf-pitch---alan-campbell","story":"The latter held two meetings on Friday. The first, with the chief executives of Hearts and Hibernian among the attendees, was with the SWPL  clubs – and it was followed by another with the seven SWPL  clubs.SWF chief executive Aileen Campbell said: “I outlined our proposals for new staff structures, increased staff capacity and a dedicated SWPL board to give clubs and players substantial voice and a real sway.“SWF wants to take an inclusive approach to the SWPL, drawing on its own experiences and blending it with the knowledge of our clubs, the perspective of our players, the expertise of our partners, and guided by an independent and effective board chair.“I have never seen my role, or that of SWF, as being solely about league administration or  minutes on the pitch. Womens football and the SWPL are much more important than that.“Our aim is to develop, build upon, and sustain an ever-strengthening narrative to entice interest and resources into our game. I sincerely appreciated the attention of senior representatives from all Scotlands SWPL clubs and the positive way in which they engaged with our discussions.”The proposals outlined by Campbell are not hugely dferent from those presented by her SPFL counterpart Neil Doncaster in the week before Christmas. Both are offering a subsidiary model which would include a dedicated board and extra administrative and commercial personnel.In these circumstances it will come down to which organisation the clubs best trust to deliver the substantial extra income they need to sustain professional football. A cynic might suggest that neither the SPFL nor the SWF has an impressive track record when it comes to securing wholesome and lucrative sponsorship deals.In an ideal world, and for all their faults, the Scottish FA would take over the running of the SWPL, using their commercial muscle to create an environment as close as financially possible to the one in England. Given the organisations appalling treatment of womens football throughout the last century its the least they could do, but – in true Scottish football fashion – the obvious solution is not on the table.THE other issue arising from the governance talks is a growing disconnect between the SWPL  clubs and their second tier counterparts. It continues what has been an unfortunate season for the SWPL  clubs.Their numbers were reduced from eight to seven when Forfar Farmington withdrew from SWPL competitions shortly after the start of the League Cup. Rather than leave SWPL  with nine clubs, Partick Thistle were promoted up to the top ision.Doncasters presentation on behalf of the SPFL last month was to SWPL  clubs only, and, although SWF opted for a more inclusive approach on Friday, it appears that the top ision clubs alone will decide where their future lies. At the time of writing this weeks meeting involves only the top ten.There had also, I believe, been discussions about expanding SWPL  to twelve teams next season should the SPFL model be preferred. While not completely off the table, there may have been a cooling-off towards that suggestion.SO,the ten SWPL  clubs do decide to map out their own future, are they likely to favour SWF or the SPFL From soundings, five are already pretty much in the SPFL camp. They are, in order of current league position, Rangers, Celtic, Motherwell, Hearts and Hamilton Accies.Two others – Glasgow City and Partick Thistle – are likely to favour the new SWF model. opinion, Thistles stance has nothing to do with their mens team being relegated by the SPFL in  the board will go with what they think is the best option for their womens team.The three clubs believed to be open to persuasion are Hibernian, Aberdeen and Spartans. But even they are more likely to come down in favour of the SPFL option.There is no doubt that SWF are passionate about the game they currently run, and they finally came up with concrete proposals on Friday. But it may be they will pay a heavy price for not having done so earlier, as seven of the ten clubs unsuccessfully asked for the information to be made available in October.Instead, it was the SPFL who got in front of the clubs first – and that may prove pivotal."},{"url":null,"title":"young-mungo-nicola-sturgeon-says-douglas-stuart-one-greats","story":"Scotland’s First Minister thanked the publisher for allowing her to read an advance copy of Young Mungo, which is due to be published in April.She praised the book as “exquisitely written” and said it surpasses his debut novel Shuggie Bain, which won the Booker Prize in .Publisher Pan Macmillan describes Young Mungo as “a vivid portrayal of working-class le and the deeply moving story of the dangerous first love of two young men: Mungo and James”.: Scottish LibDems: Covid Inquiry needs to be ruthless and thoroughSturgeon, renowned for her love of reading, tweeted: “So, @Doug_D_Stuart I wasn’t sure this could live up to Shuggie Bain, but it surpasses it.“Deeply harrowing but gently infused with hope  love.

A lot of the symptoms that go along with eating disorder are anxiety disorder based.”: Seven year wait for child mental health services branded torturous by Lib Dem leaderHe said there was “no doubt” that the numbers of children and young people requiring hospital treatment had risen in the past two years.“Again, we have to be careful as, thankfully, the numbers are still quite small,” he said.“But the experience is that the number of referrals to community services and leading to inpatient admissions is higher, there is no doubt about it and this is reflected in the Canadian study.”He said that while some CAMHS services were stood down during the first phase of the pandemic, eating disorders are always categorised as urgent, so there should not have been any treatment delays for those most at risk.“At no time has anybody in Lanarkshire who was referred with an eating disorder not been given an assessment and an intervention plan. “What I do think is that during the first wave all of our referrals fell off a clf when we went into March to June and I think people weren’t seeking help -it wasn’t necessarily an access issue. “The nature of the condition means it’s secretive and young people hide it so the social isolation, not being in at school, disrupted meal times - all those kinds of things. “Young people may have been able to hide it and combined with starving themselves harder and exercising more than in previous times means that when it did become apparent - psychology and physically they were in a worse condition.”The NSPCC said there was a % rise in contacts from children across the UK to Childline about eating disorders and body image in -.Adeniyi Alade, head of NSPCC Scotland, said: “Some experienced unhealthy eating behaviours for the first time, while others suffered relapses or worsened symptoms. : Signs of Omicrom in children - Full list by GPs“Our Childline counsellors heard children’s fears of putting on weight and about a disruption to routines and organised activities that previously helped maintain a sense of control over eating and body image and give a confidence boost. “Some also shared concerns about reduced access to support services, such as eating disorder clinics, therapists and social workers.”Estimates suggest up to . million people in the UK have an eating disorder and growing numbers male. Dedicated charity Beat says Scotland does not collect data on referrals “so we have no idea what the prevalence is in Scotland.”It takes an average of three and a half years for someone to get treatment after their symptoms first emerge. The longest delay, for both children and adults, is because they do not realise they are ill, according to the charity.The most common is binge eating disorder but there has also been a rise in calls about ARFID - avoidant restrictive food intake disorder, where people avoid certain foods or types of food which compromises calorie consumption.Emma Broadhurst, the charity’s National Officer for Scotland, said she agreed that the focus on exercising may have been a factor in the rise in eating disorders.She said: “During lockdown I worked on our helpline and it used to be something that I would see quite a lot that people would say ‘all I’m hearing is how much exercise I should be doing’. “You have to enforce that it’s not aimed at you - it’s okay for you to sit outside or do a small walk.“It’s been really challenging for young people, everything has gone out the window.\"They might think, ‘what is it that I can do  I can exercise, I can eat healthily, that’s what they are telling me to do and that just spirals.“The other thing is, thatyou weren’t feeling yourself, you were told that it was the pandemic and it will all be okay afterwards. “We were told not to trouble the NHS so people just sat with it. It wasn’t until afterwards that suddenly there was this rush and influx of very ill people - young people and adults.“They were much more unwell.“Anecdotally we might hear that there are  inpatient beds in a health board area and there are normally two or three people in there and suddenly they were having  or  and that has continued.”She said services were beginning to see younger children before the pandemic, “We tend to think of eating disorders as white, middle-class girl, about  or  but we are getting more and more calls about primary aged children being referred. “It could be because we are doing a very good job of raising awareness, it could be because of the pandemic.” Ms Broadhurst said it was known that children were more likely to disclose mental health issues to teachers than parents, which may also have led to delays in diagnosis and more severe presentations.The charity leader, whose own daughter is recovered from anorexia, says warning signs may be noticeable weight loss or increased awareness of the calorie content of dferent foods. Children may develop mood swings or spend more time alone to exercise excessively.She said: “My daughter was ill andsomeone had pointed all that out to me beforehand I’d have been like...’aah’...but I didn’t put all of the pieces of the jigsaw together.”For advice and support go to beateatingdisorders.org.uk or call the charity’s helpline on   "},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : amOne of the last events to take to the stage of the Orkney theatre before the pandemic began is set to make athis February, after a year#s hiatus. the Orkney district round of the Scottish Community Drama AssociationOne Act Play Festival is set to run for three nights from Wednesday, February [hellip]copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, when ministers then assert that ferry replacement costs must be met by Orkney Islands Council, but not by their counterparts on the west coast, it simply runs salt in the wounds.#Indeed, during the same question time, the transport minister boasted about a £m Scottish Government investment in port infrastructure serving one west coast route, even though it falls under the responsibility of the local council. That being the case, there is no reason why similar investment cannot be made in vessel replacement on Orkney’s leline internal ferry routes.#I welcome confirmation that discussions are ongoing between the Finance Secretary and OIC. However, there has been no lack of discussions over the years. What we need to see is agreement reached, procurement started and vessels delivered.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

An incredible moment and incredible feeling. To score in front of the South Bank is always amazing but I’ve waited a long, long time for that.“I was expecting it to be ruled out to be honest and then Raul almost took it off me when he blocked it on the line but it was an amazing feeling.“More than that, it was a fantastic result for us, and we said it was a big night for us.

I don’t want to see this guy dead.”Moments later, the feed cut out. vw,vw,px, px\"Law enforcement officials gather at a local school near the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue A Meta company spokesperson later confirmed that Facebook removed the video.Multiple people heard the hostage-taker refer to Siddiqui as his “sister” on the livestream.But John Floyd, board chairman for the Houston chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations – the nation’s largest Muslim advocacy group – said Siddiqui’s brother, Mohammad Siddiqui, was not involved.“This assailant has nothing to do with Dr Aafia, her family, or the global campaign to get justice for Dr Aafia.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia.

Speaking for a younger generation on the Springfield Road, Michael John O’Rawe said it was long past time for the barriers to be removed.“They stop me getting about after pm, that’s about the gist of it for me,” he said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJoseph Quinn gives his views from the Springfield road area in West Belfast close to the Lanark Way Peace Wall. FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueJoseph Quinn gives his views from the Springfield road area in West Belfast close to the Lanark Way Peace Wall.“From my point of view, everyone’s mixing after a night out and no one cares anymore.”That contrasted with the views of former shipyard worker Joseph Quinn, who turns  in  and has lived on the road for  of those years.Asked why he wanted them to remain, he said: “If you live here long enough you’ll know — simple as that.“It feels better with the walls there. It’s people from outside the area that cause the problems.”Read MoreMore than  peace wall barriers remain in Northern IrelandLooking back to when they first went up, he explained: “It used to be a mixed community and everybody got on, but the Troubles changed everything, it’s as simple as that. People took sides.“I served my time working in the shipyard. I could see the discrimination going on with the dferent jobs.“There were no Catholics working as foremen, that’s what I was brought up under.“That was the way it was years ago it was all about what school you go to, what’s your name.”Askedhe could imagine change, he said: “It’ll take a long, long time.“I don’t know. You read some of the papers, and some of the politicians don’t seem to want it to stop with the statements they make.”On the other side of the interface on Cupar Street, resident of  years Marie Fischer said the peaceline had just forced her to walk an extra mile to get to the hospital.“The walls have actually got higher over the years, so I don’t know when they’re ever going to bring them down. I don’t think they will either,” she said.“I do feel socially cut off as well, but I think you just get used to living with them, really.”Another, older resident, who did not want to give his name, echoed the phrase: “Not in my letime.”He said even the opening of the gates in the walls during daytime would still make him fearful of violence.Terence McMillan, a member of Clonard Residents Association, was quickly on the scene in an attempt to lower tensions after last year’s rioting.He said there remained a long-term aspiration for the walls to come down.Noting that the barrier was erected in  after Bombay Street was burned to the ground, he said: “That fear still remains and increases in times of tension, like the recent riots at Lanark Way.“During these riots, when the peaceline gate was broken down, local families were at the point of leaving their homes.“The walls can only come down when all the underlying issues are dealt with, like political tensionscontentious parades.“Local people on both sides of the wall want them to remain until these issues are dealt with and political tensions subside.”He added that without the peaceline the PSNI would simply not have had the resources to deal with last year’s trouble.Further along the interface at Northumberland Street, the New Le City Church sits on a barrier between the Falls and Shankill Roads.By day the peace wall is a tourist attraction, but its gates still close every night at .pm.It is a frustrating reality for Pastor Jack McKee.He said those attending events in the evening often have to be picked up from the Falls Road side and driven around the entire structure to get there.He told the Belfastthat negative media attention, paramilitary influence and a lack of focus and will from Stormont made any substantial change unlikely.“When the media want to do a story they’ll come to us for a comment, but usually they’re not a bit concerned about what’s going on on the ground unless it’s part of their agenda,” he said.“Honestly, that really does get under the skin of a lot of people. For example, we had a cross-community carol service right between the iding gates in no-man’s land.“They were singing Christmas carols together and read out a few comments, but the media wasn’t interested.”He added: “If you go to those gates now, you would see a pre-school play area with iding gates still behind them and security cameras overlooking them.”Pastor McKee said there was a feeling promises from Stormont on peace walls had not been fulfilled.“This is over  years on from the Good Friday Agreement,” he pointed out.“We’re still locking gates at .pm at night on main thoroughfares. We shouldn’t have to be doing that in this day and age, but that’s what’s going on.”Askedthere was a strong demand in the community for change, he said: “I don’t think it’s the kind of thing people are running around every day thinking about.“But it’s whenever they are highlighted, that’s when people start to express their opinions.“The signicant majority of people within our communities want the walls removed completely.“But also the majority would not think the time was right for it to happen.“The big question is when will that time ever be right, and what steps can be taken to bring us closer ”Hoping to answer that question is Seamus Corr, of the Black Mountain Shared Space project.The group has secured over £m in funding to start construction this year on a new shared community facility on the site of a former tin factory between Springfield Park, Ballygomartin and Springmartin.Vacated in the early s, he said the site became a focal point for young people being drawn into nightly attacks on each other.The group runs good relations programmes and has removed, softened or re-imaged six barriers in the area out of the original .He argued that looking towards a date for bringing down all peace walls was not helpful, and progress should be measured instead by steps like trust building and economic investment.Mr Corr said he would approach the issue of peace walls “completely dferently” from Stormont.“Communities have been historically under-resourced, have seen no sort of financial incentive from the peace process, and so it doesn’t make sense to tell them: ‘It’s time for that wall to come down’.”Asked about why many residents still wanted to keep them, he said: “There’s one clear thing — the closer you are to it the more of a security blanket it is.“The more you come away from it, then there’s less of the ‘never in my letime’ attitude.“But I understand that. The clear thing is that there is more people talking to each other, there’s more people engaging with each other.“We’re in a better place than we’ve been in a long, long time. But a lot of things are beyond our control.“Brexit, the protocol and either of the agendas that play out, whether they’re green or orange.“That has an impact on young people being coerced and being led up the wrong path to agitate. It’s the same on both sides.“There is a serious amount of good work being done — but it’s going to take time, and building trust is massive.”Most ReadTwo for the price of one: Cottage included in sale of beautully designed Downpatrick homeUDR man attended ‘sensitive briefings’ despite police linking him to loyalist gangRioter ‘mistook’ petrol bombs for a bag of booze after drinking  cans of lagerMajority of NI parties slam move to allow MPs to sit in Stormont as MLAsJudge condemns man who pulled over car while impersonating police officer on NI motorwayTop VideosPlayCCTV: Child flees for safety as man steals car in BelfastPlayPark Run participants observe a silence in memory of murdered Ashling Murphy \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ee .ece AUTOCROP wh afefbbffccefcc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ee .ece AUTOCROP wh afefbbffccefcc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Firefighters battle eleventh floor fire at Europa HotelLatest Northern IrelandUDA godfathers were named to cops by loyalist killer BlairSurvivors of human trafficking flourishing with NI charitySon of Brian Black opens up about tragic harbour accident: ‘It was so hard parting with dad’s beloved boat’Lyra gun accused to face third chargeVigils held for Ashling Murphy as murder investigation continuesLatestFormer Israeli PM Netanyahu ‘negotiating plea deal in corruption case’Conor Coady describes ‘incredible moment’ after ending his long Molineux droughtGardaí closing in on Ashling Murphy’s killer with a new chief suspectMark Wood heroics and a solid opening partnership give England Ashes hopeKevin De Bruyne urges Manchester City to keep going despite big lead at the top,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Peter MorrisonStaff reporterJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailFour of the five Executive parties have reacted angrily at news that MPs will be able to double job as MLAs because of the temporaryof dual mandates - a move that could benefit the DUP.The UUP, Alliance, Sinn Fein and SDLP united in opposition at what they described as a “regressive” step.Under the plan, MPs elected to the Assembly in May can keep their Westminster seats. The arrangement will remain in place until the next Westminster election, due by December  at the latest.Details of the plan emerged in a letter from the government peer Lord Caine to fellow lords on Friday, and were revealed by the BBC.Lord Caine, the under secretary of state for Northern Ireland, said it was aimed at providing stability as local parties reconfigure their representation.But the revelation drew an angry reaction from parties opposed to dual mandates.Some suggested it would solve a tricky issue for the DUP, allowing leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson toto Stormont while avoiding a potentially dficult parliamentary by-election for the party in Lagan Valley, where Alliance had been confident of making a serious challenge.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie accused the Northern Ireland Office of “directly supporting the DUP election campaign”.TUV leader Jim Allister claimed it was a “shameless fix”.Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill called it blatant and disgraceful interference”, while the SDLP and Alliance said their three MPs will vote against the mandate when comes to the House of Commons.Alliance leader Naomi Long, who quit Belfast City Council and the Assembly after being elected as East Belfast MP in , said it was “a seriously retrograde step”.Previously, some MLAs were able to hold dual mandates as councillors and MPs, or members of the House of Lords.Legislation preventing MPs from holding seats at Westminster and Stormont was passed in .It came into effect in  when some MPs were forced to give up their seats in the Assembly. Some parties had already stopped the practice.Theof dual mandates until the next general election would bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK. For example, the current Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross sits as both an MP and a Member of the Scottish Parliament .Lord Caine’s letter states that, as was previously the case, someone holding office as both MP and an MLA will not be able to claim their Assembly salary, currently £,. An MP’s salary is currently £,.His letter, reported by the BBC, states: There is no appetite or consensus in Northern Ireland to allow dual mandates to continue indefinitely or toto a situation in which the overwhelming majority of MPs from Northern Ireland were also members of the Assembly.”Lord Caine said the objective was to support further the ing of the devolved institutions by providing stability where Northern Ireland parties need to reconfigure their representation across Parliament and Stormont without the triggering of parliamentary by-elections.”But some local parties claim they were blindsided by the move.Mrs Long, the Alliance leader, said: “I staked my own political future on ending double jobbing in , when I left council and the Assembly to focus on representing my constituents in Westminster.“I was successful in getting double jobbing banned. This is a seriously retrograde step.“Other parties promised to act but only did when forced by legislation in .“I#ve been both an MP and an MLA: you cannot properly do both jobs in the long term.“The ban was subject to extensive consultation: this reversal has not been.”North Down Alliance MP Stephen Farry also signalled his opposition.He added: “There has been no consultation with the NI parties and public on this regressive turning back the clock on dual mandates double-jobbing.”Mr Beattie, the UUP leader, tweeted: The fact NIO now directly supporting DUP election campaign means they are not a neutral department.Former UUP leader Steve Aiken said it was “beyond belief”, asking how anyone could think it would do anything to restore confidence in democracy.Claire Hanna, who was elected as SDLP South Belfast MP in , tweeted: Being an MP is a full time job, and then some, as is being an MLA. People deserve representation at both levels, and dual mandates were abolished for good reason. NIOshould not be facilitating DUP threats and gambling with devolution.Mr Allister, the TUV leader, added: “Is this the last throw of the dice, a desperate attempt by the DUP to reverse their nosee in the polls “If so, I suspect they will be in for a rude awakening. Dual mandates were abolished for good reason. The public demanded a policy of one man woman, one job. They are unlikely to be impressed at this policy being reversed.“The only thing which has changed since the abolition of duel mandates is the desperation of the DUP.An NIO spokesperson said: On Wednesday, the government tabled an amendment to the NIBill.This followed a proposal by Lib Dem peer and former leader of the Alliance Party in Northern Ireland, Lord Alderdice during Committee Stage in the House of Lords, which could have allowed dual mandates to have been allowed indefinitely. This was not opposed by his front bench.The government#s proposal is for any dual mandates to be strictly time limited to the subsequent Westminster election. It will enable the smoother transition between legislatures should an MP wish to take a seat in the NI Assembly, and therefore supports the objectives of the bill in promoting greater stability.It will be subject to the usual parliamentary scrutiny as the Bill progresses.Most ReadTwo for the price of one: Cottage included in sale of beautully designed Downpatrick homeUDR man attended ‘sensitive briefings’ despite police linking him to loyalist gangRioter ‘mistook’ petrol bombs for a bag of booze after drinking  cans of lagerMajority of NI parties slam move to allow MPs to sit in Stormont as MLAsJudge condemns man who pulled over car while impersonating police officer on NI motorwayTop VideosPlayCCTV: Child flees for safety as man steals car in BelfastPlayPark Run participants observe a silence in memory of murdered Ashling Murphy \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ee .ece AUTOCROP wh afefbbffccefcc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ee .ece AUTOCROP wh afefbbffccefcc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Firefighters battle eleventh floor fire at Europa HotelLatest PoliticsNorthern Ireland peace walls: ‘The closer you live to one, the more of a security blanket it is’MP vents anger over Troubles legacy ‘farce’Questions raised after Justice Department s £m to Finance Department as PSNI faces budget shortfallBaroness Hoey and Jamie Bryson defend their comments on nationalist ‘domination’Alliance councillor Michelle Kelly ‘sickened’ by Boris Johnson’s party after she suffered traumatic lockdown birthLatestGardaí closing in on Ashling Murphy’s killer with a new chief suspectMark Wood heroics and a solid opening partnership give England Ashes hopeKevin De Bruyne urges Manchester City to keep going despite big lead at the topHundreds more trains axed over staff shortagesFormer quarterback married to singer Sara Evans charged with domestic violence,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

signed as early as this week, could usher Netanyahu off the Israeli political stage for years, paving the way for a leadership race in his Likud party and shaking up Israel’s political map.Any deal would also absolve Netanyahu of an embarrassing and protracted trial that has gripped the nation and risks tarnishing his legacy.A spokesman for Netanyahu declined to

inclusion of the charge of “moral turpitude”, which under Israeli law would ban Netanyahu from politics for seven years.They were also deliberating whether Netanyahu would be forced to do community service under the deal.Including “moral turpitude” would challenge Netanyahu’s vows toto lead the country after his -year reign was ended last year by a coalition of ideologically disparate parties

Strangford Lough is a vital stopping off point as thousands comes to feed on its shores at low tide. Itrsquos an annual audio and visual spectacle that wildfowl expert Kerry Mackie never misses.As the woodlands burst into colour, songwriter Brigid OrsquoNeill draws inspiration before performing a secret gig at a small converted church on the shores of the lough.On a farm to the south tip of the lough, RSPB ranger Mark McCormick looks for endangered species like the yellowhammer. He explains how his work has helped him overcome PTSD which he suffered after witnessing a terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge in London.Around boats are being removed from the water and repaired, in Portaferry former ferry captain -year-old John Murray is getting his boat, the St Brendan, on to the quay for the winter, with the help of four generations of the Murray family.In the second episode, as winter approaches Hugh Thurgate is moving livestock between islands and Katy Bell from Ulster Wildle checks barn owl boxes at Mount Stewart. Bad weather is coming and preparations need to be made.As winter storms howl, Kenny Smyth makes sure the boats in his boatyard are secure, before retreating to his shed to work on Laragh, his beautul wooden River yacht. Working on the boat reminds Kenny of his father who established the yard after the war.Rough winter weather also gives Heidi McIlvenny a chance to search for shark egg cases, known by some as mermaidsrsquo purses. Strangford Lough provides habitat for sharks and rays and Heidirsquos work provides important research.At her farm near Greyabbey Kerry Angus looks forward to lambing and reflects how the care she provides for her flock is consistent with providing meat for the farm shop. Close by, Kerry Mackie is setting up traps for tagging oyster catchers.At Port Loughan farm, Katy is installing barn owl nesting boxes before the spring nesting season. Itrsquos been a long winter, but installing the boxes is a real sign that spring is on its way.In the third episode spring has sprung and there is new wildle arriving at the lough. As boat owners prepare for summer, Kieron Black says an emotional goodbye to Pavane, the boat owned by his late father, Brian Black, the environmental broadcaster and journalist who died in a tragic accident in Strangford harbour in .The fourth and final episode is set in summer, a busy season as humans and birds flock to the lough to enjoy its un-spoilt beauty and unique habitats.At Slievemoyle farm Mark McCormick from the RSPB is camping out for a dawn chorus survey. He is hoping he will hear the distinctive call of the endangered yellowhammer.Summers on Strangford lough mean long evenings stretching into glorious sunsets. In Portaferry four generations of the Murray family take the St Brendan out for an evening of fishing.Summer is regatta season on the Lough and a big moment for Kenny Smyth and his River class yacht. Itrsquos  years since the Rivers were built, and Kenny is hoping to wrestle a race trophy from his brother, Graham.Away from the buzz of summer activities, Katy Bell is hoping to find healthy barn owl chicks. Wet and extremely hot weather has meant most of the sites have failed this year, but a new site may have some healthy chicks.Out on the lough Kerry Mackie is counting greylag geese. Itrsquos important to monitor the populations as they can cause problems for farmers. Carrying out the counts reminds him of his deep family connections to the lough and a letime of memories.Kieron Black is also out snorkelling, remembering his father Brian. He would always try to fill everyday with experiences, something Kieron also tries to do, as he loses himself in the otherworldly surroundings of the loughrsquos seabed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Celtic Bhoys kick off new year with win  ","story":"CELTIC Bhoys kicked off the new calendar year by picking up all three points away to long time league rivals Newcastle Swts at a soaking wet Donard Park on Saturday afternoon.An early Shaun Megahey penalty gave The Hoops a lead they would never relinquish before captain Michael Rice and marksman Jay Gibney ensured there would be no late rally from the Seasiders.Newcastle will count themselves unlucky to concede a penalty kick just five minutes in for a handball that they disputed actually came off a green and white jersey.Nonetheless, Celticrsquos ever reliable defender, Shaun Megahey, made no mistake with the spot kick and sent goalkeeper Fintan Canavan the wrong way to open the scoring.The Hoops kept their foot on the pedal with striker Jay Gibney testing Canavan from range. Newcastle did not make things easy for the visitors and constantly remained a threat in attack with the experienced Neil Corr causing problems all afternoon.Celticrsquos Conaill Kerr had his headed goal chalked off after he was adjudged to have fouled custodian Canavan by referee Peter Kelly.Kerr was determined not to be deterred by this and went on a surging run in the next passage of play, dancing around the Newcastle defence to unleash a shot that just whisked wide of the post.This seemed to wake up the Seasiders, who forced Celtic to retreat into their own half largely in thanks to the midfield display of Peter Brannigan.Newcastle nearly had their momentum derailed when lsquokeeper Canavan misplaced a pass to the feet of Gibney, although the Celtic strikerrsquos snapshot landed safely back into the arms of the grateful number one.As the hosts went back on the attack, Richard McInerney combined well with Shane Kearney before the Newcastle number rsquos inviting cross into the box was punched to safety by Celtic lsquokeeper Nathan Curran.The following ten minutes of play consisted of both teams battling for possession in the middle of the park, where man of the match Corey McCartan was notably winning the lionrsquos share for his Celtic side.The Hoops almost doubled their lead when Jordan McCoubrey fired a cross into the Newcastle box where team-mate Gibney managed to poke his head in front of Canavan to round the lsquokeeper.However, with the angle at goal not in his favour, the Celtic number nine saw his effort sail across the line and eventually out for a throw-in. This signalled the last notable passage of play before the half-time interval.Celtic began the restart positively with the ball quickly making its way back to lsquokeeper Curran, who sent a cross field pass to the feet of Stephen Galbraith.The Hoopsrsquo midfielder played a cute first time pass to Gibney, who sumptuously back-heeled to team-mate McCoubrey for a shot on goal that resulted in a corner.Newcastle decided to fight fire with fire and went on the attack. In what was possibly another sign that it wasnrsquot to be their day, the hosts had appeals for a penalty waved off after Brannigan was met with a tackle that sent him to the floor inside the box.The Seasiders enjoyed a purple patch where they hit the visitors with wave after wave of attacks, although they couldnrsquot find the vital touch to put the ball in the net.Celtic lsquokeeper Curran was forced to clear his lines on multiple occasions, and to his credit, The Hoopsrsquo number one remained sharp and focused throughout the  minutes.Peter OrsquoHare and skipper Louis Brunsdon were pulling the strings for Newcastle, but their final ball was just off the mark in what was becoming an increasingly frustrating afternoon for the home side.As the playing conditions began to become increasingly worse, there was a bright light in Celtic youngster Eoin Kelly, who made an impactful appearance off the bench and slowly began to swing the momentum in favour of his side ndash largely also in thanks to team-mate McCartan overturning possession in midfield.Another Celtic substitute, Sean McMahon, forced Newcastle lsquokeeper Canavan to produce the save of the match after his left footed effort was erted outside the post by a spectacular acrobatic e.The resultant corner was met with a similarly impressive save from Canavan, who stopped a point blank flick on header from Kelly.Newcastlersquos purple patch had well and truly ended and this was signied further when Celtic doubled their lead through skipper Michael Rice.After a long ball into the box looped over the Seasidersrsquo defence, the ball rolled invitingly out for Rice to toe poke beyond the impressive Canavan with  minutes left on the clock.The home outfit were not one to give up and went in search of the goal that would set up a nervous last few moments for their opponents.Corr almost awarded his side this opportunity when the ball landed at the veteranrsquos feet with only Curran to beat.However, the stubborn Celtic custodian refused to be bettered and spread his six foot frame as wide as he could to narrow the target and deny the certain goal.Moments later, Celticrsquos Peter Casey was clattered in the middle of the park but referee Kelly waved on the advantage which turned out to be an important call.Megahey gathered the loose ball on the right hand side of the pitch, before squaring a pass to Gibney, who struck a curling effort into the top right corner of the net to round off the scoring.Resilient to the end, Newcastle launched one last attack in search of a consolation goal.Despite the ball hitting the Celtic post in the midst of a goalmouth scramble, Newcastle captain Brunsdon couldnrsquot supply the required rebound and the referee blew his whistle for the final time.After the contest, man of the match Corey McCartan gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance and winning start to the year.ldquoAll of the boys worked hard, especially coming back from a few weeks off after Christmas, he said.ldquoIt was a hard game and everyone was still stf, so I think it was physically tough for both teams and the weather definitely didnrsquot help.ldquoNewcastle surprised me because of how sharp they were and how high of a level their fitness was, but we got the job done and are now focused on the next game.Newcastle: F Canavan, C Scott, S Kelly, D Allister, J Maginn, P Brannigan, P OrsquoHare, L Brunsdon , R McInerney, N Corr, S Kearney.Subs: D Rooney, C McMahon, C Morrison.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, B Connolly, M Rice , C McCartan, S Galbraith, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: R Fitzpatrick, E Kelly, S McMahon.Referee: Peter Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_IrishStreet.jpg","title":"Downpatrick regeneration ‘offers some light’ for year  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has warned that  could be a dficult year for the economy.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he fears there could be job losses in the retail sector and has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it can to provide support.He said the council should consult with the business community and also consider some form of rate relief.He said the economic situation had been exacerbated by the pandemic and urged the public to adhere to Covid regulations.ldquoThe virus has no respect for age or gender. We must abide by the rules in order we can bring the pandemic to an end as quickly as possible. There is no other way and we have to remain as safe as possible, he remarked.ldquoI fully appreciate the damage which the pandemic has done to the local economy and I fear that there could be job losses in .ldquoThe business community in Downpatrick and surrounding towns and villages needs help. Many business are struggling and will continue to struggle unless they are given support.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council has a big role to play and should be doing all it can.ldquoThe council must examine all means at its disposal and also seek funding from the Stormont Executive. There is no time to waste and no stone should left unturned.Cllr Curran said one bright spot was the plans for the regeneration of Downpatrick.He looked forward to the completion of a pound, scheme to upgrade Church Street and called for the implementation of the much larger scheme for the redevelopment of the former police station site in Irish Street.ldquoWhile things may appear bleak, the regeneration of Downpatrick offers some light, he said.ldquoWe must also look at ways of providing support for our other towns and villages, including Ardglass where there are plans to carry out major improvements to the harbour.Cllr Curran added: ldquoWe are going through a period such as which we have have never experienced before.

Coastguards around the country are marking the th anniversary of the service dedicated to saving lives at sea. To mark the milestone,  throwlines - part of the standard lesaving kit - will be cast by coastguards around the country as a symbol of the services dedication“We have got a lot safer and our rescue capabilityand we are into technical rescue now.“We rely a lot more on technology as far as our communications are concerned, and the new technologies, as far as drones to assist in search and rescue and other unmanned vehicles , will be key moving forward.”Adding that volunteers and staff remain the most important element of the Coastguard, Mr Wright said: “We couldn’t do what we do without the volunteers who give up their time    days a year. Without that workforce we wouldn’t be able to undertake the search and rescue that we do.”Maritime minister Robert Courts said: “Congratulations HM Coastguard on their -year anniversary. I am immensely proud and humbled by the continued dedication and professionalism from the staff and volunteers which ensures everyone’s safety on our shores and around our coast.A Coastguard helicopter assists with an operation over Ballintoy“HM Coastguard is the backbone of our maritime sector and the nation is indebted to its incredible workforce which continues to deliver an exceptional service.”Claire Hughes, Coastguard director, said: “When you look at how we started and where we are now, it’s easy to celebrate the innovation and development that can be seen throughout the service.“And yet we are far more proud of the people, the volunteers and the staff who, throughout two centuries, have continued to strive to keep people safe at the coast and out at sea.“We always have and always will respond to those in distress.“While this milestone is an opportunity for us to look back with pride on what we’ve achieved, we have always looked to the future, and I’m proud that we continue to look for ways in which to improve and save lives.“I’m proud of the commitment, the dedication and selfless sacrice, and I’m proud of how the service has developed and continues to do so.”A Coastguard spokeswoman said innovation continues within the service, including a £ million upgrade to its national radio network and the introduction of electric vehicles to reduce its carbon footprint.She said: “With technology ever evolving, the service will continue to strive to be at the forefront of innovation to carry out its le-saving work.“The service continues to adapt to changes – in the last few years providing mutual aid and support during events and incidents to other emergency partners.“During the pandemic, coastguards supported the NHS, attended the G and COP in , and are called in to support during national emergencies including flooding or supplying water to stranded drivers.”Robert CourtsNHSCOP  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularTeebane anniversary: eight men slaughtered on way home from workBen Lowry: Double jobbing change seems to be bid by London to shore up the DUPFootballer apologises for ‘teenage bravado’ tweet about shooting OrangemenVaccine passports could be scrappedother parties back DUP policy as restrictions come in for review at next week’s Executive meeting, says First Minister Paul GivanVIDEO: Move to rename Prince Andrew Way – one of four such roads in Northern Ireland – as mother shreds his royal statusMost PopularBest SAD lamps: How a sun lamp can help you through winter, and the best from Amazon, Beurer and LumieDyson Airwrap: best alternative hair styling tools, and when will the Dyson Airwrap be back in stock How to stay warm without using central heating - including blankets, hot water bottles and teddy beddingLumie Sunrise Alarm review: how does it work, does it help with SAD, and is it any good                        This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

His ‘hardline’ opponents attacked him for failing to stand up to pressure from the Labour government at Westminster for ‘civil rights’ reforms. Two months later he resigned. Under pressure from Westminster, the reforms went ahead.As we approach the May  election, unionism again stands at a crossroads. Within the past year, both main unionist parties have replaced their leaders. They face immense challenges. Like O’Neill, they are squeezed between the expectations of their electorate and the demands of a national government pursuing broader priorities. Although they favour devolution, they cannot credibly argue that the  Agreement has delivered good stable governance. The Assembly has operated for only  of its  years, its ministers do not trust each other, and many voters question its value.The Assembly fails the most basic test for any democracy: there is no effective opposition. Simply by winning enough seats, the five largest parties carve up the spoils. DUP and Sinn Féin ministers stand accused of financial scandal, most obviously over the RHI affair, but the two dominant parties ‘oversee’ their own conduct through the Assembly committee system.Despite the lack of opposition, the Executive is highly unstable. Sinn Féin have shown that Semtex and Armalites are no longer needed to bring down Stormont: merely by threatening to withdraw, they wield a permanent veto over all policy decisions.If as the polls suggest they become the largest party after the election, they will select the First Minister. They would present this as another milestone in unionism’s retreat. Although first and deputy ministers have the same powers, both main unionist parties will likely use the threat of this outcome to persuade voters to vote for them.In this challenging context, unionism has to choose between two broad paths: to keep muddling on with a system which is clearly broken, or to grip the problem resolutely, demand changes in the Agreement, and make Stormont work well for most voters, irrespective of their community background.There are obvious advantages for the British and Irish governments and the Executive parties in doing nothing: nobody will be blamed and no sinecures will be lost. In time, however, events will likely force the pace of reform. It may soon suit Sinn Féin to collapse the Executive again or the election results may call into question the whole sectarian apparatus of community designation, cross-community voting and mandatory coalition.The Agreement requires key decisions in the Assembly — including the selection of first ministers — to be taken on a cross-community basis. This may have seemed sensible in , when it was widely accepted that the republican insurgency was best managed as a conflict between two national identity communitiesin a deeply ided society. But it is no longer appropriate.The electorate has evolved beyond these binary designations. In , % of respondents to the Le and Times Survey described themselves as ‘unionist’, % ‘nationalist’ and % ‘neither’. In , the corresponding figures were %, % and %. With a “neither” plurality, the argument goes, shouldn’t we have a ‘neither’ first minister The coming election might bring matters to a head. If most MLAs designate as ‘other’, rather than unionist or nationalist — mirroring their constituents — they would have a strong case for changing the rules. Otherwise the system would privilege single-community parties over those who prioritise reconciliation, which the Agreement ostentatiously encourages.The main ‘neither’ party — Alliance — is already committed to replacing community designation with a system of weighted majorities for defined votes and to forming coalitions voluntarily by negotiation after each election. So is the TUV, commonly misrepresented as the most ‘hardline’ unionist party. The leaders of the other two unionist parties have also indicated that they want eventually to move to a system of voluntary coalitions with an effective opposition. The strongest resistance comes from Sinn Féin, which claims that the proposed change would lead to its exclusion from government. It clearly doesn’t have much confidence in its ability to attract a coalition partner.Unionists might not immediately benefit: initially, such a reform would probably increase the influence of Alliance as a potential partner for parties from both traditions, as in Belfast City Council. But there is a broader pro-Union argument to be made: that the de-tribalisation of politics is an essential step in constructing the sort of inclusive Northern Ireland which will deliver lasting good government for most people here for the foreseeable future.Although a serious review of the Strand One institutions may be some time coming, unionists should prepare themselves to initiate it when the time is ripe, know what they want, and have a strategy for getting it. They should commit themselves to a Union based on equal citizenship and respect for ersity, in contrast to the ethnic singularity of Irish nationalism.Their message to the electorate should be that having celebrated its centenary, Northern Ireland has grown beyond the tribal politics of the nineteenth-century.Three more points. Firstly, as a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, the UK government recognises that everyone in the UK has the right to fair and consistent arrangements for law enforcement, free from political interference. This right was degraded for everyone in Northern Ireland by the concessions which Tony Blair gave the IRA during secret ‘peace process’ negotiations between  and .Such flagrant defiance of the essential principles of ethical government must not be permitted in future. The leaders of unionism must insist on equal citizenship within a consistent legal framework. Everyone in Northern Ireland has the right to be treated as full and equal citizens of the UK. This vital principle is degraded when the British government undermines the rule of law, treats Northern Ireland like a colony, fails to protect its borders or dilutes its constitutional status.Secondly, an immediate and challenging priority is to reverse the damage being done by the Northern Ireland Protocol, rashly and unnecessarily conceded by the UK government as the price of Brexit for the rest of the nation. Whatever their designation, Northern Ireland consumers are already having to pay higher prices for a more limited range of goods.The EU’s punitive control regime is impeding free trade between Britain and Northern Ireland, deliberately erting Northern Ireland’s trading relationships away from Britain, and subjecting Northern Ireland to a swathe of EU regulations over which its people have no say. In signing up for the Protocol, the British government has shockingly acknowledged that it has “subjugated” the Act of Union  — the constitutional basis for the Union – in response to wholly unreasonable demands from the EU.Finally, an overarching task for the leaders of unionism must be at every opportunity to challenge the  narratives of Irish nationalism: the illusion that the partition of Ireland was an historic injustice and the myth that from  to  unionists were uniquely sectarian in their treatment of their nationalist neighbours.Effective leaders must not just manage political problems but also celebrate the qualities of their people. One of the current priorities for Unionist leaders is to restore the reputation of a largely honourable community wickedly slandered.• Dr William Beattie Smith is a former civil servant and author of ‘The British State and the Northern Ireland Crisis -,’ published by the US Institute of Peace• Taken from ‘The Idea of the Union: Great Britain and Northern Ireland’ edited by John Wilson Foster  William Beattie Smith.

It is very likely, but not even certain, that it will hold two, given the large number of well-known candidates now in Lagan Valley, and the sharp rise in the votes of most of the DUP’s rival parties.Yet it still seems possible, despite at times conflicting signals from the party, that Sir Jeffrey, Edwin Poots and Paul Givan will all be standing there, in which case there is a very strong chance one of them would fail to get elected in the now five member constituency.The BBC says that details of the plan to allow MPs such as Sir Jeffrey to hold on as MPs after entering the assembly were outlined in a letter from the government peer Lord Caine to fellow lords.Jonathan Caine is little known among the public but was for a long time a very influential Northern Ireland Office advisor.Critics of the NIO’s institutional weakness in the face of a partisan pro nationalist Irish Department of Foreign Affairs, of whom I have been one, were struck by Lord Caine’s recent appointment as a junior NIO minister.It seemed that for once London was putting in place a minister who had understanding of some of the cultural problems within the NIO and that it was perhaps a welcome retreat from the UK tendency to install NI ministers who are, at least in tone, neutral on the constitutional ide here.The appointment of Conor Burns as a minister who openly expresses his unionism was similarly signicant.But some unionists will be alarmed by this new development on double jobbing.The TUV leader Jim Allister QC MLA said in a statement late last evening:“Tonight’s news that MPs will be permitted to contest the Assembly election while retaining their Westminster seats is a shameless fix. Is this the last throw of the dice, a desperate attempt by the DUP to reverse their nosee in the polls ”He added: “If so, I suspect they will be in for a rude awakening. Dual mandates were abolished for good reason. The public demanded a policy of one man   woman one job. They are unlikely to be impressed at this policy being reversed.“The only thing which has changed since the abolition of duel mandates is the desperation of the DUP. What price have they paid for this  Is this why they toned down their Protocol opposition ”This last point is the most important one. The DUP has got defensive recently when it has been criticised, above all by Mr Allister, for seeming in recent weeks to have tone down its rhetoric about the NI Protocol.Gregory Campbell wrote a long letter to this newspaper during the week , attacking the TUV leader for his persistent warnings about the DUP weakening its position.So has there been an understanding between the DUP and the Tories  Or is this a sweetener given to the unionist party without any assurance in .As it happens, I have for years argued that the double jobbing ban was doing nothing to help politics here . The ban on being a councillor and an MLA or MP is particularly stupid — it means that councillors, who have to have a full-time income to live, can hold any external job at all, from being a farmer to a surgeon to a bus driver, but cannot hold the most relevant jobs of all, that of full-time elected political office.I think you should be able to be a member of all three — council, Stormont and Westminster —you can persuade voters to vote for you but you should only then get one salary, whichever is the highest.However, this development,accurately reported, seems like a cynical way of amending a flawed policy.• Ben Lowryis News Letter editor.

The film, written and directed by Branagh sees himto his roots in the city of his early childhood. In ‘Branagh: Bringing Belfast Home’, he talks atto Kathy Clugston about his new film – what drove him to write it, working with the actors and even his refusal to water down the Belfast accent for international distribution. He also discusses his own childhood experiences of being caught up in rioting as both bystander and participant, his parents’ zest for le and how leaving the city left a deep mark on him. This is combined with footage from the film ‘Belfast’. The programme also features footage from red carpet events in both London and Belfast in which viewers will see the impact ‘Belfast’ is having on the film world.

Her husband added: “She was very mannerly, she spoke to everybody, she knew everybody’s name.”In , BBC Newsnight’s policy editor Chris Cook described Ms Gray as “the most powerful civil servant you’ve never heard of” and “also perhaps the most secretive you could ever hope to meet”.Almost four years ago her appointment as permanent secretary of Stormont’s Department of Finance drew attention. She applied for the role of head of the civil service in NI but later said she may have been rejected for the top job because it was thought she was “too much of a challenger”. She is now Boris Johnson’s principal adviser on the union.Sue Gray, a powerful civil servant who is investigating the drinks party at Downing Street during lockdown, ran a pub in this premises just outside Newry in the s with her husband.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThey set off along Highwalls Road in dry humid conditions to the Dinas Powys golf course, where a number of golfers were out enjoying the peace and quiet of the early morning before a short climb led them to the One o’Clock gate. Here the leader paused to explain that small leaved lime trees can be found in the adjacent wood, which denotes ancient woodland and also that this particular species of tree has never been found further southwest than Monmouth.Entering Park Wood the path between bare trees and over fallen autumnal leaves led them slightly uphill beside Beauville Wood for a circumnavigation of the pretty woodland to a site overlooking Michaelston. Once a pathway on the north eastern side of the wood led up to a summerhouse belonging to Cwrt yr Ala from where they would have enjoyed lovely views over their vast estate land.Exiting through a gateway there was a chance to examine a piece of rock containing crinoids which are marine animals and ancient fossils that predate dinosaurs by  million years and they are classed as plants not animals.A descent on a slippery and rocky track led them to a viewpoint complete with a wooden seat overlooking Cwrt yr Ala House away in the valley. Robert Rous owned Cwrt yr Ala in  and made many improvements to it and it remained within the family until the death of Georgina Anne Rous in . It then passed to Frances William George Gore, a nephew of the last male heir who preferred to remain in London, so he rented out the house to the renowned Cardf brewer W. H. Brain.Prior to  Mr Gore had tried to sell Cwrt yr Ala and the estate lands to Dr Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peatewho was looking for a suitable place for the newly proposed Welsh Folk Museum to be sited. In fact Peate was later offered land at St Fagans by the Earl of Plymouth for free as the site and became its first curator from  to . During World War Two he was temporarily dismissed for being a pacist and a conscientious objector, but soon reinstated..removeRecent heavy rainfall had made the normal descent via the bridleway a bit like a slalom so instead they followed tracks through the lower part of the wood to join a farm track at the top end of the steep-sided and wooded Cwm George.A rough farm track brought them to the stone bridge over the fast flowing Cadoxton River and out onto Cwrt-yr-Ala Road for the short journey into Michaelston-le-Pit where they made their way to St Michael and All Angels, to view the ‘sporting side’ of the churchyard where the Brain and Merrett families are buried before partaking of refreshments.William Henry Brainwas an English first-class cricketer and footballer who was noted for being the only man to perform the ‘wicket keeper’s hat trick’ of three dismissals off consecutive deliveries and also John Patrick Brain, a Welsh cricketer and wicketkeeper. Sir Herbert Henry Merrett who owned Cwrt yr Ala was a footballer and referee and chaired both Cardf City Football Club and was president of the Glamorgan County Cricket Club despite being a busy industrialist and Chairman of Powell Dyffryn Ltd. Another gravestone celebrated the Reverend Henry Holmes Stewart, a Scottish clergyman who was a member of the Wanderers team that won the FA Cup in  which was the same year he was ordained as a priest.Then making their way through riverside meadows and across a wooden footbridge, the surrounding trees were bearing pretty yellow catkins as they climbed uphill, then down to re-cross the river into the muddy Millfields and make their way back across the golf course to their start.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We want the assailant to know that his actions are wicked and directly undermine those of us who are seeking justice for Dr Aafia,” said Mr Floyd, who is also legal counsel for Mohammad Siddiqui.“We have confirmed that the family member being wrongly accused of this heinous act is not near the DFWarea.”Texas resident Victoria Francis told the Associated Press that she watched about an hour of the livestream before it cut out.She said she heard the man rant against America and claim he had a bomb.“He was just all over the map.

Daisy Dog AcademyFriday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  Yvonne MyersDogs’ physiology is not that far removed from our own, their brains are very similar with the two obvious exceptions, we have a much larger frontal lobe area of the brain than dogs which is where we process logical thought and they have a much larger olfactory bulb,  times bigger in fact where they process scent. When our dogs get stressed like us their sympathetic nervous system kicks in and that activates what we call the four Fs, standing for fight, flight, fool around or faint. This is a stress reaction, not dissimilar to our own. We have all heard of the fight or flight response.When a dog is on lead and they have lost the option for flight, this can mean a dog starts displaying what appears to be aggressive behaviour which is in fact all based on fear and stress. They are trying to be big and scary to scare away whatever it is that is scaring them. When we continue to move our dog towards the scary thing, we can damage our dog’s confidence in us as being there for them. This fight response is really their only option as they have no way of escaping.When a dog has a ‘reaction’ to an off-lead dog approaching them and making them feel scared the stress hormone Cortisol is released into their bloodstream along with Adrenaline and noradrenaline, so a huge cocktail of chemicals is released! It can take up to eight hours for the Cortisol to leave the dogs blood stream. That means in one walka dog is made to feel unsafe by an off-lead dog three or four times that is a huge amount for the body to deal with and they will take a long time to recover, the whole day in fact.That can mean that taking the dog out again on the same day will only result in more stress and distress for your dog which is not beneficial to their mental or emotional state. This is very dficult as an owner as you only want to take your dog out and let them have some time out enjoying the environment. If you have a happy go lucky dog that is allowed off lead, that is fantastic for you but, allowing your off-lead dog to approach an on-lead dog that is frightened is not only irresponsible as a dog owner, but it is rude. I have been with clients with dogs on lead in a park and had off lead dogs approaching and, in some cases, harassing the on-lead dog. Their owner has no control over that dog, and they either have made no effort to call them back even when asked to or they have advised me that the dog has no recall. You do not have exclusive rights to spaces to walk your dog. All dogs have the right to have a peaceful and relaxing walk without being approached with unwanted attention. As an owner of a dog that is fearful, they are doing their best to give their dog the best le possible, they are minding their own business with their dog on lead. As a dog owner you have a responsibility under the Dangerous Dog Act to be always in control of your dog in a public space, that is the law. This meansyou are unable to recall your dog or stop your dog from approaching on lead dogs then you should not allow them off lead until you have trained a solid recall. With so many dogs that were bought during lock down we have more and more dogs that are concerned and have higher levels of stress through no fault of their own. They were brought into a world where their socialisation was massively limited, and this has caused them to be more fearful. These dogs need our support, help and understanding. If you areof a dog that is finding the world stressful, be your dogs voice! If your dog has had a stressful interaction do not continue your walk, instead take them home and use their brain through training and using their nose, this will help to calm them and lower their blood pressure and reduce their heart rate. Continuing the walk may be counterproductive for your dog and your emotional state.Do not suffer alone, seek help from a professionalneeded. There are many highly qualied dog trainers who can offer you support and fantastic advice to make your le and your dogs as stress free as possible, but ensure you check their credentials as the dog training world is not regulated and anyone can call themselves a trainer. As the client it is your right to ask about their qualications, never be shy to check, you are doing it for your dog as well as for you.  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularDashcam footage sought of Larne hit-and-run...NewsNewtownabbey schoolgirl struck in hit-and-run at zebra cross...News£ NI Energy Payment Support: who will get it ...NewsFirmus says some properties remain affected after contractor...NewsWoman is accused of stealing steaks...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":null,"title":" rare breed farming families to meet as popular utv series returns ","story":"Man ran off at car park with stolen goods in shopping trolley   Dashcam footage sought of Larne hit-and-runNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPeopleLibby Clarke, a mum-of-two from the Mageralin area, rears award-winning beef Shorthorn and Charolais with her daughter Lucy.

Among the coastal settings for the gesture in Northern Ireland was the Giant’s Causeway, where members of Coleraine Coastguard took part.Coastal Operations Area Commander in Northern Ireland, Robert Steventon, said: “We all share a great sense of pride in HM Coastguard and this milestone anniversary is an opportunity for us to both reflect on what the service has achieved to date and to look to the future and what that may hold. “What won’t change is our commitment to keeping people safe at sea which always has been, and will always be, our reason for doing what we do.” From its beginnings with coastal lookouts to today’s hi-tech national network of coordination centres, from small localised beginnings to international players – one thing has stayed the same for two centuries – Her Majesty’s Coastguard seeks to search, to rescue and to save. It was on January , , that HM Coastguard was formally brought into existence and has been working to keep people safe at the coast and sea ever since. Today, in honour of that actual birthday, coastguards across all four home nations cast throwlines as a symbol of the service’s dedication - past and present. Throwlines, which form part of the lesaving kit used by coastguard teams, will be cast into the seas around Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales at am, with each team operating under the latest Covid- guidance for the local areas. A throwline is used to mark the celebration of  years of HM Coastguard at am on January , . Picture Kevin McAuley McAuley MultimediaOver the past two centuries, HM Coastguard has gone from strength to strength. In , coastguard operations centres coordinate responses to emergency situations at the coast calling on  Coastguard Rescue Teams – made up of , dedicated volunteers – and using  search and rescue helicopter bases. Although the way in which HM Coastguard operates has changed beyond recognition in the last two centuries, it continues to look to the future. Innovation has always been a driver – whether it be pushing forward state of the art technology in the national network of maritime rescue coordination centres or leading the way in rope, water and mud techniques. In December HM Coastguard began to implement its new updated search and rescue radio network which uses fibre technology. More than £million has been invested to upgrade the Coastguard’s national radio network across all  sites over the next two years. The service continues to adapt to changes – in the last few years providing mutual aid and support during events and incidents to other emergency partners. During the pandemic, coastguards supported the NHS, attended the G and COP in  and are called in to support during national emergencies including flooding or supplying water to stranded drivers. Station Officer Alastair Simpson and team from Coleraine Coastguard pictured with Mayor of Causeway Coast  Glens Richard Holmes at the Giants Causeway during their celebration of  years of HM Coastguard at am on January , . Picture Kevin McAuley McAuley MultimediaMaritime Minister, Robert Courts said: “Congratulations HM Coastguard on their -year anniversary. I am immensely proud and humbled by the continued dedication and professionalism from the staff and volunteers which ensures everyone’s safety on our shores and around our coast. “HM Coastguard is the backbone of our maritime sector and the nation is indebted to its incredible workforce which continues to deliver an exceptional service.” Claire Hughes, Director of HM Coastguard said: “When you look at how we started and where we are now, it’s easy to celebrate the innovation and development that can be seen throughout the service. And yet, we are far more proud of the people, the volunteers and the staff who throughout two centuries have continued to strive to keep people safe at the coast and out at sea. We always have and always will respond to those in distress. “While this milestone is an opportunity for us to look back with pride on what we’ve achieved, we have always looked to the future, and I’m proud that we continue to look for ways in which to improve and save lives. I’m proud of the commitment, the dedication and selfless sacrice and I’m proud of how the service has developed and continues to do so.” An HM Coastguard helicopter taking part in an operation in Northern Ireland in .
