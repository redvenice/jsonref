Photograph: iStockIt’s hard to know if the companies that sit on this page’s bold step each week aren’t listening to what people say about them or just don’t give a rashers but one depressing thing a recent customer service report card makes clear is: it is worse they are getting and not better.The CXi Report has been released by the CX Company every autumn since 2015 and by its reckoning, the level of customer experience people get from the top 150 or so companies doing business in Ireland has declined by 10 per cent over the last six years.While many companies’ customer experience (CX) scores benefitted from something of a Covid bounce last year, as they worked harder to make things better in terrible times, the pandemic has dragged on and this year it is more a case of a Covid hangover.The overall CX score fell 4.4 per cent compared with the 2020 figure, making it the biggest year-on-year decline recorded since the survey began. It also means Ireland’s CX score is now at a seven-year low, having recorded a cumulative fall of 10.8 per cent since 2015. And it’s not like things were any good in 2015.Pharmacies and coffee companies have had a strong performance through Covid and make up seven of the top 10 companies, while supermarkets have also done well.However, the entertainment, delivery and telecoms sectors are among the worst performers in the survey, which was carried out by Amárach Research on behalf of the CX Company and based on a cross-section of Irish consumers who were asked for feedback on their experiences with 151 companies across 11 sectors.The identity of the company that featured on the bottom of the pile this year will not come as a surprise to many readers of this page, and the firms who finished just ahead of them won’t exactly shock people out of their socks either.Drum roll please. The worst company for customer experience in Ireland in 2021 was . . . Eir. It replaced Ryanair at the bottom of the heap, although there is no reason for Ryanair to get out the bunting, as it finished third-last just ahead of Facebook which was ranked as the second-worst company in Ireland.All told, almost one in two – or 44 per cent – of Eir’s customers said the company had failed to meet their expectations over the last year, while 25 per cent said the same about Ryanair.The Department of Social Protection and Irish Water were both on 24 per cent, while Sky also fared badly with 23 per cent of its customers saying it had failed to meet their expectations.The Passport Service, the National Lottery, Adverts.ie and Abrakebabra were among the other companies who did badly in their customers’ eyes, recording big falls in the annual chart.At the other end of the table, the credit unions finished on top of the pile for the seventh year in a row, making it the only brand to have maintained a constant presence in the top 10 since the survey began.Customer service proved to be no game for Smyths Toys which moved up 30 places to claim second, thanks – at least in part – to what CX Ireland describes as a “highly efficient pick, pack and ship operation which they created in record time”.Hickeys, McCabes, Lloyds, McCauleys and Boots all made the top 10, proof of the important role pharmacies played in keeping customers well – especially vulnerable patients – and in helping to battle the virus through the vaccination programme.Supermarkets continue to perform well – this year they are represented in the top 10 by Aldi, which replaced Lidl – indicating the important role they have played in the past year.Some of the biggest jumpers in the 2021 league table included Energia, Lifestyle Sports, Free Now and An Post Money.Two of the new entrants are coffee companies, Nespresso and Butlers Chocolates, who both devised novel ways of serving customers who still wanted to treat themselves.The chairman of The CX Company, Michael Killeen, described Eir’s treatment of its customers as appalling. “The telecom sector has been one of the poorest performers in our survey over the last seven years,” he says. “While Eir is the standout offender and seems more focused on making money for its owners rather than doing what’s right for their customers, its competitors Sky and Virgin would also recognise more work needs to be done to deliver greater customer experiences.”He noted that “entertainment and travel obviously faced huge challenges this year and this goes a long way to explaining their poor performance”.He added: “Logistics and delivery is a new sector this year and one where companies are struggling to keep up with increased demand. The other key issue for companies such as Fastway, UPS, Parcel Motel, DHL and An Post is managing the resolution of issues when they arise.“The financial sector hasn’t had a great Covid and its response to the current high levels of attempted fraud has been underwhelming to say the least. The public sector is another which could do better – the Department of Social Protection and even the HSE failing to meet customer expectations.”Post-Covid: ‘Goodwill is fading fast and customers have a lot less tolerance’ Cathy Summers of CX Ireland is the author of the report and she described, with a degree of understatement, the low score as “a concern”.She accepted that since early 2020 companies had been battling the effects of Covid, but said they now needed to “refocus their efforts on enhancing the customer journey and overall experience”.Summers suggested: “Post-Covid indecision and fatigue appear to be taking a toll on companies and their approach to CX. As a result, customers are losing out. Whereas these very customers were quite forgiving during Covid as organisations struggled to adapt to new processes and procedures, that goodwill is fading fast and customers have a lot less tolerance now. Especially if there are long delays answering or communicating with the organisation.”She added: “During Covid many companies invested in digital solutions to interact with customers as a necessity due to lockdowns. While these can work well and yield savings, sometimes, they can be more focused on the short-term needs of the company rather than the needs of the customer. In our report, we are seeing a real hunger from customers to get back to personal one-on-one interactions. They want empathy and reassurance sometimes they just want to talk to a fellow human being.”How the rankings work Summers also explained how the rankings work. People who take part are asked to rank the companies they have had dealings with out of 10, with any score over eight deemed to be an excellent customer service experience.In 2015 the average across all the companies assessed was 7.06, while this year it stands at 6.32. There are very few brands who got more than eight.She said the top ranking of the credit unions was a “phenomenal achievement”, even though their score did fall slightly this year when compared with 2020. They were still significantly ahead of the chasing pack and pointed to “a gap of 75 per cent between their score and the bottom brand score”.She said Smyths employees “went out of their way to help customers”, and suggested that often it was the little things staff did that made all the difference. “It might be a small thing but it made a big difference, and those experiences are driven by people, humans. I think one of the overall themes of this year’s report was that digital is important and customers want to do things digitally but, you know, they’re very much a transaction. There’s no emotional connection there – and that’s what you need to create that experience.”Summers said: “Doing the right thing is what customer experience is all about. It is about being able to empower employees to make those decisions to pick up the phone and ask somebody if they’re actually having problems, to take that common sense approach, you know, like imagining if it was your brother, mother, granny or whoever, what would you do to help them out?”She said too many companies trained their frontline employees “on processes and systems, and they don’t actually remember that their employees are people as well and there’s a really strong link between employee experience and customer experience – because if your employees aren’t having a good experience, you can’t expect them to give one to customers. A lot of it for me comes down to how much the employers trust the employees to actually, you know, do the right thing, use their common sense. And obviously, yes, they need support in terms of education, training, but being able to be empowered to do the right thing. And also know that if they do make a mistake, you know, it’s not the end of the world.”She pointed out that last year was a bad year for the Passport Service and the National Lottery. “It’s an interesting one,” she said, “because we also measure where companies have exceeded or failed to meet customer expectations, and the passport service actually score really highly on both counts. And I think, you know, they do a fantastic job but I think they struggled because of not being able to have the office open to provide that backup for people, particularly where they had emergencies.”And were people disappointed by the National Lottery because they didn’t win the Lotto? Or was that just Pricewatch? “Maybe it was because a lot of people couldn’t get in to actually play it in physical stores so they had to go online and that caused a challenge for them. I think that probably had quite a lot to do with it.”It should be noted that the Lotto app is very easy to use once you are set up and get the hang of it, so were people getting frustrated because they were struggling with the unfamiliar and then blaming the company? “Yes, absolutely,” she said. “Having to do things online if you’re not used to it or you’ve got a certain way that you like to do things and you have to change your behaviours and your habits and you feel like you’re being forced to do that, you know, can have a negative impact on how people view their experience – because customers do want to do certain things in certain ways with certain companies.”She said Ryanair improved its scores in 2021 compared with a terrible 2020 when it clocked up the lowest score in the history of the survey last year.“I think for some industries, particularly like travel, also the telecom sector, they had real struggles. It’s about equating the importance that some of these companies play in our lives. So, being able to travel obviously was a key one. We were restricted. But how that was handled, when it was opened up, was key.”When it comes to the telecoms companies, Summers said: “We are so dependent on being connected. And if we aren’t connected or there’s a problem, it’s a major, major issue. You go to the supermarket and you can’t get any milk – it’s not a big deal. You can just go somewhere else.”And how does a company address bad ratings? “It’s really being able to understand where the pain points are for customers. So what are the things that are causing the most frustrations, the most issues? So looking at each transaction or interaction that a customer has and where are the pain points for them?“I think a lot of companies have gone down the digital route and sometimes the technology isn’t fit for purpose. And they’ve done it to save money – so they’ve done it for their own needs, rather than the customer needs. And then what can happen is that the customers can’t use the technology or have queries and that generates more calls into the company as well.“And it’s really about being able to understand their customers. Think about them as human beings, understand what they need and be able to invest in improving the customer experience rather than just trying to save money.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mary o rourke the day i announced our worst ever pupil teacher ratio","story":"Taoiseach Charles Haughey, alongside Mary O’Rourke, greets a supporter at a Fianna Fáil ard fheis in 1991. Photograph: Eamonn FarrellRollingNews.ieA headline in an article in The  on October 13th said it all: “Pupil-teacher ratio to fall to lowest level yet.” That headline really arrested me and, of course, brought me to the inevitable comparison with the budget of March 31st, 1987.I was minister for education then, with the bad news that the pupil-teacher ratio was to rise to the highest level yet.Now, that wasn’t in any headline, but that was the import of what was announced with the budget on that date from the Department of Education. I will always remember the circular in fact it is printed in large letters on my brain forever, the fact that the pupil-teacher ratio was going to rise by three. That was the bad news contained in circular 2087.Can you imagine the mayhem that created? We were new in government, and Charlie Haughey and minister for finance “Mac the Knife” Ray McSharry were determined to put a shape on the economic future of Ireland, which was at a really low level. Education and health were targeted as the fall guys for their onslaught on the finances of the country.I was the newbie in education and what an awful way to be introduced to the teaching fraternity. I couldn’t defend that stipulation of a rise in the pupil-teacher ratio, no matter how I tried. I remember so well the late Christina Murphy, who was then The  education expert, kept asking me: “But, how is this going to improve education?” Of course, there was no answer to it. It wasn’t going to improve it in fact it was going to worsen it.Rí-rá all over the country ensued, and then both Bertie Ahern as minister for Labour and the taoiseach, Haughey, embarked on talks with the trade unions which culminated in the Programme for National Recovery (PNR), which was clarified and announced in OctoberNovember 1987.Coincidentally, that’s exactly 34 years ago now. This was a groundbreaking trade union-government agreement, which led to huge improvement in the economic life of the country and in which both sides gave up much but acquired an economic stability for Ireland.The unions were led by the magnificent Peter Cassells and each inidual union, of course, had its own remit and its own conclusion which culminated, as I said, in the PNR. This started an economic revival right through the very late 1980s and into the early 1990s. For me, the salient point of the PNR was that the doom-laden news officially announced of the rise in the pupil-teacher ratio was quietly forgotten, tucked away among the many good points of the Programme for National Recovery. Oh, was I glad!Can you imagine, the dire news, though announced, was quietly wrapped up in the government-trade union relationship and, in fact, never saw the light of day. The whole episode, particularly the circular of 2087, has never left my mind from then on, I was determined that, whatever daft notion towards education emanated from the Department of Finance, I would fight it tooth and nail.From that time on, the teaching unions never failed to say that we had the worst pupil-teacher ratio in the whole of Europe. And now, the announcement which I have quoted above, bringing the pupil-teacher ratio down to the lowest level yet, truly marks a milestone in Irish education history. This has been planned to commence in September of the next academic year. Allied to that will be a fall in enrolment to primary schools. It is hoped, no matter what the economic outlook will be, the vista of the fall in the pupil-teacher ratio will continue now that it has started.So goodbye to the dreaded 2087, and hello to a future of falling pupil-teacher ratios.Of course, the education budget contained much more than the pupil-teacher ratio. There were good inroads on special education in particular, which will be duly acclaimed.But 34 years on from the budget of March 31st, 1987, and the subsequent Programme for National Recovery, education is, we hope, on a downward trajectory of pupil-teacher ratio. Education has truly been well served by the headline of October 13th, 2021. Long may it continue. I’m going to banish forever from my head the memory of 2087.Mary O’Rourke is an author and former government minister"},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 world must step up now on climate action obama says","story":"Former US president Barack Obama, speaking at Cop26 in Glasgow, has lambasted those who would play politics to avoid acting on climate change, calling out Russia and China in the same breath as Republican politicians in America. Video: ReutersFormer US president Barack Obama and US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry arrive at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. Photograph: Jane BarlowPA WireThe world “has to step up, and it has to step up now” in response to climate change, former US president Barrack Obama has said in an address to the UN Cop26 summit in Glasgow.As the gathering faces into its final days of hard negotiation on a deal to limit the extent of global heating, Mr Obama said the climate crisis was the one thing that must transcend day-to-day politics and geopolitics.“What is also true, collectively and inidually we are still falling short. We have not done nearly enough to address this crisis, we will need to do more,” Mr Obama said in a speech to a plenary gathering.He declared “the US is back” at the forefront of global climate action after “stalling” during the Trump years, and went on to criticise Chinese president Xi Jinping and Russian president Vladimir Putin for not joining other leaders at the summit. He said he believed this suggested “a dangerous lack of urgency”.At a closed meeting of members of the “high ambition coalition” (HAC) – which includes Ireland – Mr Obama is understood to have firmly supported developing countries pushing for a climate deal limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees.In his speech earlier, Mr Obama acknowledged progress already made by negotiators in Glasgow but warned that gaps needed to be bridged in coming days.‘More at stake’The biggest force for facing up to the scale of action needed was among young people, he said. “The reason is simple – they have more at stake in this fight than anyone else... If those older people won’t listen, they need to get out the way.”Addressing HAC ministers including Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan, Mr Obama said: “What you are doing – what the HAC is attempting to accomplish – is vital.”Noting the coalition’s role in 2015 in ensuring the 1.5 degree target was written into the Paris agreement, he added: “The brutal tempests of the warming climate are making even clearer that we cross that line at our peril. Once again… it falls on the HAC to make that case.”“You’ve come together once again to speak to not only the need to get to 1.5 degrees, but also to provide the adaptation funding that’s necessary for those who may end up paying the steepest price for actions that they themselves did not take.”A draft statement from the HAC circulated on Monday notes “deep concern” over the gap between existing commitments on emissions made at Cop26 and far deeper cuts needed to limit global heating to within 1.5 degrees, “in this decisive decade”. Not all countries in the coalition have signed the statement, but 40 current signatories include groups of developing countries: the Alliance of Small Island States, the Least Developed Countries and the African Group.‘Diplomatic bullying’Bolivia’s chief negotiator Diego Pacheco Balanza has criticised a refusal by richer countries to discuss loss and damage or compensation at Cop26 as evidence of “diplomatic bullying”.“There’s been a systematic attempt by developed countries to remove all discussion about responsibility, compensation and direct climate finance from the negotiations, it’s shameful,” he said.“Instead, they want us to focus on carbon markets and their 2050 net zero narrative, which is completely meaningless. The net zero narrative is a big lie. We need to eliminate greenhouse gases now, not in 30 years.”The first draft of the “Glasgow decision text” published on Monday, which contains no mention of phasing out fossil fuels, was described as exceptionally weak by Jennifer Morgan, director of Greenpeace International.“Usually the text starts with some ambition, which then gets watered down,” she said. “To keep 1.5 alive, four words must be added: ‘fossil fuels phase out’, and countries must come back next year to close the gap.”"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Of some 240 known wetland species, almost 70 have been listed for Red List protectionStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"revised dublin transport plan sees costs double to 25bn and rail projects delayed","story":"The proposed Dart Underground line, linking Heuston Station to the Dart line by tunnelling under the city via St Stephen’s Green, will not be built before 2042, according to the NTA No metro lines will be developed to the south or west of Dublin, and the Dart underground line has been shelved for at least 20 years following a review of the National Transport Authority (NTA) strategy for the capital.The cost of implementing the Greater Dublin Area Transport Strategy for the next 20 years has more than doubled from €10.3 billion to €25 billion. However, planned major rail projects – including Luas lines to Finglas, Lucan, Poolbeg and Bray, as well as the link and Navan rail lines – are not expected to be delivered until after 2031, with the long-awaited Dart underground excluded from the 20-year programme.Planning permission for the link line from Swords and Dublin Airport to the city is due to be sought next year, and options for a future extension of the line to the south or southwest of the city were considered under the year-long review of the strategy.However, in its draft 2022-2042 strategy for Dublin published on Tuesday, the NTA has determined these areas should instead be served by the development of new Luas lines. However, these lines will not be developed until after 2042.NTA deputy chief executive Hugh Creegan said a future line running from Sandyford through UCDStillorgan Road into the city centre would “take the load off the green line” meaning it would “not be required to be upgraded to metro standard”.In relation to the prospects of taking the metro west through Terenure and Rathfarnham, he said a “thorough assessment” during the review period had found the “benefits of the project were less than the cost of the project”.The strategy sets out proposals for improving bus provision, cycling and pedestrian infrastructure, as well as the road network, but its central focus is on the expansion of rail. In addition to the four Luas lines due to be delivered post-2031, planning and design work will be done on eight more Luas routes – to Clongriffin, Balgriffin, Tyrellstown, Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, TallaghtKimmage, TallaghtKnocklyon and the UCD Sandyford line. However, no construction is due to take place on these lines before 2042.Hopes were this year revived for the Dart underground line, shelved a decade ago following the economic crash, when it emerged the NTA had engaged consultants to devise route options for the line.However, the line linking Heuston Station to the Dart line by tunnelling under the city via St Stephen’s Green will also not be built before 2042, with the NTA committing instead to “preserve and protect an alignment to allow its future delivery subsequent to the strategy period”.Also dropped from the strategy is the Eastern Bypass. The road, which in previous transport strategies involved an extension of the M50 under Sandymount Strand, has been consistently opposed by Dublin politicians.It is “not proceeding”, the NTA said, but a “south port access route which will link from the national road network at the Dublin tunnel to serve the south port lands and adjoining areas is included”. It is likely this will involve a bridge across the Liffey. Cycling measuresThe transport strategy, which is updated every five years, has a stronger focus on walking and cycling measures than previously, with an aspiration to provide “traffic-free streets” in town centres where there are “benefits to transport andor the local environment  economy”.As well as increasing cycle infrastructure, the expansion and “interoperability” of bike-sharing schemes and the ability to bring bikes on public transport, which is currently very limited, is proposed.There will be “no significant increase in capacity for private car trips” on radial roads within the metropolitan area, except where realignments or junction changes are necessary for safety reasons, it said, while road schemes will be designed to provide “safe and appropriate arrangement to facilitate walking, cycling and public transport provision”.Speed limits will be reduced and variable limits introduced under the plan, along with car-free zones and a “reduction in public sector parking in city centres”, the report said.The draft report is available for public consultation until December 17th."},{"url":null,"title":"the luas was the light at the end of the tunnel say disappointed lucan locals","story":" Cllr Joanna Tuffy, with traffic congestion in Lucan Village, Lucan, Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill  The Lucan residents were first told a Luas line would be extended to their area in 2008.Now, with a delay of at least another 10 years for the project, the residents of the west Dublin suburb feel like they “might never get it at this stage”.On Tuesday, the National Transport Authority (NTA) published its draft transport plan for the Greater Dublin Area, under which no new train or tram lines will be built within the next decade.According to the scheme, planned major rail projects including Luas lines to Finglas, Lucan, Poolbeg and Bray, as well as the  and Navan rail lines, are not expected to be delivered until after 2031.Labour party Cllr Joanna Tuffy, from Lucan, said congestion is a huge problem in the village, and an increase in bus capacity through BusConnects will not be enough to meet demand. “The one thing we were kind of hoping for was the luas for Lucan. The buses won’t make the kind of difference that the Luas would make, with the reliability and the speed,” she said.“It really transformed places like Tallaght. People were hoping that was on the way here.”Cllr Tuffy added that there is a “huge number of new houses” about to be built.“The Luas was the light at the end of the tunnel that could reach areas that currently aren’t being catered for by the train and things like that. It honestly seems like we never get it at this stage,” she said.According to the NTA, the northside link will not be completed until at least 2031, while the  South section would not be proceeding.The south metro project would have involved upgrading the Luas Green line to Charlemont to  standard but a planned Luas line to SandyfordUCD would mean this would not be needed, according to the NTA’s director of planning and transport.The Dublin Commuter Coalition, a group campaigning for a better transport system, described this move as “disappointing”.Feljin Jose, the group’s spokesman, said getting  North to the statutory planning stage next year would be a “huge milestone”.However, he added that it had to be delivered by 2032 by the “absolute latest”, and any further delays would be “completely unacceptable”.“We need to halve our transport emissions by 2030, but there will be no new luas lines and no new metros in that time. The plan is hopelessly bad. We expected a lot more,” Mr Jose said.However, the campaign group highlighted that the plan is a draft and can still change. They encouraged members of the public to make a submission to improve the provisions. The underground Dart plan has also been shelved for at least 20 years,which the campaign group said is a “big thing”.“It’s something we should have built decades ago, and to think we might only get it in the 2050s is a testament to how poor the ambition is with regards to transport in this country,” he added. Eugene Barrett, from the  South West group, which represents 39 residents’ associations, expressed considerable disappointment that there will be no metro lines serving his area.“There’s an overdependence on BusConnects to deliver the moving of people out of cars. In Dublin South West, the pinch points of Terenure, Harold’s Cross and Rathmines, they’re still there and they cannot handle the extra number of busses,” he said.On the Link, he said it was just “putting it off another 10 years”, adding that the lack of a line on the south side “comes as a big blow”.“It’s not really giving us much for the immediate future. There’s more and more houses being built at a rapid pace and they just don’t see any alternative to getting out of their cars,” he added."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 3 578 new cases reported as holohan says testing essential for those with symptoms","story":"More than 44,000 cases of Covid-19 have been reported in Ireland in the last 14 days.

And of course it remains essential that anyone with symptoms isolates and gets tested.”No fresh restrictionsFresh restrictions on the hospitality sector are not on the cards before Christmas but Government officials have warned that they are concerned about a lack of compliance with Covid-19 certs particularly among younger age groups.A meeting was held on Tuesday afternoon between senior officials and members of the hospitality industry where the industry said there was a need to impose tougher sanctions and fines on venues that are found not be complying with public health requirements.It is understood there was some concern before the meeting that rising Covid case numbers could raise the spectre of restrictions being reimposed but sources present at the meeting said they now do not feel that this is the case and that there is no indication of this being the plan in the coming weeks.It is understood that Government officials were somewhat resistant to imposing a system of new sanctions on pubs, restaurants and other venues but that industry made a strong case for it to happen.On foot of multiple requests, the Government told stakeholders that they would consider the matter further.Sources said the main topic of concern seems to be the 18-24 age group and a lack of compliance with the requirement for Covid-19 certs in places such as nightclubs. A new communication plan will be rolled out in the coming weeks.Speaking after the meeting, a spokesman for the Restaurants Association of Ireland said they had a “productive, full and frank meeting with deputy CMO Dr Ronan Glynn, Government officials from the departments of Taoiseach, Health, Tourism and Enterprise plus HSE \u0026amp HSA.”“The hospitality industry representatives collectively has called for stronger sanctions including penalties, fines and closures for hospitality businesses flouting the regulations and breaching Covid-19 guidelines.“Government officials engaged with hospitality representatives in a proactive and informative manner in terms of presentation of public health communication plans, Covid health data and hospital capacity as we head into the winter period.”The Cabinet also discussed the Covid-19 situation on Tuesday morning. Ministers were told the next two weeks will be key in determining the future trajectory of the disease and that Government is closely watching the numbers in hospital and intensive care.Tuesday’s meeting comes after it emerged that compliance rates with Covid-19 measures have been falling in recent weeks. The information was contained in research from the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).The number of people not having their Covid-19 passes checked in pubs rose from 21 per cent to 37 per cent, and despite a rise in people dining indoors in restaurants, more than one in three or 34 per cent of diners were not asked for digital Covid certs, according to the latest ESRI survey.On Monday, a further 3,161 new cases of Covid-19 were reported in the State with almost 500 people in hospital, and 78 in intensive care units.It was the seventh day in a row that daily new cases exceeded 3,000.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"department of education removes homophobic teaching material","story":"The material was included in online teaching resources provided by the department for social, personal and health education (SPHE) classes at Junior Cycle level until recent months.The Department of Education removed online teaching material criticised as “homophobic,” which asked secondary school students to discuss a number of statements, including whether “all gays molest children”.The material was included in online teaching resources provided by the department for social, personal and health education (SPHE) classes at Junior Cycle level until recent months.The teaching booklet directs students to read through several statements and outline whether they agreed or disagreed with them.The statements said “all gays are HIV positive”, “boys who don’t play sport are gay”, “you can change from being a homosexual”, “girls who don’t wear make-up are lesbian”, and “homosexuals shouldn’t be allowed to marry”.The Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) teaching material had been written in the late 1990s.The National LGBT Federation said it was “disturbing” such teaching material was “ever considered appropriate”.In a statement on Twitter, the organisation said LGBT+ students deserve a “fact-based, inclusive” RSE curriculum, not “harmful and offensive” debates about their identities.Concerns were raised with the department over the teaching resource material this April, a department spokesman said.

RTBF is a right in European law that intends to allow personal information about someone to be removed from internet search results, under certain circumstances.The underlying principle is that after a certain period of time information about a private inidual should no longer be relevant about that person, and thus it would generally be considered unfair for this information to still be available, and in particular, prominently displayed in search results.How does the law work?

Ireland and the EU expects the UK to trigger Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol in the coming weeks. This unilateral action would effectively suspend the operation of the protocol and have far-reaching consequences for EU-UK relations. So what is Article 16? Article 16 is part of the Northern Ireland protocol, the section of the Brexit withdrawal agreement which deals with the North. The protocol avoided a hard border on the island of Ireland by placing a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea, which means additional paperwork and physical checks on some goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. A small number of items can no longer be imported to Northern Ireland from GB, and some suppliers in Britain have stopped selling to the North. Unionists and loyalists are opposed to the protocol, which they claim has changed Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the UK, and has caused trading difficulties, and there have been repeated calls for Article 16 to be triggered to address these issues. In September the four largest unionist parties issued a joint declaration reaffirming their opposition to the protocol and their “unalterable position that the protocol must be rejected and replaced.” What does Article 16 say? Article 16 is the protocol’s emergency cord. If the application of the protocol leads to “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist, or to ersion of trade”, under Article 16 either the UK or the EU “may unilaterally take appropriate safeguard measures.” It stipulates that these measures “shall be restricted with regard to their scope and duration to what is strictly necessary in order to remedy the situation”, with the other party entitled - if the safeguarding measure employed creates an “imbalance between the rights and obligations” under the protocol - to take “such proportionate rebalancing measures as are strictly necessary” to remedy the situation. The UK government has already said - in its Command Paper in July - that it is “clear the circumstances exist to justify using Article 16” as there has been “significant” disruption to trade between GB and NI as well as political and community instability. What happens if it is triggered? Initially, more talking. Annex seven - which outlines how Article 16 will operate - states that where either the EU or the UK is considering taking safeguarding measures it shall notify the other “without delay”, providing all relevant information, and shall “immediately enter into consultations in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution.” Neither party may take safeguarding measures until “one month has elapsed after the date of notification.” However, there is a caveat in the case of “exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action”, in which case the “protective measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation” may be applied “forthwith”. Given that the UK government has maintained the conditions for triggering Article 16 have existed for some months, it would be difficult to justify need for immediate action that said, it has already demonstrated its willingness to take unilateral action in regard to Brexit, so this cannot be ruled out. What will happen in that scenario? Practically, little is likely to change in the short term. Earlier unilateral action by the UK government to extend some grace periods indefinitely means the scope for change on the ground in Northern Ireland is limited. The speculation is that the UK may use the triggering of Article 16 to go further and to force other changes, which could spiral into a trade war and the collapse of the Brexit trade agreement. Inevitably, it will worsen the already strained relations between Dublin and Brussels on the one hand and London on the other, and will be seen as further evidence of “bad faith”, as Mr Coveney put it, on the part of the UK government. Strained relations - and indeed heightened tensions - over Brexit are nothing new in the North it will be seen as a short term win for opponents of the protocol, who have seen their demand to trigger Article 16 delivered upon, but in the medium to longer term it is hard to see how it will do anything to calm already troubled waters. Aodhán Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, summed up the potential impact for businesses he could easily be speaking for society at large. “What article 16 does it the opposite of what business needs. Business needs stability, business needs certainty, what triggering Article 16 does is give us not only more uncertainty, not only more instability, but long protracted negotiations again.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"as un summit enters final days cat analysis confirms new promises coming up short","story":"CAT says  temperature rises will top 2.4 degrees by the end of this century based on the short-term goals countries have set out. Photograph: Getty ImagesThe world is on track for catastrophic levels of global heating far in excess of the limits in the Paris agreement despite increased carbon-cutting pledges from governments made at Cop26, according to Climate Action Tracker (CAT).The latest verdict of CAT – the world’s most respected climate analysis coalition – provided a stark warning to almost 200 countries gathered in Glasgow as negotiations enter their most challenging phase. Temperature rises will top 2.4 degrees by the end of this century based on the short-term goals countries have set out, CAT concludes in its latest analysis. That would far exceed the 2-degree upper limit of the Paris agreement, and 1.5 degree limit aimed for at the Cop26 talks. At that level widespread extreme weather – sea-level rises, drought, floods, heatwaves and fiercer storms – would cause devastation across the globe, it predicts.The estimate is in sharp contrast to optimistic forecasts last week suggesting warming could be held to 1.9 degrees or 1.8 degrees, thanks to commitments announced at the talks.The UK, as hosts of Cop26, were due to release overnight a first draft of the summit communiqué, which will led to consultations with national capitals across the globe. US climate envoy John Kerry said he expected the talks to produce a deal on carbon-trading rules, and predicted the US “won’t have coal” by 2030. However, Cop26 president Alok Sharma said more progress was needed in negotiations to secure a broad-based deal.

It’s helped to strengthen the all-island economy with increased trade north-south and south-north and also to protect the single market and our place in it which is really crucial to us.“It has caused some disruption to trade from Britain into Northern Ireland, Maros Sefcovic and the European Union have put forward proposals to resolve most of those issues, unfortunately they haven’t been accepted by the British,” he said.Suspending the Trade and Cooperation Agreement was something that the European Commission would have to consider, he said. “Bear in mind that invoking Article 16 doesn’t set aside the protocol - some people think that, it doesn’t.“It’s a safeguarding mechanism. The first thing that has to happen is we have to enter talks for about a month and what that really means — what it does allow Britain to do is to take unilateral measures, but they can only be time limited and they can only be proportionate.” How is Brexit affecting you?

Photograph: Christopher FurlongGetty ImagesThe Cop26 summit will generate significant momentum for climate actions across the globe if a detailed and precise rulebook on implementing the landmark Paris agreement emerges from Glasgow this week, Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan has said. Mr Ryan said that even if only a majority of countries supported a rulebook reinforced by “the same rules, the same reporting, and the same timelines”, it would “build momentum for the decisions you need to take in business, in transport and elsewhere”.The Green Party leader, who is heading the Irish delegation at the conference, took part in the Adaptation Fund Contributor Dialogue, an initiative aimed at scaling up funding to help countries vulnerable to climate change to adapt to its impacts. Ireland is to contribute at least €10 million by the end of next year in the form of grants for developing countries, he said.Adaptation challengeAddressing the adaptation challenge would require an unprecedented level of international co-operation, Mr Ryan said. “I believe it can be done and Ireland is determined to play its part, during the final days of Cop26 this week but also through our efforts at home.”Speaking at the same event, US climate envoy John Kerry said the coming week “can define the decade” in terms of global climate action, warning that if emissions were not reduced enough by 2030, achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 would be impossible. “The stakes here could not be higher,” he added. Mr Ryan told a press briefing that Cop26 would achieve a good outcome if the rulebook is “absolutely precise” on timelines for reviews and how governments report on their “national determined contributions” for reducing emissions. On reducing methane, he agreed it was the fastest and most effective way to cut emissions. While an international pact, backed by the Government, aiming to reduce global methane levels by 30 per cent by 2030 was not a national target, he believed Ireland would be “centrally involved in addressing methane arising from agriculture and land use”.OffsettingOn a push for carbon markets with options for big business to offset emissions in developing countries, he said he would be nervous about that given the chequered history of offsetting.Ireland has joined the National Adaptation Plan Global Network and committed €1 million to help developing countries build national adaptation plans and become climate-resilient. Minister of State for Overseas Development Aid Colm Brophy announced the funding, which will support small island developing states and the least-developed countries “to strengthen transparency, accountability and inclusion in climate action with a focus on tracking progress on adaptation”. He added: “Adaptation prioritises the needs of those communities most exposed to, and already living with, the impacts of climate change. As such, it is a core priority of Ireland’s international climate action. We are delighted to support the network and look forward to working with likeminded countries in delivering real impact through this group.”Mr Brophy said he hoped to see the commitment to provide $100 billion a year for developing countries as soon as possible underpinned by progress this week towards the target. Commenting on Cop26, he said: “I think there has been a sea change. It’s the first Cop where there is a real meaningful understanding and work with climate finance and adaptation at the heart of it... I hope that will build up trust.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics sinn fein a party preparing for government","story":"At Sinn Féin’s ardfheis in Dublin last weekend, a motion in support of the non-jury Special Criminal Court was passed, representing a considerable shift in position and removing a significant hurdle to the party’s ambitions to lead the next government.

Photograph: Aidan CrawleyThe government led by Brian Cowen was already doomed when, in January of 2011, it was revealed that the then taoiseach had played golf with the chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, Seán FitzPatrick, and two of the bank’s directors just weeks before the 2008 bank guarantee which – disastrously – tethered the financial fortunes of the State to the doomed bank.For many people, the July golf outing at Druid’s Glen in Wicklow was the perfect summary of the closeness of banking and property development to politics and regulators that had led the country to disaster. They were all in it together. Of course they were playing golf with each other.The golf game entered political mythology. All the participants would swear that banking matters were not discussed, but rather the conversations – which began during a meeting in FitzPatrick’s house in Greystones before the lads hit the fairways – centred on the general economic situation in the country at the time. FatefulIn hindsight, we may have all been better off if the affairs of Anglo Irish Bank had been discussed during the round it might not have done anything for anyone’s scores, but if the bankers had told the politicians about the true state of affairs at Anglo that fateful summer, perhaps the guarantee, which ultimately cost the State about €34 billion, wouldn’t have been supplied. At least not to Anglo. And yet, the Cowen-FitzPatrick golf game was the perfect illustration of the banking-property-politics nexus that had driven the latter part of the spectacular economic boom and was now on the verge of imploding into a cataclysmic bust. Anglo had mushroomed in size on the back of massive property lending in a booming economy. That economic boom didn’t just deliver bonuses for the bankers, though it delivered re-election twice for Bertie Ahern’s Fianna Fáil, in 2002 and 2007. It was this co-incidence of interests between the bankers, the builders and the politicians, while regulators and auditors took everyone’s word for everything, that meant there was no hearing for those who urged caution. When economists like UCD professor Morgan Kelly urged caution, Bertie Ahern joked that he didn’t understand why they didn’t commit suicide.When Ahern, with his unerring timing, departed and Cowen took over, the bank had already begun a period of close contacts with government that would end in disaster for both. Shortly before he became taoiseach, invited by his close friend and adviser Fintan Drury – who was a member of the bank’s board – Cowen attended a dinner with senior Anglo figures at its St Stephen’s Green headquarters. FitzPatrick’s successor, David Drumm, would later claim that he had pressured Cowen to persuade the State’s treasury agency, the NTMA, to increase its deposits with the bank, already experiencing funding strains. Cowen would later deny this. It is true that the political system as a whole failed in restraining itself and planning prudently for the future. But FitzPatrick will always be associated with Fianna Fáil, and his fall with that of the party. During the heady years of the Celtic Tiger, FitzPatrick’s links with government were probably no closer than the head of a major bank would expect. Then again, they didn’t have to be: the Fianna Fáil-led government had delivered everything – a booming economy, light-touch regulation, low taxes – that FitzPatrick could reasonably have wished for. When the bust came, he went running to the State for help. It was forthcoming. And so FitzPatrick’s bank bankrupted not just itself, and its creator – it bankrupted the entire country."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Circassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"ex council chief found washed swedish coast five months going","story":"A retired council chief, who died after going windsurfing in 40mph winds, was found washed up on the coast of Sweden 600 miles away, an inquest heard.Chris Bamfield, 65, a highly experienced windsurfer, was seen out on his board on November 14 last year at Hunstanton, Norfolk.His wife, Vanessa, reported him missing at 5.17pm after he failed to return to their home in Middleton, near King\u0027s Lynn.Norfolk coroner\u0027s court in Norwich heard how six search and rescue teams, lifeboats and two fixed wing aircraft were launched to find the councillor.But the search, which covered the entire area of The Wash, was called off on the morning of November 16 when it was assumed he was lost at sea.His board and its red and white sail were later recovered in the North Sea around 21 miles off the Norfolk coast, and his body eventually washed up on April 6 this year on Stora Korno beach in Bohuslan, Sweden.Interpol told Norfolk Police on April 20 that a body matching the description of Mr Bamfield had been found.The inquest heard that DNA tests confirmed the remains were those of Mr Bamfield, who had recently retired as executive director of King\u0027s Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council.A post-mortem conducted in Sweden gave his primary cause of death as drowning, but found that he had also had circulation issues.Reports from Mr Bamfield\u0027s GP confirmed he had been diagnosed as having high cholesterol, but had declined statin medication as he wanted to treat himself through diet and fitness.Norfolk area coroner Yvonne Blake recorded a conclusion of accidental death due to drowning while windsurfing.Ms Blake said: Although he had slightly high cholesterol, it didn\u0027t seem to be in the dreadful range.

As is the way of these things, the justification for this sweeping generalisation is to single out a unique case and pretend it is not unique, but common. On this occasion we are invited to point the finger of condemnation at Geoffrey Cox, the former attorney general who has cheerfully declared an extra income of £400,000 for providing legal services to the British Virgin islands.Nice work if you can get it. But the truth is that only one out of 650 MPs can actually get it, and that lucky inidual is Mr Cox. So, not typical of “sleaze” at all. Not even sleaze, in fact, since the Devon MP has lifted not a finger to hide his lucre (filthy or otherwise). Further, his extra-curricular activities seem to bother his constituents not at all, since they continue to re-elect Cox with ever increasing majorities every time his name appears on the ballot paper.Labour MPs have spent the last couple of days doing two things. The first is to drop the shadow cabinet Word of the Day – “corruption” – into every single sentence whenever they’re being interviewed by broadcast media. They seem to believe this is awfully clever and are no doubt quite proud of the way they’re subliminally inserting the Labour message into our subconscious without our suspecting a thing.The second tactic is to claim that second jobs for parliamentarians are a terrible thing if you’re a Conservative MP, because Eton and Boris and everything. But if you’re a Labour MP with a second job, then that’s perfectly fine because you’re either working in A\u0026ampE or rescuing puppies from trees. Presumably, then, the independent inquiry Labour are demanding into MPs’ second jobs will differentiate the worthiness of such jobs before issuing a partial ban based on party affiliation… sorry, I mean, based on value to society of the work done.MPs shouldn’t be paid as lobbyists. Why it took the Owen Paterson affair to reveal this obvious truth is a mystery, but we got there in the end. Banning all second jobs, however, is a different matter and it remains to be seen what benefit such a move would bring anyone, other than the schadenfreude of seeing the likes of Geoffrey Cox being forced to ditch parliament to maintain his and his family’s standard of living.This hostility to second jobs is based on two things. The first is an awareness – not quite jealousy, but close – of the fact that Tory MPs, having come from a business background, are much more likely to be offered those lucrative side lines. Whereas many Labour MPs – having come straight from a sit-in at the students’ union – have no such skills to offer employers.The second is that the job of MP has changed gradually over the last century and, in the last decade or so, astonishingly more quickly. A former colleague once showed me a medal that one of her predecessors, in the early 20th century, had been awarded by his constituents on the occasion – 25 years into his tenure – of his second ever visit to the constituency. Today, MPs are expected to be everywhere in their seats all the time, attending food banks (and posing for photographs with suitably serious expressions on their faces), attending parish council meetings, opening fetes, making speeches at school awards days, plus a hundred other commitments. And because of the tyranny of social media, each and every event must be photographed or videoed and posted immediately on Twitter or Instagram so that the small percentage of MPs’ constituents who actually use those platforms can see how hardworking they are.Long gone are the days when all an MP owed his constituents was “not only his industry but his judgment” in these post-Burkean times constituents are led, erroneously, to believe that their MP should answer every call, fix every problem, listen to every complaint, sympathise with every viewpoint, however contradictory, inspect every pothole, live full time in the constituency they represent and spend all their time both in the House of Commons and in the constituency.Modern MPs never dare contradict this absurd definition of their job, for fear of losing a vote here or there. The second jobs controversy gives them the opportunity to wax lyrical to the nation about how hardworking they are and how they simply can’t imagine how Cox or any other (Conservative) MP can possibly do this job while holding down a second one. The job, as now defined, does indeed take up a lot more time than it used to, thanks largely to the increased expectations engineered by MPs themselves. The notion that a constituent might be told “No”, or asked to go instead to speak to a local councillor who might have better connections to solve a particular issue is anathema to the new breed of Super Social Worker MPs.The truth, sadly, is that MPs have no executive authority and no budgets to make a difference in their communities. When they step outside their immediate areas of responsibility, those areas defined by the role of government in people’s lives, they achieve very little other than a higher local awareness of their presence: “Oh, we see our MP a lot round here.” Which is obviously politically useful. But MPs aren’t elected as public relations professionals whose effectiveness can be counted in the number of retweets they receive. They don’t receive £82,000 a year to promote their own political parties. They are there, primarily, to debate and to legislate in parliament, though even here the competition of ideas has now been replaced by a competition to see who can be outraged the loudest.The job of MP is unique and it has been shaped, through the years, by those who have held the post. The modern fad is to turn it into an opportunity to be a mini celebrity locally. The likes of Cox have chosen to treat it in a more traditional way. If constituents are happy, there really is no case to change either model. But I bet I know which is more enjoyable for the incumbent.More from News‘Don\u0026#39t take pills from Belarusian soldiers’: Poland fires texts to keep migrants at bayFrance to make Covid booster mandatory for over-65s to access public spacesMandatory coronavirus vaccines could cause mass exodus of healthcare workersNoisy tanks damaged my hearing, says head of armed forcesDublin preparing emergency plans for EU-UK trade warHermit of Treig: Highland recluse rejects doctors’ orders to return to civilisationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"england worst covid now must start planning future pandemics","story":"Now that the coronavirus epidemic in England is over, we can start to learn some lessons about what went well or badly over the course of the pandemic, to help us manage future pandemics when they come (which they surely will).Many people, in seeking to learn such lessons, will focus upon how things were done in our country compared with others, in an attempt to say we did this better or that worse. There will, however, be great difficulty in comparing ourselves to other countries until their epidemics are over as well - which may be some time yet.

And so on.As I see it, the single biggest lesson of the English epidemic - by a country mile the most important - is that vaccine development seems to be vastly more rapid than was considered even vaguely possible in previous pandemic plans. In Spring 2020 it was assumed that the shortest plausible time for a vaccine of any efficacy was 18 months (that was, for example, the minimum time assumed in the well-known Imperial College study of March 2020), and that the first vaccines that did arise would probably have similar efficacy to flu vaccines (blocking around 60 per cent of transmission).Another lesson of the crisis has been that, with modern technology, it has proven to be much more feasible to lock down our society, whilst most of the economy continues to function, than we had ever imagined before. But, even so, if it had indeed taken 18 months to develop even a moderate-efficacy vaccine, with regulatory approval and then roll-out on top of that (so, probably another couple of years) - the government\u0027s Suppression strategy of 2020 would have proved to have been an epic error that would have collapsed during the Second Wave in late 2020. Perhaps, if in a future pandemic we do end up seeking to Suppress for longer, another lesson would be that in the first Summer we need to embrace change much more aggressively – outdoor cinemas, outdoor dances, outdoor dining etc. (Though we may have permanently changed our society’s attitudes to some of those things now, anyway.)But it appears that, rather than it taking 18 months to develop a vaccine, we are now talking literally a matter of hours. Not even days: hours. That changes everything in terms of pandemic planning. If vaccines can be produced in future pandemics as rapidly as that, then heavily suppressing transmission for a short period whilst we wait for vaccines to be approved and distributed becomes a much more plausible strategy than ever seemed likely in the past.It also affects emergency authorisation procedures and timelines. Over 100,000 people died, in the UK, after the vaccines had already been produced but before any material number of people had received them. With the benefit of hindsight that seems scandalous. Of course one must have some procedures for testing vaccines and clearly the authorisation procedure was greatly expedited compared with authorisations in the past, but, even so, was it really better to wait so long, with so many people dying, rather than engage in even more streamlined procedures before rolling the vaccines out?Is it realistic to imagine that in future pandemics vaccines will come as quickly as they did for this coronavirus? That seems like the single most fundamental question we need to ask ourselves as we learn lessons from Covid. I don\u0027t know the answer. But someone will.We must be wary of fighting the last war, of course. Highly effective therapeutics are just now arriving. At the start of the pandemic it seemed plausible that therapeutics would arrive before vaccines did. Perhaps that will be what happens in a future pandemic and it would be a mistake to regard vaccines as the core strategy?The coronavirus epidemic in England was, as we all know, a grim business. Mercifully, it is now over and the time for learning lessons for future pandemics has begun. What I’ve sketched here is, I hope, just the start of that process.More from News‘Don\u0026#39t take pills from Belarusian soldiers’: Poland fires texts to keep migrants at bayFrance to make Covid booster mandatory for over-65s to access public spacesNoisy tanks damaged my hearing, says head of Armed ForcesMandatory coronavirus vaccines could cause mass exodus of healthcare workersDublin preparing emergency plans for EU-UK trade warHermit of Treig: Highland recluse rejects doctors’ orders to return to civilisationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pandemic wipes decade britains progress improving life expectancy","story":"Britain has lost a decade of progress on life expectancy during the pandemic, international research has shown.The report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) showed that across the world, coronavirus caused a 16 per cent rise in expected deaths.Life expectancy fell in 24 out of 30 countries, with Britain among the worst, according to data. Gains made since 2010 were wiped out in the UK, with life expectancy falling by a year, to 80.4 years.The US fared worst for loss in life expectancy, with 1.6 years of life lost.The figures show that across Europe, Britain has the second lowest number of hospital beds and doctors, compared with its population, with just 2.5 beds and three doctors per 1,000 people.

On Twitter, Malala spoke of her joy “for the journey ahead”. The couple were married at what was described as a “small ceremony” in Birmingham, which she made her home following the assassination attempt that catapulted her into the world’s consciousness.Nine years after being shot in the head and left for dead by a Taliban gunman, Malala wrote on social media: “Today marks a precious day in my life. Asser and I tied the knot to be partners for life. “We celebrated a small nikkah ceremony at home in Birmingham with our families. Please send us your prayers. We are excited to walk together for the journey ahead.”It is unclear how the couple met but they were first photographed together along with cricketers and dignitaries at Lord\u0027s cricket ground two years ago during the cricket world cup. They were then pictured together at Edgbaston a few days later at another match.  Their relationship had been kept secret from the wider world.Malala grew up in the Swat Valley in Pakistan and had already become a prominent campaigner for girls’ education when she was targeted by the Taliban. She was shot in the head in an attempted assassination as she travelled home from school and in the aftermath airlifted from one Pakistan hospital to another before being flown to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham for treatment. The Taliban issued a statement, declaring that if she survived they would target her again.Malala made Birmingham her new home and used it as a base to continue her campaigning. She wrote a best-selling book I Am Malala in 2013 and a year later was awarded the Nobel peace prize. She won a place at the University of Oxford to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics, graduating in 2020.In a recent interview with Vogue magazine, published in its July edition, Malala had been dismissive of the idea of marriage. “I still don’t understand why people have to get married,” she told the magazine, adding “If you want to have a person in your life, why do you have to sign marriage papers, why can’t it just be a partnership?”Malala told the interviewer that her mother had been scornful of her position.Her husband Asser Malik is general manager in the high performance department with the Pakistan Cricket Board. In the run up to the surprise wedding, he has been seemingly preoccupied on Twitter with the progress of the Pakistan cricket team which has reached the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup being played in the United Arab Emirates.The only clue to his burgeoning relationship with Malala is when he posted on Twitter in July a birthday message to his bride-to-be which read “Happy Birthday to the most amazing Malala” and with it a photograph of the couple standing side by side. Dignitaries last night began to send their messages of congratulation to the newlyweds.More from News‘Don\u0026#39t take pills from Belarusian soldiers’: Poland fires texts to keep migrants at bayFrance to make Covid booster mandatory for over-65s to access public spacesMandatory coronavirus vaccines could cause mass exodus of healthcare workersNoisy tanks damaged my hearing, says head of armed forcesDublin preparing emergency plans for EU-UK trade warHermit of Treig: Highland recluse rejects doctors’ orders to return to civilisationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"skys limit winners 2021 royal air force photographic competition","story":"The Royal Air Force Photographic Competition is always hotly contested and this year was no different. Nearly 1,500 images and more than 50 videos were submitted across the competition’s seven categories of Personnel, Current RAF Equipment, RAF Operations and Exercises, the Mallett Student Trophy, Section Portfolio, Video and “Peoples’ Choice”.Cpl Lee Matthews had a very successful competition winning three categories.

Image: AFP via Getty ImagesByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Nov | commentsCovid vaccination passports could be extended to include pubs in Scotland, the Deputy First Minister has suggested. John Swinney warned that Scotland was still in a “precarious and unpredictable” situation with regards to the virus with winter looming. He warned: “If the previous pattern, characterised by waves of infection, is repeated, there is a risk that the spread of the virus could, very quickly, increase again during the coming weeks, perhaps over the Christmas period.”With the NHS already under “intense pressure”, Mr Swinney said that “some scenarios for what may happen next are very concerning”, telling MSPs there was a “need to avoid the most dangerous of those scenarios”.He stressed that the Scottish Government wanted to avoid having to reimpose “the sort of strict lockdowns we had seen before most of us were vaccinated”.  But he insisted: “We do need to take appropriate measures to keep the pandemic under control. “It is because we want to avoid more dficult restrictions that we cannot rule out strengthening the baseline protective measures currently in place as the best way to head off any prospect of future lockdowns.” The Covid restrictions in place in Scotland will be reviewed again next week, Mr Swinney said. The coronavirus-gtcoronavirus certication scheme requires people going to nightclubs and to other large-scale events – such as concerts and some football matches – to be able to prove they have received two doses of vaccine. Other possible measures could see work being required to improve ventilation, steps to increase home working and “whether changes are needed to extend use of face coverings”. At the moment, no decisions had been made yet. The Government would be “discussing options with business sector organisations this week”. Mr Swinney was giving the regular coronavirus update to MSPs in place of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who was at the Cop climate change summit in Glasgow.  He told the Parliament that there were “some specic reasons to suspect that case numbers may increase in the weeks ahead”.The Deputy First Minister said: “With the onset of colder winter weather, increased time spent indoors means there will likely be more opportunities for Covid to circulate.“Cop has seen people from all over the world meeting in Glasgow – and that presents a known infection risk. “And many of us will wish to spend time visiting loved ones over the festive period.” Comment MORE ON Scottish GovernmentJohn SwinneyPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

MPs voted  to , majority , to approve a Government concession which aims to cut the dumping of raw sewage into waterways. The Government said its amendment to the Environment Bill will legally require water firms to make a “progressive reduction” in dumping raw sewage into waterways. Environment Minister Rebecca Pow warned water companies she will be “watching” their progress on sewage discharges “very closely”. But campaigners have said it doesnapost go far enough.  Shadow Environment Secretary Luke Pollard said the Government had been “shamed” into a U-turn on sewage but added the amendment did not go far enough. Mr Pollard said: “The amendment the minister has cited in lieu of the Duke of Wellington amendment is confined to storm overflows and not the sewage system as a whole. “There’s no specic duty on Ofwat or the Environment Agency to ensure compliance – and there should be – and we need to have a focus on reduction on harm rather than adverse impacts. This looks like looking busy without making a real dference.” Tories Philip Dunne and Neil Parish rebelled against the government in the last vote, but supported ministers on Monday.  Surfers Against Sewage said after the vote: “We’re hugely disappointed that the government has decided not to back the tougher Duke of Wellington amendment, which would have given them greater powers in tackling the sewage pollution emergency in our rivers and ocean. “Just last week, UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned world leaders at Cop to stop treating nature “like a toilet”.The government has failed to fully seize the opportunity in the most urgent of environmental decades to make an example of water companies to say, ‘If you pollute, you fix it, you pay.’ The vote comes after Peers backed a bid by the Duke of Wellington to compel firms to improve their sewage systems “as soon as reasonable”.  Ministers were forced into a climbdown in a row over levels of raw sewage being dumped into rivers and seas. Environment Secretary George Eustice said a new legal duty would be imposed on water companies to progressively reduce the amount of sewage pumped into waterways from storm overflows. Martin Salter, of the Angling Trust, said this new amendment did not go far enough.“At a time when public trust in politicians has once again been shaken, we hope MPs will stand firm, and insist on clarity and action by ministers to create a pathway out of pollution.” Comment MORE ON Politics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Department of Health and Social Care accepted there may be a “signicant” hit to the health service workforce as millions are told ‘no jab, no job’.Ministers today announced patient-facing healthcare staff in England will need to have had both doses of vaccine by April , unless they have a medical exemption, as a condition of deployment.That includes doctors, nurses and dentists as well as cleaners, porters, ward clerks and receptionists. Private healthcare, unpaid volunteers, agency staff and trainees are all included.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the scales clearly tip to one side for mandatory jabs - due to our imperative to protect the NHS and those services upon which we all rely.But a government impact statement has now estimated , health and care staff could refuse to be vaccinated under the policy, without having a medical exemption.  That includes , staff in the NHS in England in a central scenario - .% of the workforce. It also includes , in private healthcare . And it includes , in social care , where jabs will become mandatory this Thursday. Once natural wastage is included the government estimates this figure at more like ,. The documents do not make clear whether all , staff would be working on the frontline currently. It appears possible that some are already in back office roles. Itaposs thought patient-facing staff who refuse to be jabbed will face being reassigned to back office roles or losing their jobs completely. The impact statement confirmed hospitals will have to pay for “recruiting replacements for workers who may not fulfil the requirement of having both doses of the vaccine”. This in turn could cause “potential disruption to health and care services”.  The impact statement warned there was a wide range of possibilities of how many health and care staff will get vaccinated in response to the scheme - anywhere from , to ,.It said there is signicant uncertainty about the final number of staff affected. However, it added: The impact on workforce levels and health and care services could be signicant. If a proportion of staff decides to leave the NHS, this would put pressure on NHS services. This is likely to be more acute in clinical staff groups where there are existing staff shortages and lags in labour supply caused by education and training requirements, but all services are likely to be impacted.It comes after unions and Labour warned of possible staff shortages.UNISON today warned some care homes could be forced to shut their doors and others will struggle to meet safe staffing levels.  On the NHS changes, UNISON head of health Sara Gorton added: This wasn’t something the government needed to do. “The effective and supportive approach taken by NHS trusts has persuaded the overwhelming majority of health staff to have both Covid shots. “Now this sledgehammer policy risks doing more harm than good. “Without knowing what proportion of staff are covered by exemptions, creating a new law seems extreme. “It will move effort and attention away from caring for Covid patients and clearing the backlog created by the pandemic.” Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth warned ministers to “proceed with caution”, adding: We simply cannot afford to lose thousands of NHS staff overnight. Some MPs sounded caution over the move - but others said it should have happened quicker. Tory MP Dr Andrew Murrison said: “If this has to be done, then it is better to do it quickly, and by the Spring, clearly we’re going to be past the winter pressures we’re all concerned about.” Mr Javid warned it cannot be business as usual when it comes to vaccination, adding: The first duty of everyone working in health and social care is to avoid preventable harm to the people they care for. “Not only that, they have a responsibility to do all they can to keep each other safe.” But Rachel Harrison of the GMB union warned: Bulldozing this vaccine will exacerbate the already crushing staffing crisis we face across the NHS and ambulance services. Both are operating under extreme pressures, after a decade of austerity and cuts, with an exhausted and demoralised workforce who are fearful of what is to come as we head through winter. Staff are already leaving their employment and this will certainly force many more to go. Royal College of Nursing General Secretary Pat Cullen added: The vast majority of NHS nursing staff received the COVID- vaccine as soon as it was offered, having led the vaccination roll out across the UK and continuing to do so with the booster programme. “With the five months until this decision takes effect, the government and employers must continue to engage with the small minority who have chosen not to have the vaccine. “This is vital to understanding their concerns, supporting them to understand the importance of the vaccine and to make that important choice.

There is no cap on what MPs can earn on top of their parliamentary salary - which starts at £, excluding expenses and other perks - provided that all income is declared in official registers and no work relates to lobbying parliament. But this rule is controversial - with some politicians and campaign groups arguing MPs shouldn’t be allowed to take on any other paid work. We analysed the Commons register of financial interests to see which ten MPs have declared the largest earnings from the private sector since the  election. . Theresa May- £.m Unlike her predecessor David Cameron, the former Prime Minister refused to give up her Maidenhead seat when she was forced out of office in July .She signed to the prestigious Washington Speakers Bureau later that year and, on average, she declares  times as much a year from talks as she earns as a backbencher. In February , she was paid £, to speak to a women’s forum founded by the Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum despite ongoing international concern about the UAEaposs human rights record. During her visit, May was pictured shaking the hand of Al Maktoum, who has been accused of kidnapping his daughters and abusing his estranged we. And the pandemic didnapost put a stop to her lucrative speaking gigs - during lockdown she was charging around £, for speeches delivered on Zoom.Mrs Mayaposs speaking earnings are paid to the Office of Theresa May Ltd.On the register of interests, she declares: These sums are used to pay employees, maintain my ongoing involvement in public le and support my charitable work. The Office of Theresa May has paid the former Prime Minister a salary of £, a year since September last year. . Sir Geoffrey Cox- £m  Former attorney general Sir Geoffrey Cox has made a fortune working as a barrister while representing Torridge and West Devon in parliament. And heaposs no stranger to controversy over his huge earnings. In , he resigned from the House of Commons standards committee when it was revealed he failed to meet the deadline for declaring £, he’d been paid for legal work. The committee found he had committed a serious breach of parliamentary rules but accepted it was not intentional and he made a public apology. In the same year, he unsuccessfully tried to claim p for a pint of milk on Commons expenses but this was rejected by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. In response, he said: “In collating the office expenses for me to sign off, my staff had failed to notice that the rules had changed in May so as to place these costs outside the scope of IPSA’s scheme. “Once the error was identied, it was ed by Ipsa and immediately cancelled by my office.” He gave up practising law temporarily when he was appointed attorney general in , but has made more than a million since leaving the cabinet and resuming legal work in February . . Sir John Redwood- £k  Sir John Redwood, a former Tory leadership candidate and secretary of state for Wales, has several roles with private investment firms. The bulk of the Wokingham MP’s earnings come from his role as chairman of the investment committee of Charles Stanley - which has netted him £, per month since the last election. The firm also pays him bonuses on occasion. Despite his wealth, he once charged the taxpayer £ for reseeding the lawn at his constituency home in Berkshire. He was ordered to pay the money back - and moaned that the decision was unfair because he felt it was an honest and accurate claim. . Fiona Bruce- £k  Lawyer Fiona Bruce is the Prime Ministeraposs envoy on the human right to freedom of religion or belief. The Congleton MP has continued to work for her own Cheshire based firm, Fiona Bruce and Co LLP, since being elected in . Ms Bruce said the four largest of the  payments she listed were “almost entirely tax payments not receipts by me” but “for technical reasons have to be declared.” . Andrew Mitchell- £k  Former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell makes a tidy sum from private investment companies while representing Sutton Coldfield in parliament. This includes SouthBridge, an African investment bank based which pays him £, a year for just nine days’ work. Yet in the past some of his expense claims have raised eyebrows. When thebroke the story of the MPs’ expenses scandal in , it was revealed heaposd claimed £, for cleaning, decorating and gardening - even billing the public purse for a duvet stuffed with goose down. He told the paper he’d acted within the rules, insisting the sum claimed was “less than the cost that I have incurred maintaining my second home and is less than the amount I would have been entitled to claim. . Sajid Javid- £k The Bromsgrove MP resigned as chancellor in February  following an explosive bust up with Boris Johnsonaposs former top aide Dominic Cummings.But just months after leaving office, he was handed two roles with a combined annual salary of over £,. In August last year, he began a £, a year role with bank JP Morgan. Due to the fact heaposd served in the cabinet within the last two years, he had to consult the governmentaposs Advisory Committee on Business Appointments about his roles. The committee warned Javidaposs privileged access to information as chancellor meant accepting a job with JP Morgan carried potential risks but ultimately allowed the appointment to go ahead. Two months later, he signed up for a role with software firm C.ai, paying an annual salary of £,. He also consulted the committee about this role. In addition, he made money from speeches. He quit both JP Morgan and C.ai after less than a year, ing to the cabinet in June to replace Matt Hancock as health secretary. . Richard Fuller- £k Mr Fuller represented Bedford from  to , when he lost his seat to Labour, and took up a role as chief executive of software company Impero Solutions.He ed to parliament in  to represent North East Bedfordshire and quit his post with the company. Impero gave him a severance payment of £, at the end of March  - but allowed him to continue as an advisory director, paying £, a year for just two hours work a month. He also has a string of roles advising other firms, in the fields of software, security and venture capitalism. . Owen Paterson- £k  The MP at the centre of the furore made his money as a consultant to Randox and Lynnaposs Country Foods, netting him north of £, a year on top of his backbench salary. The former environment secretary refused to accept the standards committeeaposs findings that he had lobbied on behalf of both companies, in contravention of the rules. A government bid to reform the standards process - which would have allowed him to appeal - backfired. He resigned this week in the wake of the controversy, a decision which will trigger a by-election in his North Shropshire constituency. . Sir John Hayes- £k  The South Holland and the Deepings MP served in a range of ministerial posts under both Theresa May and David Cameron. Since leaving government in , he’s made money in a number of dferent ways. He has a lucrative contract as an advisor to oil company BB Energy paying £, a year. He also delivers lectures on political studies. . Nadine Dorries- £k  Culture secretary Nadine Dorries makes her money writing books on the side - mainly based in her home city of Liverpool - and has sold over . million to date. Sheaposs written  titles in total and regularly receives royalty payments, as well as advances for new work. Her first book was published in  - nine years after her election to parliament.

Court records show that HMRC has filed a petition for bankruptcy against Conservative MP Adam Afriyie, according to . Mr Afriyie, who was once regarded as a Tory rising star, has been embroiled in a dispute for several years over his past business interests, his office confirmed. Being subject to bankruptcy proceedings does not immediately force an MP to stand down under Parliamentaposs rules.But anyone who is made bankrupt and made subject to a bankruptcy restrictions order can be disqualied from election to and sitting in Parliament, potentially triggering a by-election. These orders can be imposedthe person who is bankrupt refuses to cooperate or behaves fraudulently. The Tories are already facing three by-elections, including in North Shropshire after shamed MP Owen Paterson quit following a lobbying row. A potential fourth by-election could be on the cards in Leicester East in the wake of ex-Labour MP Claudia Webbeaposs harassment conviction. She has launched a bid to overturn her sentence and the conviction, with her appeal due to be heard in March.A spokesperson for Mr Afriyie said:The petition arises for complex reasons related to Adamaposs past business interests.Negotiations have been ongoing for several years and the petition is subject to legal challenge as his advisers are working towards reaching an agreement.Mr Afriyie said: I will of course pay any tax that is due.He was first reported to be facing potential bankrupcty proceedings before the  general election.Mr Afriyie set up IT firm Connect Support Services in  but the firm went into insolvency in . Connect Support Services is reportedly the lead creditor in Mr Afriyie’s bankruptcy case. It comes after the Sunday Mirror revealed in  that Mr Afriyieaposs £.million mansion was being rented out for £, a night on Airbnb. Parliamentaposs rules require MPs to declare property worth more than £, or rental income of more than £, a year. At the time he said: “There’s no requirement to declare my private homes in the register of members interests, because I have never claimed Parliamentary expenses for them nor received rental income from them.” He said that he would ask Parliament’s registrar for advice and update the registerhe had made any mistakes. Mr Afriyie then updated the register of interests in January  to include an entry for occasional income derived from short lets of my Windsor home and from using the grounds for events. He said the income was paid to a family member.

But when his symptoms got worse, the family received some terrible newsAt first, the issues were dismissed as just reflux Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByJessica TaylorReal le features writer:,  Nov | commentsWhen Jill Ferrariaposs -week-old son, Huey, started snoring at night, she thought little of it. Heaposd so far been a healthy baby, born at full term with no complications, and seemed perfectly fine. But as the weeks passed, Jill, from Sydney in Australia, began to notice her baby boy was becoming more and more unsettled - and she realised something was going on. Speaking to news.au, the mum said: “I went and saw numerous dferent doctors, went to a community health nurse, and they all said it was just normal, newborn behaviour and unsettledness. She added other doctors had suggested Huey was just suffering from reflux.Jill noticed that, as well as being unsettled, Huey was also a noisy breather and tended to breathe through his mouth. She added he wassnoring quite a lot.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Jill said Huey would fall asleep during the day and wake up making high-pitched squeals, which she took as an indication that something wasnapost right. When she realised Huey also wasnapost gaining weight, Jill managed to get her son referred to a paediatrician. She recalls that, after taking a look at her son, the doctor started getting a little bit flustered. After measuring Hueyaposs abdomen and neck, Jill said the doctor gave her some devastating news. She recalled him saying: I’m really sorry, but I think your baby’s got cancer. “We were flabbergasted. We just thought he had severe reflux and we needed some better medication or something,” Jill said.  She added that, until that point, sheaposd been given no indication it could have been so severe. The family was sent to Sydney Childrenaposs Hospital immediately. On the way there, Jill recalls being in complete shock. “It is a little bit of a blur. A lot of things happened quickly [when we arrived at the hospital], and that’s when you know that things are serious. When the hospital moves exceptionally fast, that means they’re worried,” she said. A biopsy confirmed the awful diagnosis - Huey had stage four S neuroblastoma. He had an inoperable tumour measuring cm on his neck and cancer in his liver which had caused it to swell. Hueyaposs only treatment option was to have eight rounds of chemotherapy over the next seven months.  After his chemotherapy had ended, Huey still had signs of cancer within his liver and around his carotid artery. But, miraculously, Huey continued to recover after the chemotherapy and the cancer cells depleted. Now, Jill says the cancer cells appear to have gone completely. Huey is now four-and-a-half years old and thriving. Jill describes her son as the light of my le. Despite being a happy and healthy boy, he lives with the after-effects of having chemotherapy so young, and has a speech delay. Arguing for newer, more targeted treatment options for children with neuroblastoma Jill said her sonaposs speech delay is getting much better, but he still has some way to go. The family is working with the Childrenaposs Cancer Institute in Australia, which is researching more targeted treatments so young kids arenapost given such intense chemotherapy.Do you have a real le story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcNow, Jill is raising money to fund research that will improve treatment for neuroblastoma in children - aiming to help future kids diagnosed with the condition and give them a better chance.

Residents near the junction in East London woke up to a loud bang at .am on Sunday. To their horror, they saw the crumpled car outside their window. It is thought the car swerved to avoid oncoming traffic but didnapost quite make the turn. Two people who were inside the car got out, took a look at the front of the car, took a child out from the backseat and then bizarrely walked off. They appeared to be miraculously uninjured as the horrying scenes were caught on a residentaposs home security system.  The camera was pointed at the traffic bollard at the junction of Leyton Green Road and Lea Bridge Road in Leyton. One man and his we were woken by a thunderous bang on Sunday morning. When they saw the crash, they phoned the police and ambulance. By the time authorities arrived the occupants of the silver car had vanished. Footage shows the vehicle swerving to avoid an oncoming back car, and careering into a no through road.  It takes out a road sign and then gets stuck on a bollard. The driver revs the engine, trying to move it, but the car is well and truly stuck. Two people then get out and remove a child from the back seat. Meanwhile, a motorist in a black car parks up to check on the driver and passengers, and when the driver sees the two people walking around their car, he walks off.  A witness said: It looks like they have seen the oncoming cars, and ended up in the cycle lane. The car was embedded on the bollard. They didnapost actually stop for the police or ambulance. It woke me and my we up. I called the emergency services and they were there in a few minutes, but the guys had walked off. There was a minor in the car that can be seen in the video. And he added: There have been more accidents which have taken place in the last few years at that junction. A spokeswoman for the Met Police said: Police were called to Lea Bridge Road, E, shortly after .hrs on Sunday,  November to reports of a road traffic collision. Officers attended. A BMW car was found to have collided with a lamppost and a bollard. The occupants of the vehicle, including a child, had left the scene before police arrived.

The white and black model , which has a top speed of mph, crashed on the Hams Way road on the A near Worcester at .pm on Sunday. Drivers could only watch in horror as the luxury vehicle roared across two lanes before colliding with another car and coming to rest on a grass verge on the A, near Worcester. Police, ambulance and fire crews rushed to the scene of the crash and transported two people to hospital. A woman who was walking on a footbridge at the time of the crash told of how she saw the Ferrari heading from the Powick direction swerving across the carriageway. I heard the engine roar and my husband estimated it was going at least mph,” she said. The driver narrowly missed one car but the second car, a white hatchback, couldnapost avoid him and they collided. They both ended up on the grass verge. People stopped and got out of their car to check the drivers were both OK.” The witness said the driver of the Ferrari appeared stuck for a while, before he was helped into an ambulance.  It was a scary one - I just hope everyone was alright and not seriously hurt,” she said. The road was closed for nearly an hour while the debris was cleared from the carriageway. A spokesperson for West Midlands Ambulance Service said they were called upon shortly before .pm on Sunday, to reports of a road traffic collision involving two cars on the A in Worcester. We sent one ambulance and the Midlands Air Ambulance critical care car to the scene,” they said. On arrival, crews found two patients at the scene. Both were treated for injuries not believed to be serious and conveyed to hospital for further treatment.

It isn’t any old takeaway, as all the food served is plant-based and vegan. The Levenshulme business, JJ’s Vish and Chips, which opened its doors earlier this month, aims to be a plant-based offering for both vegans and meat eaters who want to try something new. It offers vegan fish and chips, as well as vegan bratwurst, sausage and nuggets, so no-one has to feel left out when they’re looking for a takeaway. JJ’s Vish and Chips began serving Manchester in February as a takeaway business, with plans to open a shop when the time was right. Owner Jess Jones, , from Leeds,told our sister site Chill: “It was about two and a half, nearly three years ago now, I was at a fish and chip shop in Leeds, my hometown, and just wanted a takeaway.“I was vegetarian at the time and realised I couldn’t get anything that was vegetarian and a chippy tea. “There were all these sort of things that were coming out like vegan burgers and junk food you could get, but there didn’t seem to be any fish and chip shop replicas.” With that in mind, Ms Jones decided to go out and create her own version of fish and chips that vegetarians and vegans could enjoy.Wondering where to eat, drink or visit for your next UK holiday  At Chill we help you decide where to go and stay next with hundreds of recommendations right on your doorstep.

For the latest must-have travel news follow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. She said: “It was just a case of me feeling like I was missing out and I came up with this mad idea.” Ms Jones uses banana blossom to make the vish which is then shaped into fish-shaped patties, marinated in fishy flavours, battered and fried. It took a bit of experimentation to decide on this recipe, but Ms Jones was armed with some culinary knowledge when she first embarked on the venture.  Ms Jones said: “I worked in hospitality for many years and I’ve worked in kitchens, so I enjoy cooking a lot. “So to come up with the recipe it was a mix of my knowledge from working in kitchens, trying things at home, reading online and trial and error really.” Ms Jones opened her first shop in Leeds in  and has received a lot of support from Mancunians since the opening of her new site. She said: “The reaction has been brilliant, since opening our Manchester site it’s been absolutely mental. “We’ve had lots of excited people in the shop and nice stuff online. It’s really nice and positive so far.” Many people choose to eat plant-based food, claiming a vegan or vegetarian diet can help to protect the planet.  Some people are reluctant to make the switch because they don’t want to give up their favourite dishes that contain meat or fish. At JJ’s Vish and Chips, vegans and non-vegans alike enjoy the plant-based recreation of the fish and chips which is important to Ms Jones, as she wants everyone to enjoy her food. She said: “I’ve read a few comments online that have said, ‘Iaposm a meat eater and I can confirm it’s nice’. “I think because there’s been quite a lot of hype it might have encouraged people who might not have tried before to just give it a go which is really important. “I don’t want to just cater to vegans and veggies, I want to cater to everyone and anyone. “If someone can come to the shop and have my chippy tea over a fish chippy tea every now and again then I feel like that’s me doing my bit for the planet.” Comment MORE ON ChillFoodFast foodJunk food\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Fancy an escape to the Chill newsletter for weekly inspiration and advice on UK holidays Sign Up!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Paul Deery spent three nights at the Royal Albion Hotel in Brighton last month, but claims his horrendousapos room had an unmade bed, tobacco left on the table and pubic hair left in the bath. The -year-old had book to stay with his friend, Paul Mallon, , and paid £ for their stay. But they say the manager of the three star hotel only offered a % refund for their stay. Have you stayed at the hotel  Let us know about your visit, email webnews@mirror  When he doubled down, Paul was given a final offer of a % discount on his next visit to the hotel - which Paul deemed aposcheekyapos as he wanted a full refund and didnapost want to negotiate, norto the venue. Both Paul and Paul were so disgusted by their stay they felt compelled to take COVID tests - which came back negative. Which  magazine slammed the hotel as one of the worst hotels weaposve ever inspected in  and relisted it as such in , condemning the venue with . out of  stars for cleanliness and the same on food. Their brutal review told holidaymakers to avoid at all costs and said the regency-style hotel makes Fawlty Towers look like the Ritz. Paul, a recruitment business boss, said: It was on the seafront, it was like £ for three nights, so it wasnapost cheap. So we get to the room and itaposs cold and damp. My friendaposs bed wasnapost made so it was pretty obvious that it hadnapost been cleaned beforehand. Thataposd be bad enough, but during Covid times, itaposs unacceptable. Especially when on their website, they guarantee all rooms are following Covid regulations and have regular housekeeping. There was blood and urine stains on my friendaposs mattress. My friend actually hadnapost noticed the stains at first, because they were underneath the top sheet. The sheet came up a bit and thataposs when we saw it. There was what I can only gather to be pubic hair in the bath. There were tobacco remains on the table. The whole thing was horric really.  Me and my friend went down to see the manager, but he wasnapost available. We left a message and were told that somebody would be in touch with us, but it didnapost happen. Because we were there for a mini-break, I didnapost want to spend all my time that weekend trying to chase down the manager. We had no other alternatives, everywhere  we checked was booked up so we had no choice but to stay there. We would have moved, but there were no other hotels available. Plus we couldnapost get a hold of the manager so we were in a bit of a stalemate. They said there was daily housekeeping, but our room wasnapost cleaned once. Me and my friend took Covid tests after our stay, just in case. Tests came back fine, thankfully. Paul took the issue further and emailed the hotelaposs manager, hoping to get a full refund. Paul said: When I emailed the manager, he came back saying aposThis isnapost part of our usual high standard, weaposll make sure this never happens againapos, and offered us a % refund, which would have worked out at about £. I was a bit insulted by that, and I emailed back saying aposThataposs not good enoughapos. Then he came back with an email titled aposFinal offerapos, which I thought was a bit cheeky, aswe were in some sort of negotiation. He once again offered the same % refund, and % offwe were to stay again. I sent an email back saying aposI wonapost be staying at the hotel again, so the % doesnapost apply. I want a full refund.apos I didnapost hear from him after that.  Itaposs a bit insulting that weaposre just being ignored. The whole experience was horrible. Iaposm into complaining normally, but this was just horrendous. It wasnapost something silly like a crack in the window, this was blood and urine stains. We didnapost spend too much time in the hotel over the weekend for obvious reasons. Itaposs completely unacceptable, especially for the price I paid. The Britannia website boasts that the -room Royal Albion is aposone of the most popularapos in Brighton and claims it aposoffers character and style in a premier positionapos while being aposproud of its reputation as a family hotelapos. Britannia Hotels have been contacted for comment. After being contacted for comment, the Royal Albion confirmed that the matter had been apossettledapos and Paul would be receiving a refund.

Sarah Moulds, , was filmed apparently kicking and punching a distressed horse in the street.A clip shared on social media by anti-hunting campaign group Hertfordshire Hunt Saboteurs shows her being aggressive towards the animal after it ran into a road. The sickening footage quickly caused outrage on social media, with people calling on the RSPCA - the largest animal welfare charity in the UK - to launch an investigation. Today, it has been reported that Ms Moulds is a married teacher and mum who works at Somerby Primary School and is also a director of the Knossington  Somerby Pre-School in Leicestershire. The Daily Star reports that Moulds was listed as a team manager for the local Cottesmore Pony Club but has since been removed from the website following the allegations.The Pony Club has now confirmed that Moulds was never a member and has been removed from her voluntary position.  A spokesperson for the Pony Club said: We are aware of the video circulating showing unacceptable treatment of a pony and we wholeheartedly condemn this behaviour. The welfare of horses and ponies is of the utmost importance to The Pony Club, therefore the lady in question has been removed from her voluntary position as a team organiser for a branch.  The Pony Club is a youth membership organisation and as such, she is not a member of The Pony Club. Cottesmore Hunt, who Moulds is believed to be part of, yesterday told The Mirror: The Chairman and Masters want to make it quite clear that they strongly disapprove of any such actions and assure you that they take a matter such as this very seriously and will deal with it in an appropriate manner.  The Hunting Office also criticised the footage, saying in a statement: The Hunting Office expects the highest level of animal welfare at all times - both on and off the hunting field - and condemns the actions taken by this inidual, who is not a member of the hunting associations. The RSPCA did not confirm the identity of the hunt rider but said in a statement: This footage is really upsetting.  We will always look into complaints made to us about animal welfare. We would urge anyone with first hand information about this incident to contact us on   . Knossington  Somerby Pre-School in Leicestershire declined to comment on the story. The Mirror has contacted Somerby Primary School for comment.

The emergency inspection of the house found the resident living alongside a large infestation of rats with no electricity, heating or water. The property was also in such a serious state of disrepair that it could have collapsed at any moment, Nottinghamshire Live reports.Concerned council officers moved the elderly resident into a local care home due to his ill health.  John Wilmott, cabinet member for licensing at Ashfield District Council, said: The owner of the property was vulnerable and living in an awful condition that could have ended his le. The amount of filth in the property was unimaginable, it was truly unbelievable that someone could live that way, but thanks to the work of our officers, he never has to live like that again. The council is committed to supporting vulnerable residents and utilising all available resources to ensure the empty and dangerous homes are made safe and reoccupied.  The environmental health team helped the owner sell his house at auction which has now been renovated into a family home. Last month a frustrated landlord spoke of his experiences with nightmare tenants who left his properties in squalid conditions. The man has been renting out houses for  years and despite building up a successful business, he constantly has to deal with tenants who wreck his homes and live in filth.  The homeowner, who has houses in Grimsby and Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, said he once saw a baby crawl through dog poo in one of their flats.On another occasion, he visited a house and found a lawnmower in the living room, Grimsby Live reports.The landlord said he is now on his tenth eviction, which has taken a financial toll on his family. For this reason, they have decided to start selling their houses instead of renting them.

Ken Smith, , has shunned traditional le since he was  after being attacked on a night out and left unconscious for  days with a brain haemorrhage. Doctors told him he would never be able to speak or walk again, but wanting to prove them wrong and having struck up an interest in wilderness living, Ken travelled to Canada.  While there he says he wondered what what happenhe just exited off the highway and went into nowhere, so he decided to find out - walking , miles on his own before ing home to Derbyshire. But when he got back his world was turned upside down after finding out both his parents had died while he was away. In his grief Ken walked theof Britain before reaching Rannoch in the Highlands.He told a BBC documentary: I cried all the way while walking. I thought where is the most isolated place in Britain I went around and followed every bay and every Ben where there wasnapost a house built.  Hundreds and hundreds of miles of nothingness. I looked across the loch and saw this woodland. In that stretch of wilderness- a full two hours walk from the nearest road - Ken knew heaposd found his new home. Ken built his own cabin from scratch after experimenting with dferent designs using sticks, and for the last  years that has been his haven from everyday le.All these years later the building does have a roaring log fire, but no running water or electricity, the BBC reports.  To feed himself Ken forages in the forest and and grows vegetables, but his main source of food comes from the loch after he taught himself to fish. His days are spent quietly living alongside the loch, and for the past two years he has allowed BBC documentary maker Lizzie McKenzie to film him at his home. But tragedy struck just days after the documentary director Lizzie left Ken, as he suffered a stroke while in the snow in February . He was able to call for help with an GPS personal locator beacon he had been given just prior to the stroke, which in turn sent a signal to Houston, Texas, where operators informed the Coastguard in the UK.  He was rushed to a hospital in Fort William where he spent seven weeks recovering, but despite doctors insistence he shouldto civilisation, Ken refused, just wanting toto his home. A year after his stroke, Ken was injured again after a log pile fell on him and had to once again be airlted to hospital. But in the months after his stroke Ken has been more open to receiving help, and the head stalker of the estate Ken lives on will bring him food every few weeks, paid for out of Kenaposs pension. Aware he is not getting any younger, Ken admits he is no worried about future, and wants to spend his final days at the cabin.

The -year-old, who is currently living in her  million mansion in Calornia having stepped back from the royal family, spoke about womenaposs opportunities at work for the aposMinding the Gapapos event. She made the case alongside Mellody Hobson, President of Ariel Investments and the chairwoman of Starbucks Corporation. At one point the mum-of-two turned her attention to social media, suggesting that the current set up encouraged negative debate. The Duchess highlighted the fact that Instagram has a like button and ability to comment, but not a aposdislikeapos option.  As a consequence, people either express their approval by hitting aposlikeapos, or explain their negative feelings in the comments. A aposdislikeapos button would lead to less negative, angry comments, Meghan said. One of the things that seems like such an easy solve from my lens,you look at Instagram for example, thereaposs a like button and then thereaposs comments, she said. Soyou disagree with something you have to comment on it in a really vitriolic way. If there was a dislike button wouldnapost that hugely sht what you were putting out there, because you could just like it or just dislike it. Now you have to like it or say something negative. It is just adding to this really unfortunate cycle that I think is having an unfortunate effect on women across the world. The online session tackled the question: How can women reach economic and professional parity   The Duchess argued that pushing for paid parity between the sexes was a positive thing both for workers and for companies, while also renewing her calls for paid sick and parental leave in the US. Earlier this month, the Duchess penned an impassioned plea to senior congress members on the topic. In the letter, she argued that a national paid-leave mandate would not only help inidual families, but the country as a whole.  In taking care of your child, you take care of your community, and you take care of your country—because when paid leave is a right, we’re creating a foundation that helps address mental health outcomes, health care costs, and economic strength at the starting line, Meghan wrote. Paid leave should be a national right, rather than a patchwork option limited to those whose employers have policies in place, or those who live in one of the few states where a leave program exists. … This is about putting families above politics. When she was asked about advocating for the change during the summit this evening, Meghan said she was not involving herself in politics as she considered the issue a cross-party, humanitarian one. The Duchess went on to relate the issue of womenaposs rights in the workplace to her own experience as a child. She spoke about how her experience attempting to save and make money when she was younger has taught her lessons that remain with her today, despite her now sizeable wealth. When she admitted being an avid couponer in her younger years, Meghan was asked whether she keeps up the practice today. Do they have coupons anymore, I donapost know. I will never buy something online without finding an online promo code first, the Duchess said, arguing that values learned as a child can stay with a person for le.  If that was engrained with me when I was young, imagine what the world would be likeyou ingrained other elements of financial understanding, especially in young women, so they could move in the world in a dferent way. Meghan went on to tell how she used to make scrunchies out of scraps of fabric to sell as a child. It was that feeling, I had done something myself, she said of the sensation sheaposd get after selling some of her crafts. You get not just purpose, but a sense of self satisfaction.

Wenjing Lin, , was murdered by Chun Xu, , at the takeaway in Ynyswen, Rhondda Cynon Taf, where she lived in with her mother, Meang Xu, and stepfather Yongquan Jiang.Xu had admitted manslaughter but denied murder, but was found guilty of the murder of Miss Linn and the attempted murder of Mr Jiang. Ms Xu has described the horrendous moment she found Miss Lin shortly after the killing on March . She told the court: The moment I saw her face had gone black and pale. I went to hug her and her body was cold. I could see her neck was black as she had been strangled.  Speaking outside the court with the support of her husband, Ms Xu said her daughter had passed all her GCSEaposs with As but died before getting the results. She said: My beautul daughter is gone and I can never forgive you. I have lost my beloved daughter, my everything. Everything of me. She cared for my husband and I very much. She has been helping us to communicate with all the English speakers.school friends miss her so much, I know they are suffering from the pain and loss of their best friend. They will never recover from it. Before that horrible day she was a very, very happy girl. She loved spending time with her friends and she enjoyed school.  Weaposve been to the school to speak to them. My daughter has passed all her GCSEaposs with As but she will never know her results that she has worked so hard for. Iaposm so proud of her achievements in the school. She loved school so much and her teachers called her the model student. Iaposm still not able to comprehend why the perpetrator would do this to her. Our lives have been turned upside down. I was crying every day, watching videos every day and trying to feel close to her and listen to her voice. I cannot imagine what my le is like without her. She was my only child. The perpetrator has broken our family. I had to begin counselling to help me but it will never take away the pain the perpetrator has caused us.  Miss Lin was described as an exceptional student by her teacher Rhiannon Davies who had a statement read to the court during the trial. Ms Davies, who taught Wenjingaposs when she was in year  at Treorchy Comprehensive School, said she was hardworking student. Even on the day of her death I was made aware she had logged in for a maths lesson early in the morning, Ms Davies added. She was a fantastic student and is sorely missed. The trial heard how Xu was a heavy gambler and owed the family £,. Michael Jones QC, prosecuting, told the court Xu visited the family armed with a kitchen kne, and an hour before the attacks had Googled can fingerprints be destroyed by fire.  When he was later questioned by a psychologist about his fitness to be questioned by police, he said: I didnapost mean to hurt the little girl. I wanted revenge on her mother. She upset me on many times and didnapost listen to what I say. Xu, also known as Little Gang, was regarded as a nephew to the mother, Ms Xu, as their parents had lived next door to each other in China, but they were not blood relations, Mr Jones said. In December , the family entrusted Xu with £, that he said he would send back to China for them to pay a friend who had loaned them money to start their business in the UK. However, Xu only sent some of the money back and gambled away £,, which he had then begun paying back. On March , , he rang Ms Xu and askedhe could come to see them, but told her not to tell anyone about his visit. That night they ate food together and everyone went to bed. The next morning, Mr Jones said, he strangled to death -year-old Wenjing. An hour before the attack he is said to have Googled dferent iations of whether finger prints on kne will still existburnt by fire. After killing Wenjing, Xu is said to have lured her stepfather, Mr Jiang, into the basement by asking whether he could have a piece of fish from the freezer. In the basement, Xu began attacking Mr Jiang with two knives, stabbing him in the neck and body.  When Mr Jiang asked Xu why he was attacking him, Xu replied: Money, money, money. Ms Xu then came down the basement stairs and saw the two fighting. She tried to ring a friend, and Xu bit her. Mr Jiang fought Xu off and went upstairs to find his stepdaughter, Wenjing. He discovered her lying on her back by the takeaway counter. Despite attempts by the family and then paramedics to resuscitate the teenager, she was pronounced dead at the scene at .pm. Police found Xu in the kitchen, having cut his own throat. He was treated at University Hospital of Wales before being arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. Xu admitted attacking -year-old Mr Jiang, but denied intending to kill him or cause him serious harm. He will be sentenced on Friday at the same court.

But it has gotten worse in recent weeks, with fire crews forced to retreat under a barrage of missiles and police patrols stepped up. Itaposs been a nightmare for months, but the worst was Sunday night, the mum said. My partner chased them and got our bins back, but then groups just swarmed. They were hurling abuse saying theyaposre going to rape me and my kids, then they were throwing things while I was in the house.

The woman, living in Erith, south east London, with her three children, said her family was living in inhumane conditions. She criticised Bexley Council after urgent building work to fix the chimney stack in her home meant scaffolding was used to replace the roof in September. The repairs also affected the plumbing system in the property, so the family had to use a bucket instead of the toilet.The mum also claimed the property was infested with mice, My London reports.Do you have a nightmare housing story  Email webnews@mirror  She said her family felt cold and her children were always in tears, but she refused an alternative offer of a hostel because of safety fears. Pictures of the home show scaffolding and plastic sheets were used in place of the removed roof. The work had to be carried out urgently after surveyors discovered a structural issue caused by dry rot. She told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: The flat was in a state of disrepair and there was no end of problems. My youngest daughter used to just cry. She really didnapost like it. It was not liveable. Everything was water damaged. Itaposs an absolute state. The wind was just blowing through, they didnapost secure the plastic, so it was completely open. She added: This was a multi-agency failure. And the fact that in this day children could be treated in this way is actually disgusting. The fact that my children had to go through what they went through is horrendous. Her three children, all aged eight and under, have since spent time with relatives outside the capital, but she says the ordeal has disrupted their schooling and affected their behaviour. She has since moved after opposition councillors stepped in, but said the issue left her unable to explain to her children why their home was so bad. The mum said: To be honest, I thought aposhow has it come to this apos My kids were crying and I had no answers for them. I canapost even give them their basic needs in le and itaposs an absolutely horrendous feeling. And going to the toilet in a bucket was just inhumane. She is set toto the property later this month once repairs are finished. Labour councillor Nicola Taylor, who became directly involved in the case after Mary visited her constituency office, said: I was shocked when I saw the state of this property and knew we had to get the family to a place of safety immediately. As I have become more involved in this case, I have serious concerns over the quality of these properties andthey are fit for our residents. I have still been unable to obtain surveyor or maintenance reports so I wondercouncil taxpayersapos money is being spent appropriately. Bexley Council said in a statement sent to The Mirror: The welfare of people we place in temporary accommodation is a priority for us and we work hard to ensure their safety. The extent of the repairs to this property only became evident following a leak, inspection by our staff and after a ceiling was removed. We identied the work that would be needed and offered the family alternative accommodation while it was carried out.

But EastEnders star Danny Dyer - being Danny Dyer - said it aloud last week. He reckons it’s cruel to have sex with just one person forever. So the hardman actor, who is married to his childhood sweetheart Jo Mas, will be green with envy at the lestyle of husband and we Paulina and Daniel Tenner. They’ve been married for eight years... and almost four years ago decided to “open” their marriage and have sex with other people. “If someone had asked me about this a few years back I’d never have thought I’d do it,” says Paulina, . “But that all changed as a result of some workshops I did about relationships, and I realised my sexual le force was blossoming.” It was then the entrepreneur and husband Daniel, , started talking about how an open marriage might work for them.What is your view on open marriages  Have your say in the comment section “For years we’d been monogamous,” says Paulina, who lives with Daniel in London. “But suddenly I was feeling attracted to dferent men, dferent women, everyone. In the early days of discussions, I may have been the driving force for this, but Daniel definitely needed to be on board - and he was. I wouldn’t have done it without us both feeling the same way.” After long discussions with her husband, Paulina started off at parties with other women that allowed her to “explore her bi-curious fantasies” while Daniel also started seeing other women. He says: “We had talked a lot before we made our decision, and we’d come to the same conclusion. Part of the purpose of le is to really feel that you’re alive and to explore all the interesting things in the world. One of the most fascinating things is the relationships we have with other people. To cut off any of these avenues means you’re sacricing an important part of your le, a part you could derive a huge amount of joy from. “That’s why the comments from Danny Dyer really resonate, because you’re cutting things off, you’re cutting off amazing things that you might have discovered through a connectionyou don’t explore it.”  Over two years the couple each had a series of lovers. Paulina connected with both men and women, and Daniel just dated women. Paulina thinks she had around  partners, while Daniel says he’s not interested in keeping count. “To me, counting lovers is a feature of monogamous le, when there’s pressure, especially on men, to have this sort of ego boost from having a large number of lovers,” he says. “It isn’t something I’m interested in.” The pair spent one New Year’s Eve together with their separate partners - Paulina with her Norwegian boyfriend, while Daniel came along with the British woman he was seeing at the time. “We felt like a big, polyamorous family,” says Paulina. “It was so natural and normal. I was with my lover, and Daniel was with the woman he was seeing at the time, a lady I was good friends with. It was lovely, flowing and natural.”  On seeing her husband with another partner Paulina says: “There was no jealousy. In fact there was satisfaction that he was experiencing something new and interesting. We have no secrets and our relationship is wonderfully transparent.” Daniel agrees jealousy is not a factor. “The idea Paulina is have a wonderful experience with someone  does not create jealousy,” he says. “Jealousy is a term that lumps together a bunch of other things, usually the fear of losing the other person and an envy of what they’ve got. But I haven’t felt a fear of losing Paulina to her other lovers, and I was being nourished and getting what I wanted too, so envy didn’t arise either.” Paulina, who has written a book after training in burlesque dancing, Laid Bare: What the Business Leader Learnt From the Stripper, says she built some deep connections with other partners, particularly the Norwegian man she dated for around two years in parallel with her marriage. She says while maintaining more than one relationship at a time might sound like a lot of effort, the newness of having dferent partners is “exciting”. “I actually think online dating sounds way more exhausting,” she laughs. “Just sex with no emotions is not very interesting to me,” adds Paulina. “Of course I get that people want to want to have just have sex, and that’s fine, but for Daniel and I, we’re looking for more depth. OK, it won’t be as deep a connection as we have with each other, but it needs to be more than just friends with benefits. There has to be a real connection for the sex to be worth it.”  Daniel says having other lovers actually brought him closer to his we. “Encounters with other people have been enjoyable,” he says. “But they also made me realise, even as the connections grew deeper with some women, they led me back to my we.” And while the couple enjoyed their two years in an open relationship, just before the lockdown was announced in early  they decided to suspend the open nature of their marriage - although at the minute they are considering opening it up once again. Pauline says: “At the minute we’re just together but it’s something we might come back to as it gave us so much joy and pleasure, as long as we protect the space for ourselves too.” Daniel adds: “I might be a step further towards opening up again than Paulina is. I don’t want to get to the end of my le and think I had all these opportunities to explore connections and didn’t take them.” The couple, who have been attending couples therapy for more than a year, are considering having children in the future. They have not yet decidedthey would follow the open marriage model while having a family, although Daniel thinks this would offer an open-minded and healthy example to any children. Paulina adds: “We think so many people would be happierthey knew polyamory was a valid option for them. We think there would be less cheating and fewer hearts would be brokenother couples were open about wanting about to make other connections in their le and decided to follow those connections with openness and honesty.”Laid Bare: What The Business Leader Learnt From the Stripper, by Paulina Tenner is out on November .

NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson told BBC Radio  thatdone right, the decision could drive take-up of the vaccines up .Here’s who be will impacted by the move to make vaccines mandatory. Who will the mandatory vaccination rule apply to  Frontline staff usually means staff that work directly with the public, rather than behind closed doors or in a support capacity.  This would include:doctors nurses midwives paramedics pharmacists social workers and care workersThe only people exempt from the mandatory policy will be those who do not have to face contact with patients and those who have a medical exemption. How many NHS workers do not have the jab  While care groups have been calling for the mandatory vaccine policy to be axed or delayed so providers can get through winter challenges without more staff leaving, the rule that they have to be immunised by this Friday or risk losing their job has seen many care workers who initially refused the vaccine, take the immunisation.  The health minister believes that, while some NHS staff may leave, making jabs mandatory will drive up vaccination rates by prompting those who have been refusing to finally get vaccinated in the same way that has already occurred with care home staff. According to latest NHS figures, almost a quarter of the care home staff were not recorded as having been double jabbed as of October , which means they might lose their jobs this week. Three-quarters of staff working in other social care settings outside of care homes, including non-registered providers and those employed by local authorities, have had their first jab. But only a third of them were doubled jabbed, with many having self-certied as exempt or applied for official proof.

According to insider reports, the change to the messaging  will let you create groups inside of other Groups. With this change, WhatsApp would come to be more like rival messengers Slack, the messaging  used primarily for work, and Discord, which is used for gaming. The newcould be useful to those with work communities that are segmented into lots of smaller groups within. Alternatively, community messenger groups could utilise theby splitting the group into separate chats for schooling or complaints about litter.According to reports from the Sun Online, clues about the new feature were first revealed in October, by tech site XDA Developers. And WhatsApp sleuths atWABetaInfohave now uncovered a preview showcasing what the feature would mean for users. While the preview gives a hint into what is to come, it doesn’t make it clear exactly what the feature will do. This name could mean anything, WABetaInfo said. But a Community is a new place where Group admins have more control over Groups on WhatsApp. Mainly to group other Groups easily. It’s likely the feature will be tested in the beta version of WhatsApp first, but it could take weeks or months, or even years for the feature to roll out to the general public. XDA Developers have warned that waiting for this feature could be a timely exercise. With the speed of feature introduction on WhatsApp, it could also take years before this feature comes to a stable release, the group previously said. On the flipside, some WhatApp features never make it past testingthey don’t work as intended. WhatsApp is also thought to be testing a feature that lets you use the app on multiple devices.WhatsApp haslost a lot of usersover the last year due to ongoing privacy concerns around its new terms of service.WhatsApp has traditionally marketed itself on offering secure, encrypted messaging, but announced wildly unpopular changes to the way it handles user data. These changes would have seen user data handed to private companies to aid in marketing.

The “friend” who thinks knowing us insulates them from the charge of racism when they are being just that. Ex-England cricketer Gary Ballance admitted in a statement last week he’d called Yorkshire teammate, Azeem Rafiq, a “P***” – but said it was done “in the spirit of friendly banter” . Ballance has come clean because, in August , Rafiq gave an interview in which he spoke about the racism he experienced at Yorkshire, including an “openly racist” captain and a dressing room in which racist comments were seen as humorous. The club effectively stuck its head in the sand, but an independent report has blown the whole thing wide open. Sponsors have withdrawn their cash, chairman Roger Hutton has resigned and English cricket’s most successful county has been banned from hosting internationals.  But back to Ballance. He claims to be incredulous that calling an Asian person the P-word could cause the kind of hurt and anguish it did to Rafiq. “If I’d believed it, I would have stopped immediately,” said Ballance. “He was my best cricket mate and I cared deeply for him.” Just not enough to stop using this horrendous racist slur against him. It is easy to believe this is a story just about Yorkshire, cricket or even sport. It isn’t. Go into any office, factory, shop floor or football club you like and you’ll find at least one dinosaur convinced that racist abuse can be used as a term of affection. ‘Can a racist term ever be defined as banter ’ trilled the Twitter account of the BBC’s Question Time. Yes, really. It may as well have asked whether slapping your partner is ever justied. Or whether political corruption is ever justiedthe money is for a good cause.  If ever we needed a snapshot of the institutional racism that infects this country to its core, the past week has provided it. Ironically, there is more outrage and anger directed at those who call it out - as Rafiq has found to his cost - than at the issue itself. Yet the fact remains, across any number of industries and sports, iniduals like him iniably find themselves one of the only Black or Asian people in the room at the mercy of the bigots. Across the country you’ll find iniduals pulling the emergency ripcord defence that their workmate, best friend, neighbour, partner, even husband or we is black. Asthat allows them a free pass to use the kind of language or go down the routes that would otherwise see them vilied. The Government does it even now. Prime Minister Boris Johnson surrounds himself with gatekeepers such as Kwasi Kwarteng, Kemi Badenoch and Priti Patel, believing it protects him from stick for describing Burqa-wearing women as looking like letterboxes. Or describing black people as ‘picaninnies’. Question Time is no exception. Presumably pointing to whatever black or Asian members it has on its production team. And no, it is no defence that the offensive question tweeted was one posed by an audience member to spark debate. Rafiq’s forthcoming appearance in front of a parliamentary select committee may well bring the rest of Yorkshire’s house of cards down. But the shock waves are already reverberating way beyond cricket. PS: You’re not someone’s friendyou’re using racist language towards them.

The US border re-opened to British travellers for the first time in  days or nearly  months. One traveller took to social media to share a video of long lines and blasting officials for disgraceful planning. It showed long queues snaking around the arrivals hall as hundreds wait to be let into the US. America is expecting a flood of international visitors crossing its borders by air and by land on Monday after lting travel restrictions for much of the worldaposs population first imposed in early  to address the spread of Covid-.  More than , passengers flew from London to New York City yesterday. British Airways took , travellers on  planes while Virgin Atlantic brought a further , customers on  flights shuttles into JFK.One Twitter user shared a video of the backlog of traffic and blamed three planes landing at once.He wrote:  months closed lots of time to get things right and JFK Airport queues are a disgrace, three planes landing at the same time from Manchester is ridiculous.  Asked how long he had been waiting, he added: Two hours mate, pathetic. We were all sweating. Just approaching Manhattan now. Paul Richards, , who is head of safeguarding for Stoke City FC, also said he waited two hours after his Virgin Atlantic flight from London.He told USA Today : No point in getting irate, the queue will still be there. Policeman Marc Evans, , who flew from Manchester, with his we and two children said he waited more than an hour. He said: It was apparently a PR stunt to show the USA was back open but seems they werenapost concerned about the queues at customs. Another wrote on Twitter: Great. Queues are JFK are bad enough without two planes touching down at the same time. Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Ed Bastian had earlier said: Itaposs going to be a bit sloppy at first. I can assure you, there will be lines, unfortunately. He added: Weaposll get it sorted out. Heathrow Airport also received numerous complaints on social media for long queues. One wrote on Twitter: Beside myself with appalling service of @BritishAirwaysT trying to get my lovely mum on a flight! @HeathrowAirport waiting  hours now! for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.She added: Sheaposs gone through security. But we are both in tears… this is not a good experience! Another wrote: @HeathrowAirport someone needs to inform your airport assistance personnel that a long connection is nice license to leave a customer sitting and waiting. Yesterday was an emotional day for many as Britons were reunited with friends and family for the first time in  months.

Daphna Cardinale, , and her husband Alexander said they could not experience the first months of le of their second daughter, who was born in another family after embryos were exchanged. The mum explained: Alexander and I are devastated, we missed an entire year of our daughteraposs le. I didnapost get to experience being pregnant with her, or birthing her. We missed her entire newborn period, we never saw our babyaposs entrance into the world or cuddled her in her first seconds of le. Our memories of childbirth will always be tainted by the sick reality that our biological child was given to someone . And the baby with I fought to bring into this world was not mine to keep. The dad added: When the truth came to light, it made exchanging the children all the more heartbreaking. Losing the birth child that you now for the genetic child that you donapost even know yet. Itaposs a truly impossible nightmare that inflicted trauma.Mrs and Mr Cardinale welcomed a little girl in September  and became immediately suspicious because the baby had a darker skin tone than theirs. Initially, they put their thoughts aside as they trusted the IVF process and started raising the child as they fell in love with her. However, two months after the birth, they decided to carry out at-home DNA tests, making the shocking discovery that the girl was not their biological daughter and they had been raising someone aposs child. The tests also meant that another couple had been raising the Cardinalesapos biological child, according to a lawsuit filed on Monday. Together with the couple who had been affected by the mix-up, the parents decided to swap the girls and start raising their own babies - after missing out on their births and first months of le. This week, they announced their decision to sue the IVF clinic where the alleged mix-up happened. Mrs Cardinale said her familyaposs heartbreak and confusion canapost be understated, adding she was robbed of the ability to carry my own child.The lawsuit explains that the couple sought help from the Calornia Center for Reproductive Healthand In VitroTech Labs, an embryology lab, in the summer of .In VitroTech Labs allegedly inserted the embryos into the wrong women.  The legal document reads: Daphna was surgically implanted - against her will or knowledge - with the sperm and egg of a man and woman who were complete strangers to her. Meanwhile, Daphna and Alexander’s embryo was transferred to that same couple, Couple Two, a few weeks after Daphna’s transfer procedure. Couple Two carried to term and gave birth to a baby girl - Alexander and Daphna’s biological child - and raised her for months before Defendants’ mistakes were uncovered and proven. The lawsuit adds that when Mrs Cardinale gave birth to a daughter that was not hers, her husband felt like something was wrong. The document explains: He expected to see a fair child, much like their older daughter. Instead, their Birth Daughter came out with much darker skin and jet-black hair. It was so jarring that Alexander actually took several steps away from the birthing table, backing up against the wall. According to the document, some friends and family members also started questioning the couple about the babyaposs appearance.  The situation led to disconnect between the couple as Mr Cardinale - a musician - was worried his we was in denial. He was so upset that he would stay up at night, staring at their newborn child, wonderingshe was truly theirs, the lawsuit adds. The document says: After learning this, Daphna insisted they take the DNA test, expecting that the results would put everyone’s mind at ease. After several rounds of DNA tests, the Cardinales found out the truth and on December ,  contacted the couple who had been raising their biological child. When they met at a lawyeraposs office, their meeting was terribly uncomfortable, the legal document says. On December , the couples met with their children and for the first time they got to see their biological daughters.  The following day, the Cardinales told their older daughter about the mix-up and she was crushed and terried of losing her birth sister, begging her parents not to switch the babies. About two weeks later, the parents officially switched their children, which took an emotional toll on the whole family. The lawsuit states: The horror of this situation cannot be understated. Mrs Cardinale, who works as a therapist, and her singer-songwriter husband have had to seek help for symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD, the legal action explains. Adam B Wolf, a lawyer representing the Cardinales, said the second family also plans to sue the IVF clinic but wants to remain anonymous. In vitro fertilisationis one of several techniques available to help people with fertility problems have a baby.During IVF, an egg is removed from the womanaposs oies and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory, the NHS explains.The fertilised egg, called an embryo, is then ed to the womanaposs womb to grow and develop. It can be carried out using your eggs and your partneraposs sperm, or eggs and sperm from donors. The Mirror has contacted CCRH and In VitroTech Labs for comment.

She named the dog Run Run, and when local livestock was being attacked at night she never thought that it could be her pet that was the culprit.But then someone pointed out that their dog looked suspiciously like an Andean fox - complete with bushy tail and pointed head, as Sky News reports. Maribel, from Lima, Peru, said: We had thought he was a purebred puppy. A lady told us that it had eaten three large guinea pigs.Walter Silva, a local veterinarian and wildle specialist, said it is not uncommon for wild animals to be brought from Amazonian areas by traffickers to be illegally traded in Lima.He said: Trafficking in wildle brings these consequences. Many specimens are captured from hatchlings. For this, they kill the parents and these juveniles are illegally traded in informal markets. In this case, a fox bought as a domestic dog. The fox has since gone missing, but officials of the state National Forest and Wildle Service said they will take him to a special centre or zoo once he is found. Meanwhile, one dog owner was relieved when she finally discovered why she constantly had aposfilthyapos windows - as she caught her dog mindlessly licking them. Anna Dunford, , has two Siberian huskies, Bear and Baloo, and for the past two years her windows had been growing increasingly hard to keep clean and she had no idea why. Then one day, her mother was looking after the dogs and went to prepare their food in the kitchen, and to de-stress the process she shut the dogs in the next room, separated by a door with glass windows. The hungry dogs lined up to watch as their dog-sitter scooped out their food, and as she glanced back she noticed that eager Baloo had his nose pressed against the glass and was licking away in anticipation.

Javier has become a bit of a hit on TikTok where he uploads videos as @unicosobreviviente, which translates to aposonly survivorapos, but heaposs not without his haters.He claims to be stuck alone in the future as the rest of the earthaposs population has been wiped out by a disaster, and he uploads videos of the Spanish city he is in as proof. But some say that heaposs filming deserted parts or visiting areas at quiet times of day, so the TikToker has now uploaded footage of a busy city junction - which is eerily deserted. What do you think about Javieraposs claims  Let us know in the comments...In the past, Javier has shared footage of a secret passageway in the abandoned city, and clips from a shopping area thataposs become a ghost town - but was recently challenged by a follower on social media. They asked him to upload a clip with a view, which he did, then they asked him to upload the same clip but filmed in the daytime - saying they would believe himthat too made the city look empty. So Javier did so, and in this clip, the roads of the city look completely empty - but TikTok users were still quick to pick the footage part. One said: Look closely at the dark spots in the intersection you can see some movements. Looks like something was edited out.

How can you send a TikTok from the future to the past using internet from there asked a third user. Does the frequency of the wave go between time and space and dimension  And a fourth suggested: I dare you to go to Egypt, the pyramids. Javier captioned the video: Waking up, everything changes place. I am trapped between  and . I am in a world parallel to yours. Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

After listening to more of the messages, the -year-old TikToker realised the messages werenapost from a stalker, and they were in fact from a woman who had lost her husband and was leaving messages for her deceased partner on his old number. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Youaposre just trying to clear your voicemails and notice a number you donapost recognise in blocked numbers ... that has been leaving you voicemails since July , , the TikToker wrote alongside a clip of herself crying. All the voicemails consist of aposI miss youapos and and aposI hope youaposre okayapos and long pauses and what sounds to be soft crying  The -year-old then shared a screengrab from her phone, showing all the messages sheaposd been receiving, sometimes having four missed voicemails per day from the grieving lady. She quietly played one of the messages out loud, in which the woman can be heard saying: Itaposs just me, youaposve been on my mind. Iaposll catch you later, bye. The TikTok user continued: Then you realise itaposs this old lady leaving voicemails to her [late] husband... In the comments section, the TikToker asked for advice on whether she should call the lady or just continue allowing her to leave the messages, and she later concluded that she would leave the woman to it, as many suggested it was probably a much-needed coping mechanism for her. Many people also commented to say they have similar coping mechanisms, and regularly leave messages for loved ones who have passed away.

The eatery opens at am, but Maura Estafeliz has set up everything an hour before her sht.She first turns on all the machines including the fryer, boilers, heaters, ice cream machines and computers. The employee records the time before filling up the ice cream machine with milk and prepares the drink station. She tells how she fills all the soft drinks before making fresh coffee and tea. Maura then pours a bag of ground coffee into the machine and lets it brew.  Meanwhile, she grabs a bucket of ice to fill up the iced coffee and iced tea machines. She pours the hot coffee into a ice-filled plastic bag to cool down and starts making tea with another tray.. The worker than has to do some computer work where she prints out all the inventory lists and ticks boxes on the menu checklists ensure the restaurant is ready to open. Her tasks continue marking expiry dates for ingredients such as creamer, coffee and eggs.The Daily Star reports that she can then say: All done, after placing printed out labels where they are needed.Some people thought they were watching a complete McDonaldaposs video, but others were horried by the colour of the oil in the fryer and asked when it was last changed.

Veronika Rajekaposs social media profile are regularly reported as being fake, she has claimed. The -year-old believes that aposle is harder for beautul people and that she so hot people just think Iaposm fake. Others allegedly bully the former Miss Slovakia  finalist for having had plastic surgery, which she insists isnapost true. People don’t even believe I exist, Veronika said. It’s pretty discriminatory that other women can do the same thing as me and I can’t, and I just get deleted because of my looks.  I call myself an alien as people don’t believe I’m real. They think I’m an AI robot or a catfish online. People say beautul people have it easy but I have it worse as people make it harder for me because I’m beautul.The model, based in Vienna, Austria, travels the world making content for her Instagram – and claims people are always surprised when they meet her for the first time.Veronika claims she receives hundreds of messages from women body shaming her on a regular basis and that many claim she uses filters to advance her looks.  Veronika, who has . million followers on Instagram, said: I get messages from men who donapost think Iaposm real but the worst messages on my Instagram are from women asking me why I’m pretending and asking for proof. I don’t make any adjustments, shaping or filters – I use a skin smoothing tool but I think that’s normal. Skinny girls are body shaming plus-sized models but I’m being body shamed too as they donapost think I’m natural.  I get more abuse from women as they are jealous and they think I want their boyfriend. Only women can hurt other women so strongly. I donapost think I’m perfect but I’m natural in real le, but people are scared of me and donapost want to talk to me. To end the rumours of plastic surgery and claims sheaposs a catfish or robot, Veronika has resorted to desperate measures. She is planning to get a scan of her breasts to prove people wrong. The model paid £ for a breast examination while in Dubai in October, which included a quick scan. She said: I was forced to do this check-up to get people to believe me. People question the naturality of my breasts so I went to a doctor to get a breast examination and proof that they’re real, with no enhancements, objects or scars. My doctor was really surprised as she thought I’d had surgery too and said I had the most beautul natural breasts.  I worked out so much at teenage years that I developed muscles which make my breasts a nice shape. I’m not trying to be sexual, I just have big boobs. God gave me these gts and I want people to believe me. Veronika takes good care of her body - not drinking or partying, instead working out five times a week. But her beauty has also come at a price. She added: ‘I don’t have many friends but I feel good. If you feel beautul the way you are, then you are beautul. If you feel confident in your body and you are plus-sized, then just be confident. “If you have had plastic surgery, just be honest. If you take care of yourself, you can be beautul too.

Sisters Ophelia and Tarrow died when a fire broke out in their bedroom in Byron Bay, New South Wales, Australia while they were staying with their dad James Wright. Their mum Akira Garton wrote no more mumma ... no more hands ... no more smiles, no more dancing, no more moments like this in a devastating post online. It is believed a candle placed on a piano was the cause of the fire on Sunday, according to reports. There’s no suggestion of any wrongdoing and no charges have been laid in the accident, reports say.  Ambulance crews attempted CPR on the little girls but devastatingly they were unable to be revived.“Thank you for every thought, word, text, missed call and gesture,” their mother Akira wrote on Tuesday morning,  news reports.“Words cannot express waking up to Day  of these beautul bunnikins not here ... no more mumma ... no more hands ... no more smiles, no more dancing, no more moments like this, happy, so happy - October  . “I’m devastated. It was too early. I never thought I’d use social media to communicate this.  “I will try to respond when I can and have words beyond disbelief.”A gofundme page has been set up to help the grieving mum.The page says: Every mother’s worst nightmare suddenly became reality for our darling Akira on Sunday morningwhen she heard the news that her  year old twin girls had lost their lives in a house fire in Goonengary, NSW, Australia. Tarrow and Ophelia were bright, playful, identical twins that had a sparkle in their eyes and angelic features.  They loved and adored their older sister Maitreya so so much… just as they were loved and adored by all close to them. There is no word in English for a parent who loses their child, and there shouldn’t be. It is an unthinkable tragedy. Akira and her family are shattered to the core they have an unbearable amount of grief to carry and heartbreaking pain to endure. Friends of the twinsapos dad have also set up a fundraiser to help him cover upcoming expenses. The gofundme says: :Early on Sunday morning November the th our dear Jimmi lost his darling girls, Ophelia and Tarrow to a tragic house fire.These beautul little fairies left this earth too soon, and the loss for Jimmi and family is unspeakable. It is now for us, his friends and family, to come together and create a legacy of lasting love and support. Aside from the onslaught of grief and sorrow, that is already devastating the family, there is an impending slew of debt, funeral costs, and day-to-day expenses that we hope to cover through this collection.

Along with the leboat, the warship HMS Eastbourne, Fishery Protection vessel Vigilant and the US Navy ship Victoria began combing the area between the south of Arran and Kintyre.They were joined later in the search by a Dakota aircraft from Prestwick.An RAF patrol vessel stood by at Campbeltown.Campbeltown leboat reported the discovery of a large piece of timber. It was, however, too heavy to lt aboard and it was not thought to be part of possible wreckage.Then, after six hours, the search was called off.

goal last Saturday after an th-minute strike resigned the Kintyre Park side to a narrow defeat away to St Peter#s.Playing at Renfrew FC#s impressive New Western Park, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils started the match brightly, despite another y injury list which saw several established first-team players ruled out and others unavailable due to work commitments.The Pupils took the lead before the -minute mark when John McCallum, playing at right wing in a --- formation, reacted quickest to Craig Lamont#s long throw-in, which bounced up on the dry synthetic surface, to guide a deft looping header beyond the reach of the St Peter#s keeper.The Kintyre side had efforts from left winger Scott Souden and lone striker Sean Grady go wide of the target – the latter#s promising effort deflected wide of goal – while McCallum was released by Grady and rounded the hosts# keeper only for his cutback to be cleared for a corner, away from the feet of the waiting Souden.At the other end, the Pupils had a new-look combination in defence, with full backs Craig Lamont and Michael McKinlay, and Ross Souden in central defence partnered by -year-old debutant Antonio Akoulli, studying in Scotland and hailing from Thessaloniki, Greece.The four had to be alert to the efforts of St Peter#s wingers Menzies and Lewis on either flank, and did so very well for the opening  minutes until a lapse in concentration saw Scott Lewis – signed from fellow WoSFL side Benburb FC for a transfer fee – ghost along the edge of the box and slot home a fine finish across keeper Alasdair Ferguson with his weaker left foot, into the young keeper’s bottom left-hand corner to make it -.Impressively, the Pupils rebounded from this setback and scored with  minutes played when Liam Renton, playing as an attacking midfielder, latched onto a ball from Scott Souden just inside the hosts# box, and turned his marker sharply before guiding a left-footed shot beyond the keeper#s grasp.All the while, the Pupils# deep-lying midfield pairing – a real contrast of experience levels between skipper Keith Mitchell, and Conner Brown beside him making his club debut – continued to break up play and keep the Feathers Inn-sponsored side moving forward.Despite this, there was a further scare in the visitors# penalty area when St Peter#s hit the bar from a powerful volleyed shot on the stroke of half time, but the Pupils# lead remained intact.Into the second half, though, the Pupils were pegged back in the opening few minutes of proceedings, a clever turn and precise shot beyond the grasp of Ferguson providing a fine equaliser.Admirably from a Pupils point of view, there was no onslaught from the ision#s third-placed team, also boasting a loan signing from Greenock FC, another semi-professional side, in their midfield ranks, and smatterings of semi-pro experience across their starting .However, what followed instead was a gradual build-up of pressure which the Pupils had to work increasingly hard to contain, the home side#s willing forwards continuing to probe for openings in the visitors# defence.The hard-working pair of Matthew Lang and Calum Houston were introduced in attack for the Pupils with  minutes remaining, with fresh legs required as the embattled visitors# energy levels began to wane.But even the dismissal of Lewis for the hosts, hitting out at Renton in reaction to a robust tackle from the latter, which earned the Pupils man a booking, couldn#t deny the Paisley side a late, late winner, a long ball going undefended in the Pupils ranks, and slotted home in the box by a St Peter#s midfielder to give them all three points, and in turn deny the Pupils a probably deserved draw.The Pupils# management team conveyed thanks to the travelling players for their efforts, even in defeat, and will surely take consolation from giving experience to young talent in the side, with four club debuts made in the space of week – after -year-old Andrew Renton#s appearance against Rossvale on cup duty – and within that clutch, a potentially very useful defensive addition.Tomorrow , the Pupils are at home to Glenvale FC, from Paisley, again on league duty, with kick off at pm.For more information, visit @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 29 2021","story":"More must be done to prevent the continued spate of

It was the lockdown which entrenched this: screens were the way to connect with people, friends, family and even school learning.They became the default activity and I believe itrsquos become an unhealthy addiction for us and as the nights have drawn in, with less opportunity for outside activity and walks in nature, this addiction has the risk of becoming even worse.I know screens are not all bad, they have benefits and advantages too. . . hell knows, I spend so much time on screens myself.I think we can be too hard on ourselves at times and Irsquom aware of that. Irsquod go to say that some screen time is now important for a iety of reasons. I also recognise that in the last two years they have become a leline for many people.But lately I have been trying my best to practise what I preach as a storyteller. I want to find ways to wean my kids, and myself, from screens to find a healthier balance, a more personal connection which lts our mental health rather than sapping it.Itrsquos not been easy. When the kids are asked to come off screens, they often explode with what I call screen rage. Itrsquos aswe are cutting an umbilical cord and removing their le support system, and they must fight and protest to restore it. The drama is predictable and tiring, but the good news is itrsquos usually relatively short-lived. Irsquove discovered that kids are eventually glad when they have been taken off excessive use of screens.The trick is to have something engaging to replace it with, as well as to model it myself. Thatrsquos the thing, itrsquos so easy to be a hypocrite to tell my kids itrsquos the end of screen time, while using my phone or writing on my laptop.ldquoBut you are still on a screen, dad! was the rebuke from my astute eight-year-old daughter recently. And she was right, so the rules have to apply to me and my we too.We are slowly getting there. We have no screens before bedtime now, instead a family storytelling session. The hardest part has been establishing the routine with so much to do. But now the kids look forward to it and help make the living room cosy in preparation.And I feel the benefits too. It helps me close down that ruminator in my head, which constantly reminds me of how much I have to do, emails I need to reply to, deadlines I need to meet. Instead I become focused on the moment, on the fact Irsquom sharing the attention of my loved ones and we are all telling stories.I know this now does sound overly romantic, but the thing is nothing can compare to these moments of connection, such as the magic of listening to my wee boy tell another spontaneous chapter of his tale of the haunted pizzeria, or listening to my girls weave a story rooted in their experiences of the day or a favoured fable from their earlier childhood. And Irsquove discovered my we Kate is a good storyteller when given the opportunity.Maybe it felt awkward at first, that we were doing it because I thought we should be rather than because we all wanted to. But that awkwardness soon gave way to excited expectation and genuine enjoyment of the experience. And the darkness helps, itrsquos a blanket which adds atmosphere and allows us to use fairy lights and candles, so in that sense the cold and dark of this time of year is a huge advantage: itrsquos the season for cosy storytelling.The flicker of screens still shine more regularly than the storytelling candles in our house. But the balance is slowly changing. Hallowersquoen helped, it seemed such a natural time for storytelling. And I think I can say we have now established our storytelling sessions as a regular family tradition. When it happens, it feels like ancient magic has entered our house.I run storytelling sessions with parents and many share the challenges I recognise in my own family. All families are dferent, of course, and no child is the same. Buta family storytelling tradition can be established, everyone feels the benefits. Evenonly every now and then, they will be times of real connection that everyone will remember.Soyou fancy trying it and would like my short guide with some reflections and tips, drop me an email. Or maybe you have tips and experiences yoursquod like to share recently, a parent told me that bath time was storytelling time in her house, as she sat on the toilet telling favoured tales to her young children!

Martin says that the Spott Kirk Session minutes record the referral of Marion Lillie to the civil magistrate in  on a charge of supposed witchcraft and that in  the minutes record: ldquoMany witches burnt at the top of Spott Loan.Mr Martin was, however, wrong.The Spott Kirk Session minutes are exceptionally legible and clear, and they make no reference whatsoever in  to witch burning at Spott Loan or anywhere .Nor is there any mention of Marion Lillie in .However, in , Marion and her son complained to the kirk session that she was being slandered as a witch.A y investigation followed in which it came to light that Marion did indeed have that reputation locally.Since kirk sessions were not qualied to try witchcraft cases, the session passed the matter on to the civil magistrate, as they were required to do.However, there is no evidence of the case being taken any further and the Spott records show that Marion died a natural death in April  and was buried in Spott kirkyard with the usual ceremonial trappings of bell and mortcloth.Unfortunately, many writers on Scottish witchcraft make the mistake of simply repeating what other writers have written, instead of going to the original records to see what was really going on.Poor Marion has thus been slandered in print as an executed witch for over  years, when half an hour spent actually reading the church records of Spott could have revealed the truth.Until recently, a plaque at the Witchesrsquo Stone stated that Marion Lillie was burnt there, but this has now been replaced by one which makes no mention of her.It may well be that the Witchesrsquo Stone marks the execution of a witch, or witches, but the victim was not Marion Lillie, and any such execution was neither in  nor in , which in any case would be

regarding the rising numbers of hospitalisations with Covid, which reflected the viruss prevalence among the older population.Warnings were issued before COP suggesting that cases could surge after the summit due to the influx of people to the city.However, the Scottish government has repeatedly confirmed it is doing everything it can to mitigate the chances of a rise in infection rate.Following another Covid statement, heres what we learned from todays announcement...A further , cases of Covid were recorded over the past -hours in Scotland,meaning cases continue to hover around the , mark.Cases have recently plateaued around this figure following a decline after a surge in the summer due to the easing of restrictions.The deputy first minister confirmed that as of today,  million boosters and third vaccines had been administered in Scotland.Theres a risk that the spread of the virus could surge againthe past pattern is anything to go by, according to John Swinney.He expressed concern that Covid case rates could rise in coming weeks due to Christmas mingling indoors and with loved ones as the weather gets colder and the festive period nearer.He confirmed that the government was considering whether to extend the Covid certication scheme to indoor hospitality venues and other areas.However, the deputy first minister added that no decisions on this have yet been made.The three weekly review of the measures currently in place will take place a week today, and John Swinney said they could not rule out reintroducing or strengthening measures.The deputy first minister

win over Australia, but against arguably the most respected and feared forward units in world rugby, but he is still listed as an academy player at Sale Sharks and has played only  senior pro matches so far in his fledgling career.Ashman has established himself as a player with a big future, who is already capable of competing on the international stage, but it would be a big ask for him to front-up again versus the might of South Africa just six days after playing  minutes against Australia.Meanwhile, second-row Scott Cummings is also expected to be in the frame when the team to face South Africa is announced on Thursday after missing the first two matches of this Autumn Test series whilst rehabbing from an operation on his arm at the start of October.ldquoThere were a few knocks and bruises [after the Australia game], but we had some pleasing news this morning, to realise that nothing is as major as we thought last night, said Dalziel yesterday.ldquoThe guys will get through recovery protocols and medical checkouts today, but we have now massive concerns at all. Fingers crossed nothing develops later in the day.ldquoGeorge came off having felt a rib in a scrum, which can be uncomfortable, a pretty sharp pain, he added. ldquoBut therersquos been a huge turnaround with him this morning and hersquos bouncing about as normal. George is a resilient character and its good news. Wersquore pretty sure hersquos going to turn it around quicker than we thought yesterday.There is an obvious temptation to reward the players who got the job done against the worldrsquos third ranked team, in the cut-throat world of professional rugby,nobodyrsquos place in the teamis guaranteed.ldquoWersquove got to pick the right team to complement the challenges wersquoll face against South Africa, stated Dalziel. ldquoThey are very dferent to Australia who have that attack focus and want to play a lot of rugby, whereas with the South Africans it is a physical battle. Straight up and down. They are coming straight through the front door at us.ldquoSo, tactically, and selection-wise, wersquoll look at that.A lot of guys who were maybe quieter in that Tonga game [two weekends ago] have now put their hand up and performed.But when you look around the squad there may be guys who werenrsquot involved at the weekend who might be suited to this challenge, so no doubt there could be and probably will be a few changes around that.ldquoThe squad is growing all the time, and wersquore blessed as coaches to have the group wersquove got now through the good work which is going on at the pro teams and through the age grades, he added.ldquoWersquore able to keep building on that and young players are bouncing off each other. Wersquore seeing thatone player goes to the next level then wersquove got more players looking to push beyond that. Nobody is comfortable in any position.ldquoWersquove got real quality players missing out on selection, and it is hard for us to try and pick the right team for the right opposition now, while making sure that we are keeping everyone hungry, and making sure that people are getting opportunities when they deserve it.Despite the magnitude of the challenge Scotland face on Saturday Dalziel insisted that the team will go into the match believing they have nothing to fear.ldquoIrsquove been lucky enough to work with these players for a number of years, from the under-s onwards, he said. ldquoIrsquove seen them grow as men and itrsquos outstanding, the high standards they hold with each other.ldquoAs a group, they deal with setbacks, know the path theyrsquore on, and there is no ceiling.They want to grow and become that Scotland team that is consistent, that can win on the big occasion more often.ldquoTheyrsquore very humble and realise wersquore at the start of the process.Itrsquos a young group with loads of growth to come.

This change will take effect from Monday, November  until at least Wednesday, November .Infection among both pupils and staff at the school have mounted in recent days. As of this evening  pupils have been confirmed as COVID-positive, along with five members of staff. A further four members of staff have recorded positive lateral flow test results.As a result, the nursery has been forced to close entirely, while four primary classes will remain home.The classes to close from Monday to Wednesday are: PM, PE. Classes PE and PM are to close on Monday only at this time. Online learning will be offered to affected pupils.According to a statement released by OIC, this evening, the situation will remain under daily review andthe position changes, parents and staff will be updated.The remainder of classes at Papdale Primary School will be open on Monday as usual.James Wylie, OIC’s executive director of education, leisure and housing said: “Staff have been working tirelessly over the last week to try and ensure Papdale Primary and Nursery were able to remain open in full, however, this has now reached the point where it is simply no longer possible. There are several factors for this including staff reporting positive PCR test results, being contact traced by Public Health, and the supply teaching staff list having been exhausted.“We realise that this may cause childcare issues for working parents and that is partly why we will keep the closures to an absolute minimum and monitor and manage the situation on a daily basis, ensuring that the settings are able to reopen once it is safe to do so with the appropriate staffing levels in place. It is also vital that we keep our educational facilities open whenever possible for the learning of our children, who have already missed out on so much these past  months of the pandemic.“I, again, take this opportunity to thank our staff, parents and pupils for the way in which we all continue to manage these situations, which are challenging for everyone. We must all continue to do our bit to try and stem the transmission of the virus, which is undoubtedly here for some time to come. This is now about learning to manage how we live, work and learn with COVID-. Please continue to follow the guidance, which is outlined by our colleagues at NHS Orkney below.”According to NHS Orkney, around one in three people with COVID- don’t show any symptoms.The health authority believes it is more important than ever to take your two free COVID lateral flow tests every week and record your results, evenyou are fully vaccinated and don#t have symptoms.Lateral flow test kits can be collected from community pharmacies and local test sites or ordered online at nhsinform.scot testing.  You can access the direct link to order LFD tests here: https:www.gov.uk order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flowRecording both positive and negative results allows NHS Orkney Public Health to track the presence of the virus in our communities.Find out more at nhsinform.scot testingIf you, or anyone in your household is displaying symptoms of COVID, or you have a positive lateral flow testyou must self-isolate immediately and book a PCR test in Orkney by calling  .A reminder of the ways we stay safe and protect ourselves and others against COVID are:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

According to authorities, many stayed hone due to a iety of COVID-related reasons, such as self-isolation or because they were symptomatic and awaiting a PCR test.A small number of parents have also chosen not to send their child children to school.James Wylie, OIC’s executive director of education, leisure and housing said: “Following advice from our colleagues at NHS Orkney Public Health during an inter-disciplinary meeting today, Friday, the joint decision was made to an agreed set of enhanced mitigating measures at Papdale Primary School.“The situation is being managed and monitored with the advice and guidance of Public Health for which we are very grateful.“It is important for schools to remain open while it is deemed safe by all to do so. We will continue to work with our colleagues at Public Health evaluating the numbers and should it reach a point whereby it is felt necessary for a partial or full closure, then that decision will be made collectively.“I, again, thank everyone for continuing to answer our plea for children who are well and not displaying any COVID symptoms to still attend at school as this is vital for their education and social well-being.”Targeted “warn and inform letters” have been sent to parents of children in the affected classes. Papdale head teacher, Wendy Bowen, has also written to all parents to reassure that all necessary mitigating steps are being taken.Meanwhile NHS Orkney are continuing to report double figure numbers of cases across the county on a daily basis.According to the health authority, these cases are a mixture of household contacts, travel and working environment contacts amongst others. As was mentioned last week, they were expecting to see numbers of cases continue to be high in coming days.NHS Orkney consultant of public health, Sara Lewis said: “Papdale Primary School remains open, but we have agreed an enhanced set of measures not only to reassure parents, pupils, staff and the wider community, but also to ensure we are doing all we can to keep on top of the situation. Schools do remain an area of typically low transmission and a safe place for children.“We ask that you continue to follow the guidance in place, ensuring good ventilationindoors, washing hands, wearing face coverings and keeping a safe distance from those out with your household,possible.”If you develop COVID symptoms, however mild, oryou have a positive lateral flow test, you must immediately self-isolate with your household and book a PCR test. This is regardless of your vaccination status. You can book a PCR test by calling the Covid Assessment Centre on   which remains open this weekend.NHS Orkney is urging the community to continue with twice weekly lateral flow tests for anyone who doesn’t have COVID symptoms and to record these results online.The public health team are continuing to urge everyone within our community to stick to the guidance of wearing face coverings when inside, keeping the required distance from others, ventilating spaces where possible and to maintain handwashing and sanitising.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211103_133201-scaled.jpg","title":"climate action group to hold skye bridge march and vigil in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, which formed shortly before the pandemic, is inviting people to show their solidarity with activists across the world in highlighting the need for urgent change to tackle the existential threat of climate change.Speaking to the Free Press during the first week of the COP UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Skye Climate Action coordinator Anne MacLennan described the summit as “critically important” and was keen to emphasise that Saturday’s event should take place in a peaceful and respectable manner.#Saturday is the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, and the themes are that we need to act, and act urgently, and there is also the huge justice issue,# she said.“The idea for the march is for us to leave the Kyleakin-end at  noon and to walk over the bridge by the pavements and walk back again.#It is really important that the event is peaceful, family-friendly, and respectful of everyone # I think it is a demonstration of the kind of society we want to head towards being, so we can live in a sustainable and equitable way.

Through this revolutionary Hydrogen Training Academy, our Borough will continue to build upon its reputation as centre of excellence and the main focal point of the emerging Northern Ireland wide hydrogen economy.“I commend Council’s Elected Members and officers who, in collaboration with our public and private sector partners, have invested a huge amount of time and effort in bringing the project to this stage. I very much look forward to seeing the plans come to fruition in the coming months and witnessing the longer-term economic impact the Academy will undoubtedly have in the coming years.”Graham Whitehurst MBE, Chair of Mid and East Antrim’s Manufacturing Task Force, explained how the Academy will play a “critical role” in training and upskilling both existing employees and new trainees to a recognised professional competence standard required for the hydrogen sector.“The Hydrogen Training Academy will deliver a range of crucial entry-level introductory training for industry across a number of sectors, including energy, transport, gas, manufacturing and engineering,” he said.“This training will be delivered via a combination of online, classroom and practical training focused across four key areas of hydrogen – hydrogen basics and safety, production of hydrogen, high pressure hydrogen and hydrogen in vehicles.”According to Mr Whitehurst, an initial pilot phase at the Academy will see  participants take part in a ‘Train the Trainer’ course, delivered by academics from the University of Birmingham, who have already successfully delivered their ‘KnowHy Training’ to over , participants.Among the participants will be representatives from the Further Education sector in Northern Ireland, who will then draw upon their training to develop and accredit two Level  courses for delivery to young people and employees across the hydrogen industry.

These are very welcome as we work through these dficult circumstances.“We will continue to monitor and liaise with the PSNI, our trade union colleagues and local communities to reassess the situation daily.“As we safely move to reinstating services, we will keep everyone updated through our website www.translink, Twitter or call the contact centre on      to get the latest service information before you travel.”Meanwhile, Translink chief executive Chris Conway has called for “political leadership” to provide an adequate environment to reinstate services.It’s okay to be condemning attacks, but we really do need to see politicians taking leadership on the ground, with these areas that are feeling they need to get themselves involved with these incidents, to feel more stability and security,” he told the BBC’s Good Morning Ulster programme.Mr Conway said attacks had “a lasting effect” on drivers.I speak to bus drivers a lot, particularly drivers who have long service and they always say a hijacking is something they remember for the rest of their service,” he said.We suspended services on around -% of our services, mostly to the north and east of Belfast.

Our bus drivers have chosen to be bus drivers because they want to provide a critical service to their local communities where they live, they absolutely have the right to be able to do that safely and they deserve our respect and gratitude, not to be put under threat.So, as the Minister for Infrastructure, I will do everything I can to ensure that our bus drivers, our train drivers, our passengers are safe.But, for me, I am determined that we will have public transport services in every community in Northern Ireland.I won#t be deterred by these thugs and cowards and I know that our public transport workers won#t either.Ms Mallon said there was an onus on politicians to reduce tensions in loyalist areas over the protocol, rather than whipping up fears with heated rhetoric.It#s about leadership that gives people hope and confidence, instead of instilling fear and hysteria, she said.Ms O#Neill, meanwhile, called on unionist politicians to dial down the noise.

The reality is that I want to know why other areas where there was rioting haven#t been suspended.

We have to put the safety of the drivers first but we need to know how and why Translink make these decisions.He doesn#t know who the protestors are, he said. Anybody carrying out riots or getting involved in riots for any reason, it will not do anything for whatever the protests are or whatever you#re doing. Everybody wants people to protest, they don#t want violence. Desist from it and allow the political process and the legal process sort out what#s going to happen.

That’s not to take away from the safety of drivers who obviously we have to stand behind.The MLA continued: “But at the same time we can’t allow a very small minority of people to disrupt an entire service.”Passengers are being advised to check the Translink website for the latest information, or phone its contact centre on   .Read MoreRathcoole bus hijacking: Four masked men boarded bus carrying hammer and bottle of petrol, police revealRelated topicsPolice Service of Northern IrelandMore On Police Service of Northern IrelandBelfastbus service suspension continues as Translink chief calls for political leadershipCar ploughs into PSNI patrol injuring five officers in CarnloughTranslink assures passengers of safety after UK survey finds violent, sexual behaviour re on public transportCo Armagh school contacts PSNI over Tik Tok video by pupils which contained harmful comments about staff membersWorkers ‘stranded’ as Belfastservices cancelled over fears of attack following latest bus burningMost ReadStrabane woman ‘forgot’ orce in bid to claim husband’s estateDavid Tweed’s daughters reveal the ‘monster’ he really was after years of sexual abuse at hands of late rugby star fatherUnmask ‘paymaster’ to end Kevin Lunney campaign of violence, urges Mannok director McCartinCo Armagh school contacts PSNI over Tik Tok video by pupils which contained harmful comments about staff membersIn profile: The le and crimes of ‘Dublin Jimmy’, the man who orchestrated Kevin Lunney abductionTop VideosPlayWatch: Lockdown has brought more surfers to North Coast PlayReformed former prisoner Rosie Bradley creates artwork for north Belfast cross-community boxing clubPlayVideo: Bus hijacked and burnt in RathcooleLatest Northern IrelandTime to turn mother and baby homes recommendations into action: O’NeillNorthern Ireland Protocol has helped to create , new jobs – Michelle O’NeillNI traffic alerts: Four vehicle crash on M motorway close to Antrim Area HospitalDonaldson: Breakthrough in NI Protocol talks looks unlikelyNorthern Ireland Health and Social Care awards launchedLatestTime to turn mother and baby homes recommendations into action: O’NeillLady Gaga reveals s she went to for House of Gucci characterPeople in Wales to require Covid pass to enter cinemas and theatresHospitality venues set to limit capacity over festive period, MPs toldFran Kirby and Sam Kerr inspire Cha to ruthless win over Servette,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He described the situation as simply atrocious.My office is contacted daily by constituents who have watched on, year after year, as the state of our roads and footways continue to fall into a further state of disrepair after years of neglect. We need to get the basics right and this begins with a road network that’s fit for purpose, he told the Belfast .Failure by the department to bid for more monies this year to fix our roads is just compounding the problem, coupled with the fact £m was handed back in the last year as a result of a lamentable failure to spend on roads resurfacing projects. Serious questions must be answered by the independent investigation currently under way into recent botched roads resurfacing procurement exercise.Just because procurement issues exist in some areas as a result of this mess up is no excuse for the failure to get cracking on sorting roads across Northern Ireland. If anything more works ought to be occurring in unaffected areas whilst work is suspended where.”Mr Muir added that,Northern Ireland is to meet the recommendations set out by highway expert Jim Barton in his  Independent Review into funding road repairs , then DfI needs to take action to ensure money allocated is utilised with plenty of capacity to spend moreavailable.Mr Barton#s review – among other recommendations – called for signicantly increased funding for our road network.Ulster Unionist MLA Andy Allen added: Maintaining our roads and footpaths is an essentialof the Department for Infrastructure and is a service that should be delivered in a timely and effective manner.I have received representations from constituents across east Belfast who continue to raise concerns, not only regarding the delay in potholes or paving road defects being repaired, but also the quality of the maintenance carried out. I will be asking the minister to identy how many repairs have had to be ‘repeated’ or carried out in the same location a number of times in previous years.A Department for Infrastructure spokesperson said: “Minister Mallon will continue to work equitably, as always, across all council areas to improve the condition of the road network for all road users. She is, however, constrained by the level of funding available.“There is a rolling programme of maintenance and repairs across the road network. All roads are inspected on a regular basis and all defects which meet the Department’s current intervention levels are recorded and prioritised for repair. Repairs to potholes are being taken forward on a priority basis, to match the capacity of our internal and external contractors to carry out such repairs.“The opening   structural maintenance capital budget is £m for Northern Ireland. This includes £m for a the ‘road recovery fund’ with £m of this allocated to rural roads, which is a % increase on last year.“Signicant programmes of work have been delivered across all areas in  , in particular on rural roads.”Related topicsAndy AllenAndrew MuirDepartment for InfrastructureMore On Andy Allen PremiumConstruction of , social housing units held up by pandemicLack of an end date reason DUP stalling on welfare mitigation PremiumMore than , Housing Executive tenants vacate homes due to anti-social behaviour in last five years tenants wait over a month for pest control work to be completed PremiumCommunities Minister Hargey keeping quiet over welfare legislationMost ReadStrabane woman ‘forgot’ orce in bid to claim husband’s estateDavid Tweed’s daughters reveal the ‘monster’ he really was after years of sexual abuse at hands of late rugby star fatherUnmask ‘paymaster’ to end Kevin Lunney campaign of violence, urges Mannok director McCartinCo Armagh school contacts PSNI over Tik Tok video by pupils which contained harmful comments about staff membersIn profile: The le and crimes of ‘Dublin Jimmy’, the man who orchestrated Kevin Lunney abductionTop VideosPlayWatch: Lockdown has brought more surfers to North Coast PlayReformed former prisoner Rosie Bradley creates artwork for north Belfast cross-community boxing club\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news de .ece AUTOCROP wh adffbdaefddefcf.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news de .ece AUTOCROP wh adffbdaefddefcf.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayMan and dog struck by a car in west Belfast hit and run Latest Northern IrelandTime to turn mother and baby homes recommendations into action: O’NeillNorthern Ireland Protocol has helped to create , new jobs – Michelle O’NeillNI traffic alerts: Four vehicle crash on M motorway close to Antrim Area HospitalDonaldson: Breakthrough in NI Protocol talks looks unlikelyNorthern Ireland Health and Social Care awards launchedLatestWoman killed in Co Meath crashMeghan acknowledges ‘no politics issue’ while calling for paid parental leaveTime to turn mother and baby homes recommendations into action: O’NeillJonas Eidevall confident Arsenal can compete on all fronts this seasonLady Gaga reveals s she went to for House of Gucci character,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The -year-old was urged by loved ones to go get checked and the results confirmed the devastating news. Anthony, who has resided in Derry for  years, has been diagnosed with Stage  bowel cancer and wants to thank the NHS staff for all their support so far and urges the public to go get symptoms seen to. googletag.cmd.push He said: “If it hadn’t of been for these guys, I wouldn’t have gone to the doctors. I am the kind of guy that would have just ignored it, let it clear itself. All I had was slight stomach cramps and constipation and I let it go for a couple of months. I was just taking tablets to cover it up. “I want people to know you could be covering up something you don’t know is there. It could be nothing but get yourself checked out. “I went to the GP who took bloods and suggested I do a FIT test. The results of the FIT test showed that something wasn’t right and within two weeks I was referred to the Endoscopy unit to have a colonoscopy. “This test showed up something in the bowel. After a week, I got the result that I had bowel cancer. “I received a lot of help and support from the specialist nurses. After that, I had a CT and an ultrasound.” Anthony underwent surgery October  and is currently recovering at home with the support of his we. He continued: “The surgeon kept me informed before and after the surgery. I am still healing now after the surgery it is still very fresh. “They can’t do anything until the wound is healed. Once the wound is healed, there is a possibility I might need chemotherapy, but in tablet form. “I think we got it pretty quick, I don’t know how long its been there. Thetumourwas .cm and they removed cm either side of that as well. The chemo is just to make sure it doesn’t come back again. The bit I hate is not getting out to do stuff and be fit enough to do what I was able to do before, but it’s a process.” Anthony wants to thank the NHS for their ongoing support and the urgency of his treatment. “This whole process started around three months ago and I am sitting here recovering from surgery. Very, very quick.  weeks from my initial appointment to recovering from surgery. “The worst part was waiting the two weeks for the surgery, but that was due to COVID procedures. I went in on the Thursday and came out on the Wednesday. “The theatre staff, nursing staff and all the support staff on the wards were extremely helpful, caring and supportive. After discharge I have been treated really well by the treatment room staff at the health centre as well as the out of hours staff.” Anthony said he can’t praise the NHS enough, “It’s a slow process to recovery but they were so quick with everything they could do. They couldn’t do enough for you. They work so hard. They haven’t got enough staff and still do everything that needs to be done. “Some of the nurses work hourshts and get no break. I can’t understand why they get any negative comments, they’ve been nothing but brilliant to me. “I know it can be hard to get an appointment but the minute I said my symptoms, I was seen to straight away. “The GPS have been most compassionate and supportive.

SDLP Foyle MLA Sineacutead McLaughlin has called for a strategy to be urgently put in place to deal with the rise in drink spiking incidents. googletag.cmd.push Ms McLaughlin said: “The dramatic rise in reported spiking incidents in the last month shows how common this issue has become and how under reported it has been. Since speaking out on this issue I have been contacted by a number of women who have been victims of spiking. It is important that even more people come forward to report possible criminal activities to the PSNI, as well as to tell their story and share their experience so we can best decide how to tackle this issue. “Drink spiking is a horrendous experience for anyone to be subjected to and it can have long-lasting effects. It can destroy someone’s confidence and leave them reluctant to venture out to socialise for fear of being subjected to a similar attack. Spiking places people directly in harm’s way, it greatly affects people’s self-control and leaves them vulnerable to injury and harm. Most disturbingly of all, it can be used to facilitate rape and other forms of sexual assault. “These recent incidents have demonstrated the importance of dealing with spiking as part of the Executive Office’s strategy for addressing violence against women and girls. I will continue to push for urgent action on this issue in my role as Executive Office Committee chair. We need a joined-up approach to ensure that anyone subjected to spiking gets the help and support they need and that perpetrators are appropriately punished to send out a message this is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated in our society.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Spiking places people directly in harm’s way, it greatly affects people’s self-control and leaves them vulnerable to injury and harm. Most disturbingly of all, it can be used to facilitate rape and other forms of sexual assault. “These recent incidents have demonstrated the importance of dealing with spiking as part of the Executive Office’s strategy for addressing violence against women and girls. I will continue to push for urgent action on this issue in my role as Executive Office Committee chair. We need a joined-up approach to ensure that anyone subjected to spiking gets the help and support they need and that perpetrators are appropriately punished to send out a message this is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated in our society.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Cllr Harkin, who represents the Foyleside ward, was speaking after Saturdays Global Day of Action rally in Derry where many turned out to march – in unison with other world cities – to send a message to politicians that too little is being done to halt climate change. googletag.cmd.push Many figures from the Executive parties in Stormont have commented on how environmental changes need to be enforced to curb rising temperatures that could have a disastrous effect on the world with many land area at risk of being submerged by rising sea levels. However, Harkin claims such talk is nothing more than hot air and that politicians need to make good on their words with action. He said: “We commend all those who joined climate action now rallies in Derry and Belfast, across Ireland and across the world yesterday. “It was a powerful global day of action in defiance of the superficial proposals of elites gathered in Glasgow at COP. “All five of the Stormont Executive parties ran to the exclusionary Glasgow conference to join the political establishment in an attempt to showcase their newly found environmental credentials. “As Greta Thunberg said its been more blah blah blah from elites. “Rather than acting as a protector, the Executive has spent the last two decades doing immense damage to our environment. “What the Stormont Executive parties say and do is very dferent. “Just months ago the SDLP Minister for Infrastructure rammed through continued corporate gouging of Lough Neagh over the opposition of environmental campaigners. “The entire Executive allowed the DUP to run riot with the climate destroying going for growth agribusiness strategy for over a decade. “Sinn Feacutein and others said nothing because profits were high and it was good for elites. The same inaction is true for the RHI cash for ash debacle. “The same action gap is clear when it comes expanding rail and public transportation. “The lack of urgency from the DfI Minister means it could be a decade before the Derry rail upgrade happens –at all. And there are constant threats to slash funding for public transportation in order to open it up to privatisation. “The same inaction applies to cleaning up the toxic Mobuoy dump, air quality and toxic mining in the Sperrins. “There are real solutions to address the climate crisis. This requires challenging capitalisms drive for profit no matter what the consequences are for communities and nature. “The political establishment in the Stormont Executive, the Daacuteil and Westminster are not up for this because it means challenging elites, challenging inequality and challenging the status quo. “If Stormont manages to finally pass a Climate Act, the Executive cannot be trusted to ensure even its limited goals will be acted on. “We need a real alternative to the bluff and bluster of the Stormont Executive parties. People power is the key to seeing real action on climate change that can deliver a green transition protecting workers and making sure no one is left behind.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Padraig Delargy, Cllr Sandra Duffy and Cllr Emma McGinley are also in attendance.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Nov Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Foyle Sinn Feacutein MLA Ciara Ferguson has launched a blistering attack on Environment Minister, Edwin Poots, demanding he “end his dithering and delaying and his half hearted approach to tackling the global emergency”. As the COP conference looking at climate change enters its second week in Glasgow, Ms Ferguson said that more should be done by the Executive to show that the North of Ireland is playing its part in halting the rise in climate temperature. googletag.cmd.push She stressed the need for progressive views to come to the fore at Stormont and that Mr Poots, who once served as DUP leader for three weeks, should step up to the plate and push through “ambitious legislation” on climate change. Ms Ferguson said: “It’s important across the globe that we send a strong message to world leaders that there must be immediate and decisive action to deal with our climate emergency. “This is a global crisis that requires a global solution, and everyone has a role to play in halting catastrophic climate change. “The DUP minister responsible for the environment is dithering and delaying on climate action and his approach has been at best half-hearted. That’s unacceptable.  Northern Ireland Executive Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Edwin Poots “Civic society, environmental groups, legal experts have come together along with progressive political parties and politicians to shape and launch our own climate bill. “Hopefully these progressive views will translate into a majority for real action on the floor of the Assembly. “The North needs ambitious legislation and it needs it before the end of this political mandate in April. “We need net zero targets which enable our businesses, agriculture, infrastructure and energy providers to plan for the future in a transformative way for our society and its population that creates opportunities for green economic growth and jobs. “But we can leave no inidual, community or sector behind in our pursuit of a sustainable future for ourselves and those that come behind us. Nor can we cannot expect the least well off or the vulnerable to pay the cost. “The climate crisis must be tackled on the premise – and with the promise of a just transition. “The climate emergency recognises no borders and we must respond with an all Ireland approach to the climate emergency. That is just common sense.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The measure means that all essential frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month period. googletag.cmd.push This announcement has come as a huge relief and means these local workers and their families have a signicant degree of protection in the event they are unable to attend work due to ill health and reflects the importance of being in a trade union. Along with this new contractual improvement, UNISON trade union representatives working in Apex also successfully negotiated a Covid- recognition payment for all frontline workers. Niall McCarroll of UNISON said: “This recognition agreement between UNISON and Apex Housing Association has only become a reality as a direct result of local workers joining UNISON, becoming active in their workplace and organising towards achieving better working conditions and improved pay and terms and conditions of employment. “Local trade union members mobilising with the support of their union and changing the very ethos and culture across their place of work. “Across Apex Housing Association there are currently  workers in UNISON with workplace reps, health and safety reps and workplace contacts operating across the entire workforce, providing support and expertise when the need arises with the focus being, to leave no worker feeling isolated whilst building up a culture of solidarity, strength through a genuine unity of purpose. “There is much still to achieve within Apex Housing Association but with the growing numbers of workers joining UNISON, it will only be a matter of time before UNISON and Apex deliver on the outstanding issues. I would encourage any local worker employed in the Community and Voluntary Sector to make contact with UNISON Community Branch. “Together we can make positive changes in your workplace and begin the process of you being valued for the work you complete within the community. “Do not let any employer tell you there is no point in being in a trade union.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Mr Doyle, who represents the Ballyarnett ward, said that people needed to see “a concrete commitment from Ulster University about Magees expansion”. His remarks come after the Vice-Chancellor, Paul Bartholomew, conceded that the aim of having , students at Magee College was not feasible with  being a more realistic target. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Doyle spoke in Octobers monthly meeting of Derry City  Strabane District Council in favour of inviting Galway-based National University of Irelandto help assist Ulster University in expanding Magees numbers – a motion that was voted down by Council. “The expansion of Magee saga has gone on too long and establishment parties are in a flap about what exactly their position is,” said Cllr Doyle. “In my time as an elected representative the one thing that has been clear is that commitment of partners right across the city to demonstrate long term planning for the city even without finances in place. “I am very concerned about the recent developments around Magee. Firstly the Vice Chancellor tells us on the record that the most we can hope for in terms of Magee student numbers is . “Then Sinn Feacutein, the SDLP, DUP and UUP block a proposal at Council to even speak to the NUI about Magee’s future. “People need to see a concrete commitment from Ulster University about Magee’s expansion. If, for example, the Department for the Economy allocated Ulster University more student places tomorrow, we would have no guarantees that Magee would benefit. “Therefore I am calling on senior leadership within the University to create an ‘Expansion Unit’ within the Vice Chancellor’s Office to specically research, plan and implement into Ulster University’s corporate planning how Magee can grow. They have specic resources in place for Brexit, so this is no dferent. “If confidence is to be built around the partnership with Ulster University for the city deal then I believe this is a prudent and demonstrable action that can help us move forward and I will be re-iterating this to the Vice-Chancellor in the coming weeks.” In response, a spokesperson for Ulster University said: “During the Derry City and Strabane Strategic Growth partnership meeting, Vice-Chancellor Professor Paul Bartholomew extended an open invitation to discuss in depth the university’s commitment and plans with councillors in person – this invitation is open to Cllr Emmet Doyle.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.     Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Reporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Institute  Dergview  It was another opportunity missed for Institute as they could only draw with Dergview at the Brandywell. It is now seven games without a win for ‘Stute who overcame a half time deficit, but despite some good chances, could not turn the game in their favour. A ‘Stute mistake gave Derview the lead early on. Goalkeeper John Connolly yelled for his defender to leave it as Cathal Farren’s cross came in, but he dropped the ball straight into the path of the league’s top scorer Benny Igiehon, wo simply put the ball into the empty net to make it -. googletag.cmd.push It should have gotten worse for the home side on the half hour when Niall McGinley broke down the left, and he picked out Farren in the middle, but the former Derry City striker scuffed his effort wide of the target with just Connolly to beat. The home side were thrown a leline just before the hour mark when they were awarded a penalty. A cross into the Dergview box found Aaron McGurk, whose touch took the ball away from him. Both McLaughlin and goalkeeper Buchanan went for the loose ball and it looked asthe goalkeeper got there first, but not according to referee Harrigan, who pointed to the spot. Dergview were baffled by the decision, but after their protests, McLaughlin kept his calm to score his first goal in  games and his th for the season overall to make it -. ‘Stute had a great chance to take the lead in the game for the first time on  minutes when McGurk did well to work his way into the area, and although his shot was blocked, the ball fell out of the sky right onto the foot of McLaughlin, who volleyed wide with the whole goal to aim at. Those missed chances almost cost ‘Stute as Dergview began to get on top for the first time in the second half as the game entered the final ten minutes. Jamie Browne had his head in his hands after he dispossessed Jamie Dunne just outside his own area, but the striker was denied at the last second by the ‘Stute man, who made amends by deflecting the shot behind for a corner. From that set-piece, ‘Stute were lucky to survive as the ball bounced around the area, and it took a few brave blocks to keep the ball from reaching Connolly’s goal with Dergview players lining up to put it in.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Michael McMullan Nov Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, Relief. That was Hugh McGrath’s take on finally getting over the line as Steelstown won their first Intermediate title at last.He admitted it wasn’t this side’s best showing of the season. Nor were they cohesive. And they didn’t play the brand of football they wanted. But there was only one currency Steelstown were dealing in. Silverware. That’s all Saturday was about.“It just matters that you are ahead at the end of the game,” said McGrath.“I wasn’t nervous in any way,” he told his side before the club’s historic hour. “I was jealous that they got to get the chance to go out and show what they were worth and show what was inside them.”And, coming back from last season’s defeat and in the manner which they did, that – in McGrath’s opinion – is the Steelstown’s calling card.“It tells you all you need to know about the group,” he said.The burden of three final defeats didn’t come into the narrative. It was a new management team, with a sprinkling of new players.At dferent times this year, McGrath beat the drum of a new beginning. Donncha Gilmore is now an All-Ireland winner. Five championships goals later, Morgan Murray has arrived on the scene and like Oran Fox, he benefitted from a league campaign that McGrath treated as gloried friendlies.It wasn’t about hard luck stories or flashbacks from yesteryear.“All we could base any chat around was what we done this year so far,” McGrath again stressed.“We were confident that we’d get ourselves in enough positions to take chances, that we’d create enough chances to get ourselves over the line.“We knew it would be tough, you don’t play the champions and get it easy. We knew it would be tough all the way through and it was about grinding it out.”Points from Jason McAleer and Eoghan Bradleyhad Steelstown three points clear after eight minutes, but the sides were levelat the break.“We weren’t panicking because we knew these things happen,” insisted the Steelstown boss. We went a couple down at the start of the second half. Maybe there was a bit of panic and you are going to feel that pressure when you have a couple of forwards like Greenlough have.”But McGrath trusted their leaders. Skipper Forester. Impact man Mickey McKinney. Midfielder Ryan Devine. All players from the  minor team he coached when he arrived at the club.“You have confidence that you have a group that will drive you on and get you over the line and that’s the way it panned out,” McGrath said.The fact they were still at the coal face of their title bid spoke volumes. McKinney was crying with total elation. “Is this real ”, bellowed Forester amid the pandemonium.“To go so long until now, it shows the type of characters that they are. They hung in there and had the belief in the group that was coming behind them,” McGrath added.“They are emotional. It shows how much the clubs means to them they have a desire to win.”And on the weekend that marked the thanniversary of Brian Oacuteg McKeever’s death. The club now carries his name.For McGrath, the final quarter told the story of the McKeever family.“That’s the way he would’ve played his game. If you look at the way Neildrove out, Eoghan Concannon hammered everything that was near him.“That was Brian Oacuteg McKeever, that’s what he did and there are plenty around here that know that’s what he did.“They were part of him, they saw him do it and the young people coming through are now aware of it too.”“He is never too far from our thoughts and Charleneas well, she played exactly the same way. For us to be able to do this for the McKeever family and give them something to celebrate, we are proud do to that.” googletag.cmd.push ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

I was going to talk about the NI Music Prize when the predictable happens and rant on deaf ears about the unfairness of it all, but I continually vote in it, and it has been quite spot-on in the past, so, maybe I might wise up. Probably not like.

There hasn’t been enough gigs this past year to have a best live act, how they arrived at a conclusion last year is strange but then I may be misinformed. There’s obviously no new bands to speak of so it’s just the two awards this year. I suppose it’s as close to democracy as we can get, but as with everything in the parish, the archaic powers that be hold way too much influence and are too stuck in the past. I’m the guiltiest and have no real business having a say and will keep my opinions to myself from now on. Well after I say that to my ears Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won are the best albums on that list to me and Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government is the best single. I think we should all sit back and appreciate that Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave was recently up for the Mercury Music Prize kiss of death, sadly not winning butit was two out of two losses an outsider would be thinking that there is something really weird going on within the chambers of power up at the Oh Yeah Centre. I named the  nominators to remind myself that my taste really isn’t that important, and I should read my above statement about keeping my opinions to myself. Waiting for things to change in the parish is just something we are great at here. What next, I hear you ask, well there is a group that meets around a table and weighs up the options for the best albums, I’d like to think they do this in a fair manner and once they reach a consensus then the world, who will undoubtedly be waiting with bated breath, will get their answer The same is not true for the single, that is voted for by the public, you, and that’s why those bands were urging you to vote recently. The public vote is now closed so I suppose they know who’s won it by now but they’re not letting on. Rascals.

Here are  to choose from....enjoy! Miami Vice: Saturday, TCM @ pm Michael Manns stylish and action packed update of the famous s TV show about cops taking on drug dealers. Bristling with testosterone, its a moody grown up thriller full of suspense, action and neo-nazis getting shot in the face. Whats not to like about that  Colin Farrell  Jamie Foxx are solid as the leads but Naomie Harris steals the film with one small scene in a mobile home. The soundtrack is wicked too. googletag.cmd.push Portrait Of A Lady On Fire: Saturday, BBC @ pm In Brittany at the end of the th century a painter called Marianne is commissioned to paint a portrait of a woman calledHeacuteloiumlse who is due to be married off to an Italian nobleman. A marriage she wants no part of. Do you fancy a romance that will both uplt you and leave you in absolute shreds  Well here you go. Magnicent turns from Noeacutemie Merlant and Adegravele Haenel carry a sublime story. Rain Man: Saturday, TG @ .pm Charlies father has died and left his fortune to an autistic brother he never realised he had. To get the money him and his brother tear off on a road trip where he finds out about both his sibling and himself. Aspects of Rain Man have dated these days but its still a lovely story of discovery and reunion buoyed by a couple of memorable performances from Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Pawn Sacrice: Sunday, BBC One @ .am  Bobby Fischer vs Boris Spassky. . The chess game to end all chess games. Two grandmasters. West vs East. Some said it was only a game but in a time of cold war its also something far more important than that. Tobey Maguire does fine work as the tragic lead of a well crafted film riddled with paranoia and suspense while Liev Schrieber uses his trademark brooding to intense effect. Walk Like A Panther: Sunday, Channel  @ .am  Their local pub is closing and the only way to make money is toto the lycra and capes. But these folks arent superheroes, nope, they are s wrestlers and aching hips and shoulders arent going to stop them. An entertaining slice of fluff and whimsy from  that will make you feel nostalgic for Saturday morning television. Stephen Graham, Sue Johnston, Robbie Gee and Julian Sands are among the familiar faces having fun. Ladyhawke: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm Nare and Isabeau are in love but they have a wee problem. There was a curse placed on them making him a wolf during the night and her a hawk during the day ensuring they can never be together. The only person who can help is a thief called Gaston. Richard Donners  fairytale is a likable, well made, glorious looking romantic escapade. Michelle Pfefer and Rutger Hauer play the lost lovers and Matthew Broderick has a good time as their only hope. St Vincent: Sunday, Film @ .pm After an incident with his next door neighbour a grumpy old Vietnam vet begins to babysit her bullied son and soon they begin to see the best in each other. A funny, bittersweet comedy that will make you laugh and upset you in equal measures. Bill Murray in the lead is better than hes been in years and Melissa McCarthy as his neighbour does well in a role thats a lot more dramatic than her usual parts. Bridge to Terabithia: Monday, Great! Films @ .pm Jesse and Leslie become fast friends when she moves in next door to him. Soon their childhood imaginations are running riot and the kingdom of Terabithia is created. Real le is sadly never far away though. A little beaut of a movie, one full of lessons about le, both the lovely and tragic sides of it. Anna Sophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both amiable leads. Be warned, this could might will make you cry. Doubt: Monday, TG @ .pm A well liked priest is accused of child abuse. But did he do it  Thats the crux of the tale in an excellent adaption of the famous Broadway play. Philip Seymour Hoffmanis the priest in question and Meryl Streep is the nun investigating him. We get immense performances from both. The subject matter might be hard to take but its compelling and gripping stuff that will stay in your head for days after. Dog Soldiers: Monday, Film @ . A group of soldiers on routine training in the Scottish highlands find themselves under siege from a pack of beasts that should not exist. Neil Marshalls debut film is awesome. Hilarious, horric, quotable, disgusting and damn scary. A rare horror comedy that gets its blend just right. All this and we get a wicked cast too with Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd, Liam Cunningham and Darren Morfitt whos just deadly as Spoon. All The Kings Men: Tuesday, Great! Movies Action @ .am Wille Stark. A real salt of the earth fellow. Liked by all. Well...... Hes a politician, a self taught kind of guy. Hes a decent man, at least he was once, back when he hadnt sold his soul. A deserved Best Picture winner back in , this portrait of the rise and fall of a famous face mixes politics and noir to brilliant effect.Broderick Crawfordand Merceded McCambridge both put in first rate performances. Journeys End: Wednesday, BBC Two @ .pm France. . The trenches of Aisne. A young soldier called Raleigh once who once believed in the importance of war sits surrounded by his comrades in a filthy, rat infested trench as the German army only metres away get ready to attack their front lines. A powerful watch that shows us bullets make no distinctions when it comes to class and social status. Asa Butterfield, Paul Bettany and Sam Clafin do strong work. Nebraska: Thursday, Film @ .am A father and son called Woody and David are taking a trip from Montana to Nebraska to claim a prize. Woody is slowly losing his memory to dementia and David is dragged into the mess. Alexander Paynes comedy drama is a beautully written and crafted look at the complexities of family relationships. Plus it has a couple of wicked belly laughs hidden away. Bruce Dern, Will Forte and especially June Squibb are all on fire. Paths Of Glory: Thursday, BBC @ .pm The men of B-company refuse to make a suicidal run at a German hill during World War . Their general is embarrassed by his perceived failure and sets out to make someone pay. Stanley Kubricks masterful anti war film is an enraging watch, one that shows the toll military le can have on humanity even when the fighting is over. Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax has never been better while George Macready as General Mireau will make you despair. Sam Whiskey: Friday, TG @ .pm Her husband is dead and Laura has a problem. The gold he stole is sitting in a boat at the bottom of the Colorado river and she needs someone to find it andit to its rightful place. Unfortunately she hires the rogue Sam Whiskey for the job. A charming. amiable western is just what you need for a Friday evening and this one led by Burt Reynolds and Angie Dickinson is just the ticket. Youll instantly guess how its going to end but it will keep you smiling throughout. American Mary: Friday, The Horror Channel @ .pm A broke medical student discovers an unusual way to make extra money and finds herself in some very very dark places as a result. This  dark drama horror film starring Katherine Isabelle is a highly effective piece of work. Be warned though, it should probably only be watched by those with a strong constitution butyou can go with it you discover a unique little story that will open your eyes to a whole other world. The Belly Of The Whale: Friday, RTEacute One @ .pm Joe and Ronald. Two loners in a miserable, run down seaside town in Donegal. One has come home after a long time and the other is already there scratching out a miserable existence. They come together with a plan but theres someone venal in their way. A dark dark dark Irish comedy from  that went under the radar at the time but its still worth your time. Michael Smiley, Peter Coonan and Pat Shortt do nice work as three men youd cross four fields to avoid.

We wanted to celebrate that and also remember our dear friend and past pupil, Sonia Kinsella, who died of cancer last year.ldquoWhen we think of her strength and her courage and more importantly, her optimism, this play seemed so appropriate. We hope it pays tribute to Sonia as I think the sentiments this play evokes were embodied in that remarkable lady.ldquoThe play celebrates the strength of female friendship and the incredible support women experience from each other. I think our audiences will find themselves laughing one minute and crying the next.I am so proud of what has been achieved not only in the fact we havenrsquot fallen out despite the dficulties you face when you are trying to work with friends but also the time these busy women have devoted to learning lines and rehearsing while working full time and coping with family responsibilities. It has been hard work but I truly feel audiences will really enjoy the performance.Proceeds from the performances will be in aid of Marie Curie and Assumption Grammar Schoolrsquos sister schools in South Africa.Marcelle said: ldquoThese schools struggle financially anyway but they are experiencing great challenges during lockdown. The money we raise will make a huge dference to many lives there, allowing girls to get access to education and to be offered a meal each day.The provision offered to these students in South Africa can make all the dference to their future.She added: It is wonderful to see the fruition of all our hard work that all stemmed from a conversation during lockdown and that will hopefully benefit others in dferent ways.To purchase a ticket the production, please contact the school reception on   .

The website is now live. It is www.redkiteretreat and we are regularly updating our Facebook page @redkiteretreat. For more information please pay us a visit on Facebook, like and share the page.Red Kites were in the area and over a year ago and Stephen started feeding them and as this continued more and more started turning up daily.Red Kites are a bird of prey and have a huge wingspan of up to . metres they are reddish brown with black wingtips and a grey head.They have a distinctive V-shaped tail which they use like a rudder as they twist and turn through the air on thermals and their call is a long whistle.Red Kites are primarily scavengers and a big part of their diet is made up of dead animals , including road-kill. They also follow tractors when ploughing and swoop down to grab any small animals that have been killed by the mowers or brought to the surface.They are no threat to livestock and the largest animal they have the power and speed to kill is a young rabbit. Red Kites, like all other birds of prey, are protected by law and to harm, disturb or kill them is a criminal offence.The new Red Kite Retreat bird hide has already become very popular with wildle photographers and bird watchers and booking a slot is essential.Three generations of the Malcomson family have also helped to plant some of the first of , native trees on a -acre site to create The Warriorrsquos Wood on Dechomet Mountain.The main contractor, Scottish Woodland Ireland Ltd, managed the forest expansion and farm ersication project and planted Irish Oak, Hazel, Holly, Scots Pine and Downy Birch. Stephen and Karen also created two new ponds to encourage wildle and sowed a new wildflower meadow.Warriorrsquos Wood is the initial habitat enhancement works which form part of the new eco-tourism development known as the lsquoRed Kite Retreatrsquo.Stephen and Karen are the projectrsquos co-founders and wanted a means of ersying their farm business to ensure future sustainability.Currently, Stephen has a pig and beef unit on the farm but said ldquofarming enterprises have to adapt and evolve to ensure sustainability for future generations of farmers. I see no reason why modern farming practices cannot go hand in hand with conservation, environmental enrichment and encouraging bioersity.The Red Kite Retreat project aims to create a unique tourist and visitor facility and focuses on conservation and education about the Red Kite bird of prey, with the creation of the Warriorrsquos Wood the first step in the project.The Wood has been designed to mimic ancient woodland with species adapted to grow in elevated and exposed locations, with the planting including Scots pine, oak, birch, aspen, rowan, hawthorn and juniper.The Scots pine is favoured by native red squirrels which it is hoped will be reintroduced once the woodland has matured, while Juniper is also being established on the site.Updates in the Red Kite retreat are available on Facebook @redkiteretreat, by logging on at www.redkiteretreat or telephone .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_espie.jpg","title":"Castle Espie receives plaudit  ","story":"THE Castle Espie Wetland Centre on the shores of Strangford Lough, which recently hosted the popular BBC wildle programme Autumnwatch, has been praised for its ongoing conservation work.Ards and North Down deputy mayor Robert Adair visited the centrersquos base recently and met BBC programme presenter Gillian Burke and Castle Espie manager Paul Stewart.Cllr Adair said after the huge success of Springwatch at Castle Espie, the television programmersquosfor Autumnwatch has shone the spotlight on the rich wildle of the borough and Castle Espie as an icon of sustainable green tourism.In addition to hosting Autumnwatch, the visit comes as the charity is currently celebrating with a Winter Migration Festival at Castle Espie which includes a series of bespoke events for adults and children alike and runs until November .Cllr Adair said the international importance of Strangford Lough and its exceptional bioersity is a real asset to the environment.ldquoCastle Espie provides a window on the lough with the Winter Migration Festival and filming of Autumnwatch being a fitting way to introduce people to this wonderful asset on our doorstep, he added.Mr Stewart said the centre has been celebrating the natural resource and theof the Brent geese with events in and around Autumnwatch aimed at connecting people with nature.ldquoFrom sunrise yoga, art workshops, walks and talks, to nature focused activities for children, they are all aimed at connecting people to this wonderful place, he explained.ldquoThe worldrsquos wetland habitats like those at Castle Espie actually sequester more carbon than all the worldrsquos forests despite occupying only a fraction of the area around the globe.ldquoAs well as helping to deal with the effects of climate change, wetlands are one of the most bioerse habitats on Earth, protect us from flooding, filter pollutants and help improve our mental health.The Wildle and Wetlands Trust works around the globe, protecting wetland habitats and migratory bird flyways and operates  wetland centres across the UK with Castle Espie the only one in Northern Ireland.The charity recently launched a new lsquoWetlands Can!rsquo campaign, urging people to get behind the leading conservation charityrsquos call for creating , hectares of healthy wetlands in the UK to help combat the climate crisis.Mr Stewart added: ldquoIf the Covid crisis has taught us one thing, itrsquos that we canrsquot go back to how things were before.

Both were using the course as practice for the more competitive All-Ireland races coming up in the middle of November.Alex Robinson ran in the U- race which was two loops of the one-mile course. He ran very well and held onto fourth place for most of the race, just ping to fth on the final turn.

Oliver finished third boy overall. Well done to both lads for continuously keeping the East Down name to the fore, week in week out.EDAC member Patrick Smith also made the long trip to Bangor on Saturday to take part in the gloriously titled North Down Festival of Cross Country Running, just to try it out.Although he was the sole EDAC representative, he soon settled into a good rhythm, despite the very tricky underfoot conditions brought about by heavy overnight rain, which almost flies in the face of the seemingly never ending forecasts of impending global warming doom.He was only running to have a go at cross country, since all his club colleagues had been fulsome in their praise for last weekendrsquos races in Comber, and also to re-kindle the love for the genre, some  years after his last attempt.So without over exerting himself and drinking in the applause of the spectators, he finished in a highly respectable . and th place in a high quality field.Despite Patrick being unduly critical of his performance, he had finished the course in what is a pretty good time for a cross country race.

He said the local company, which is the largest private employer in the Killyleagh area, regrets that after two yearsrsquo growth, it has been necessary to lay off staff.The spokesman said evenit had not been for the events in America on September , there has been an unfortunate downturn in the leather clothing business.ldquoAs a result of reduced orders, it has been necessary to take this short term step and we would stress these are lay-offs not redundancies and we remain optimistic about the future, the spokesman added.DOWNPATRICK ndash A vandalism attack on the GPrsquos emergency vehicle placed patientsrsquo lives across the district at risk last week.Doctors have revealed that had the Pound Lane attack in Downpatrick not been spotted by paramedics based at the Downe Hospital, the consequences for patients could have been fatal.Two tyres on the special car used by GPs belonging to the DowneDoc GP co-operative were slashed during the early hours of Thursday morning in an attack described as a ldquofrightening new development.The emergency vehicle, which is packed with vital medical equipment, was targeted outside the Pound Lane Health Clinic sometime between .am and .am. The manager of the local service has confirmed that the incident is the first deliberate attack against an on-call GP service in Northern Ireland in the past five years.Mr Mark Armstrong described the Downpatrick attack as a ldquofrightening new development because the vandals deliberately put the emergency car off the road by puncturing both tyres.He also confirmed an immediate review of security has been ordered in the wake of the attack to ensure it does not happen again and that patients lives are not put at risk.SEAFORDE ndash Criminals have once again targeted a family-owned business on the Newcastle to Seaforde Road.Police are investigating the most recent attack on Brennanrsquos service station during which a car rammed into the front of the building on Thursday evening, causing damage estimated at several thousand pounds.Just a few week ago a Securicor van parked outside the garage was also targeted by thieves.Those responsible for the most recent incident made off in their vehicle without taking anything from the premises.It is understood that they were attempting to access a cash machine inside the building but were disturbed before they got to the machine.Councillor Patsy Toman said people throughout the community were ldquodisgusted that the McKibbenrsquos family business had been targeted.ldquoThis family is working hard to serve the district and they have installed the cash machine as a service to local people which some think was the target for last weekrsquos attack, he said.ldquoIt would be a real pitythis cash machine had to be removed to stop vandals attacking the store.DRUMANESS ndash Drunken vandals ran amok in a night of horric Halloween violence in Drumaness last week.Parts of the village were vandalised as the teenagers, some of whom were brandishing fireworks, terrorised residents in the village on Wednesday night.The situation was so bad that local politicians and police were called to speak with teenagers in a bid to quell the trouble and a number of parents were also contacted to take their children home.Local councillor, Mr Patsy Toman, said many people were disgusted at the behaviour of the teenagers, many of whom he claimed were fuelled by alcohol they had bought illegally.Mr Toman, who was called to the village along with Down Council chairwoman, Mrs Anne McAleenan, said the widespread hooliganism and violence has no place in Drumaness and hopes the situation will not be repeated.He said young children and elderly people were terried as the teenagers ran amok and claimed the damage to property was widespread.ldquoThe majority of the teenagers responsible for the trouble were tanked up on illegal alcohol they had purchased and there is a real underage drinking problem in Drumaness which has to be addressed, he said.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Northern Ireland Electricity will invest pound, on improvements to the Ballynahinch network over the next six months.NIE officials have confirmed that the

for electricity.CROSSGAR ndash Roads Service officials have been urged to do all they can to secure additional finance to allow further improvements on the main Crossgar to Saintfield Road.The call was issued at a special meeting of Down Council on Monday night when the districtrsquos senior roads chief revealed work on a current pound, realignment scheme is expected to be completed ahead of

Newcastle last week.The fire, at the public toilets in the Islandrsquos car park off the Bryansford Road, was discovered by a passer-by at .pm on Friday night.Local fire crews attended the scene, but the blaze was already well underway and the building, which was installed as part of a major Down Council scheme just four years ago, was gutted.Describing the fire as ldquototally senseless, council

I did so because my mum Marilyn has had liver cancer for the last three years.Alistair said that the Boston Marathon was quite an emotional event for him this time due to his motherrsquos illness.ldquoI ran as part of a charity team with  people from all over the States and some other international runners and I got to hear why other people were running and their situations as well.The overall time effort was raising , which will go into medical research.Alistair has raised thousands more for other charities, such as Barnardorsquos, from his running.He felt that running the marathon was not as challenging as actually getting to Boston.Alistair explained: ldquoThere was lots of training without knowingit would even happen, waiting and hoping the US border would open to allow travel and when it didnrsquot in time, I had to convince the US Consulate in Belfast to grant me a special exemption to travel, so there were lots of hurdles to overcome on this journey.Alistairrsquos achievements are all the more impressive since he only took up running nearly six years ago.ldquoI decided to take up running for fitness and I used a couch to K running app on my phone.

Hynds produced a peerless display aside from that concession, a former Poc Fada competitor, her restarts were struck with precision to wing forwards Katie Black and Niamh Galloway, who in turn fed team captain Joanne Sloane.Straight away, Sloane would angle deliveries into the mobile Maguire. Sloanersquos slick stickwork was impressive, and she had a fine contest versus Bernie Convery throughout.The key battle however, was the dual between Dearg centre back Grainne Glendenning and Belfastrsquos Jessica Rush.With her luminous green boots and helmet, Rush would stand out in any game, but she has the class to back up the bright colours.Winning a huge amount of primary possession, Jessica lsquos jinking, probing runs and vision to find Nicole Clerkin and Niamh Dolan was causing huge headaches for an experienced Ben Dearg defence.Kilcliefrsquos breakthrough goal came in the th minute with Burns finishing brilliantly past Lara OrsquoHare.Clare Kelly and Aacuteine Moynan made timely and brave blocks from Nora Maguirersquos goalbound efforts. The midfield battle was an intriguing and crucial one.Dual star Cara Doran has been on a scoring spree in the football championship this year and she continued her hot streak, with some exceptionally well taken scores from tight angles.Eimear Dorrian was everywhere, covering every blade of grass, never static, always roving, trying to create and make things happen. Dorrianrsquos dynamism and Doranrsquos deadliness contributed hugely to the green and reds display.Niamh McGuigan produced an equally impressive display for the Belfast side. McGuiganrsquos magnetic ability to gain possession in the tightest of spaces is remarkable.Never rushed, despite the chaos around her, she has that precarious talent of always having time, allowing her to scan and assess options, a luxury that only the very top operatorrsquos have.All season, Niamh Daly has also operated at centre field, but cruelly missed out on this final through injury.Brigid Scullion cleverly ped deep to forage for possession, picking up loose ball and linking well with half backs McErlain and Mathers. Kilclief thundered into action with another brace of points from deadly Doran.Her score in the st minute was worthy of the admission fee. Still only  years of age, a career in county colours surely beckons for this gted youngGael.Eimear Breen was a constant outlet for her defence to hit, a player who uses her pace effectively at the right times.With  minutes remaining, Kilclief were edging the contest with a five point cushion. Management Brendan Breen and Seaacuten Paul Doran madetactical tweaks to thwart the increasingly dangerous Clerkin and Dolan axis up front.A double sweeper system was swtly put in place, Cliona Shields and Catherine Deegan were tasked with shutting up shop forming a highly effective shield in front of Ballinascreen stalwart Nicole Clerkin.Nicolersquos space was greatly reduced, but still she battled as hard as possible to cut the deficit. McMullan and Mastersonrsquos masterclass in creating space for goalkeeper Hynds to aim towards, were signicant.McMullan typied the fight and character within the Ben Dearg outfit, as did the industrious Catherine Deegan. Yet, East Belfast pressed with an astounding intensity and relentlessness.That huge work rate comes from having dual players with fierce commitment and blocks of fitness from constant competing, but also from their Bainisteoiriacute Ciaran Hughes and Seaacuten Coulter who encourage their team to play with flair, and they certainly do that, but intense work ethic is paramountyou are to retain a place in this highly motivated team.That competition for places has ensured consistent performance levels all season.Niamh Dolan cleverly created precious space in the congested final third in the th minute, but her angled drive was superbly blocked by Cliona Shields, then swept up bravely by the heroic McMullan, who swtly transitioned to the always available Dorrian.Testament to the synchronisity that is within this Ben Dearg side, Dorrian didnrsquot have to look up to spot the expertly timed run of Burns who showed a deftness of touch to control the sliotar and sail it straight over the black spot.It was a score that comes from playing training together over many seasons. At the other end Aacuteine Moynan and Shannon McWilliams made important blocks, just as Joanne Sloan and Niamh Galloway were about to raise green flags.Clodagh Hanvey made a strong contribution after entering the fray. Maguirersquos maturity and decision making is exceptional for a Gael just turned .With Cara Doran the same age, the future is bright for this Kilclief team. Breen too, displays a shrewd tactical brain, dropping into spaces, covering runs, causing havoc.Doran was awarded player of the match, for her scintillating display, though a case could also have been made for East Belfastrsquos Niamh McGuigan.Niamhrsquos link up play with Jessica Rush was a joy to watch, but equally impressive was her willingness to help team mates in trouble, a true team player.With both teams featuring strong and dynamic forward units, this game was always going to be decided by which defence came out on top.Ultimately, the craft, guile and experience of the Kilclief reargaurd ensured that they closed the game out and got the Championship title they so craved, especially after last yearrsquos heartbreaking defeat to Attical.Euphoric scenes and emotions were unleashed as referee HP McCusker blew his final whistle.Team captain Joanne Sloane spoke from the heart, with a speech that did her club proud. A huge roar went up from the Ben Dearg support whenever she lted aloft the Liam Mac An Ri championship trophy.Each age group at juvenile and now senior level has collected silverware this season, testament to the solid work taking place at their fantastic new facilities in St Malachyrsquos Park.Lorraine MacCartanrsquos priceless contribution in the development of players at the club was highlighted, and deserved praise was duly given to this exemplary East Belfast side.The Ulster Championships now beckon for Kilclief.Referee: H P McCusker .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_kilmore.jpg","title":"Kilmore navigate their way past Maze  ","story":"KILMORE Rec welcomed Lower Maze to Robert Adams Park in the third round of the Peaky Blinders Irish Cup and produced a barn storming second half comeback to progress to round four.With Kilmore two goals down at half-time, having been harshly reduced to ten men after  minutes, the odds were stacked against them.However, a tactical change and a second half performance full of hard work and passion epitomised by man of the match Paddy Grant saw Michael Carvillrsquos men defy those odds and produce one of the most memorable comebacks seen at Robert Adams Park in recent times.Kilmore started brightly but after just eight minutes they failed to clear their lines from a corner, allowing Lower Mazersquos Alex Scott to pick up the ball  yards out and fire through a crowded goal mouth past an unsighted Chris Turley in the Kilmore goals.The task in hand got harder when the referee adjudged Kilmore captain Niall McCarthy to be the aggressor in a midfield confrontation and, to the astonishment of all in the ground, deemed it a red card offence.The injustice of the sending off galvanised Kilmorersquos ten men and they took the game to Lower Maze, dominating possession and creating chances.The first of these saw Caolan Conlon burst through from midfield. His shot was well saved and the rebound fell to Gary Kennedy who fired towards the net only to see Maze lsquokeeper Heron produce a great double save.Cai Gemmel, who was magnicent throughout, saw a goal bound effort deflected wide of the head of a Maze defender as it seemed destined for the top corner.As the chances came and went Kilmore got caught with a sucker punch in the nd minute.Bradford made his way down the left and his mis-cued cross beat a stranded Turley to leave Kilmore two down at half-time and up against it.Carvill changed the shape of the team at half-time and went with a front two of Paddy Grant and Josh Smyth.This change paid idends in the th minute when Grant weaved his way into the box, although it appeared he had been forced too wide, but the forward still managed to fire a rasping drive to the roof of the net.In the th minute a sustained period of Kilmore pressure brought the equaliser, with Grant again involved when his clipped cross was nodded in at the back post by the energetic Josh Smyth.Kilmore continued to dominate and press for the winner, as it seemed as though the game was destined for extra time.In the th minute the pressure finally paid off when Carvill whipped in a corner and that man Grant was on hand to hook the ball home from close range to send the Kilmore faithful into raptures.As Lower Maze then threw everything at Kilmore in injury time, the Blues defence of Magee, Larkin, Kennedy, Stewart and lsquokeeper Turley remained steadfast.Kilmorersquos substitutes of Dagen and Lynas had a chance each on the break for a fourth, but it wasnrsquot to be.Carvill spoke of his ldquoimmense pride in the resilience and determination shown by his side after the match.It came as no surprise that the Kilmore supporters man of the match went to Paddy Grant for his two goals and an assist in a match winning performance.This win sealed double delight for Kilmore, as the club recently secured approval for the installation of a new G football pitch, complete with floodlights, dug-outs, pitch side fencing and associated pathways.Kilmore: Turley, Smyth, Stewart, Larkin, Magee, Gemmell, Conlon, McCarthy, Kennedy, Carvil, Grant.

The nearby Saintfield High School, a school supported by the entire community, is in dire need of funding for expansion and refurbishment.ldquoI would call on the EA to listen to the local community and support a truly cross community educational establishment that is already in existence.Cllr Billy Walker, who represents the area, said he will not supporting the development proposal, which he described as ldquoill-thought.ldquoAs an elected representative, I will not be supporting the call for an integrated college in the Mid Down area, he told the Recorder.ldquoFirst and foremost, I want to put on record that I am not opposed to integrated education in any shape or form.Cllr Walker said along with Strangford MP Jim Shannon, they lobbied for a new integrated primary school at Drumlins in Ballynahinch and were also instrumental in helping to get the funding to turn Killyleagh Primary School into an integrated school.He continued: ldquoMy credentials speak for themselves. My concern is that we have four post-primary schools in the Rowallane area that have been very successful in the last number of years.ldquoThe four schools are totally opposed to it as this will put serious pressure on these schoolsa new integrated college opens.ldquoThese schools have an excellent track record in working together in a cross-community basis which I have seen at first hand.The councillor claimed he had seen figures to show that Blackwater College was under-subscribed by pupils and local people have made representations to him about the development proposal.He and Mr Shannon recently met with the principals of the four local schools, including The High School Ballynahinch, to hear their concerns.ldquoHow can you honestly push for another integrated school in the Mid Down area when you have another one already under-subscribed, Cllr Walker continued.ldquoIf Blackwater wants to expand, hopefully in the near future Down High will get the go-ahead for its new build which would leave a site for Blackwater to move to.

We have had lots of support from local primary schools, many of which are integrated themselves and from other integrated colleges, who you could argue we would be in more competition with.He said that the group had written to every MP and MLA in the area and pointed out that Cllr Walker had not yet been briefed by them.ldquoHe did not take up the opportunity for us to brief him which might have assuaged some of the concerns he has highlighted, said Mr Jackson.ldquoAnd while we are hoping to establish a sixth form, we are not aware that the other local schools have also applied to do something like that.He added that the group were looking at the EArsquos response to the development proposal ldquoin detail as we think that some of our assertions have not been fully understood or appreciated as the EA looks at historical data while we are looking into the future as the urban and geographical landscape changes.Mark Morgan, principal of St Colmanrsquos, described the proposal as a ldquosolo run that disregards accepted protocols and should be dismissed.He added: ldquoIt is imperative that any proposals for change in any sector of the education system must be aligned to the area planning process.Saintfield High School principal Sarah-Lucy Hynds pointed out that irrespective of the proposal, her school would continue to strive for its own expansion.She said: ldquoSaintfield High Schoolrsquos campaign to grow has remained the same for decades. The challenges we face as a result of our capped enrolment at Year  must now be addressed as a matter of urgency.Mr Seamus Hanna, principal of St Colmcillersquos, said he was disappointed with the lack of ldquoproper consultation.ldquoOn a very basic level, the proposal ignored the reality that our staff and students already come from erse faith backgrounds and our ethos is and always has been, pupil centred, welcoming and respecting every pupil, regardless of faith or academic ability, he said.ldquoOn a higher level, it ignored the reality that schools must work in partnership to place student needs above institutional interests.

While all babies are dferent, it can be helpful to think about working towards a routine by doing the same things in the same order each night so that baby learns what is coming next.Think about your little onersquos sleep environmentIt can be helpful to black out bedrooms, something that can be especially important in the summer months. Temperature is also important the Lullaby Trust, the baby sleep charity, say that the safest temperature for our little ones is - degrees celsius.Looking at how your little one falls asleep can help them get a more settled nightIt is very normal for your little one to be fed, rocked or cuddled to sleep, however this can be dficult to maintain. Practice other ways of getting your baby to sleep in their own sleep space to help find a method that suits you, your baby and your parenting style.Watch out for signs of tirednessWhile there are typical s of time that babies will happily stay awake for, the most important thing is getting to know your baby. By observing your baby, you can try to get them down for naps during the day before they get overtired. It is also important not to try to force naps when they are under tired.Fresh air and exerciseGetting out of the house for a bit will blow the cobwebs away and help your little one to burn off some energy. Inside the home your little one will also benefit from lots of time on the floor to keep them moving, while for small babies practising a bit of tummy time can be really helpful.Donrsquot always rush inhellipSometimes your little one will babble or make noise while they are asleep, and by going in too quickly we can disturb them. Equally they can sometimes wake and be happy in their sleep space. If your little one doesnrsquot need your assistance it is important to give them the space to get themselves back to sleep independently.Take care of yourself and donrsquot be afraid to ask for helpTherersquos no shame in not being able to do it all, all of the time. Being sleep deprived can be incredibly challenging and feel very lonely. Please know that is very normal for sleep to be dficult, especially in those early days. Please remember being a parent doesnrsquot always feel easy, because itrsquos not!

Photo: PacemakerUpper Bann MLA Mrs Kelly was quoted in a newspaper article as saying this week’s PSNI th anniversary was the perfect opportunity to recommit to the principle of a shared police force. The SDLP policing board member also said the creation of the PSNI was a “signicant departure from the institutionalised sectarianism represented by the RUC”.Those comments led to the NI Retired Police Officers’ Association penning an open letter to Mrs Kelly, in which the NIRPOA chairman called on the MLA to withdraw her remarks, and to apologise for the “gross offence” caused.The letter states: “I am writing to seek your immediate withdrawal of that remark, and an apology for the gross offence you have caused to the thousands of members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary GC who served this community in the most challenging of times.”Mrs Kelly responded, saying: “The SDLP has previously paid tribute to the sacrices made by many RUC officers and their families.“The fact remains that there were severe institutional problems within the RUC and this is a matter of public record. That many retired police officers continue to refuse to cooperate with legacy investigations to this day speaks for itself.”Mrs Kelly added: “The transformation of the RUC to the PSNI has been an outstanding success and whilst policing continues to be challenging I think the hard work and efforts of the those involved in implementing Patten’s recommendations deserve credit.”Ulster Unionist policing board member Mr Nesbitt said he believes his SDLP counterpart should “reflect on her comments and the hurt they have caused and apologise”.He said: “The RUC were the barrier between Northern Ireland and complete anarchy. They bravely held the line throughout the Troubles.“Dolores Kelly’s comments have caused great hurt to former officers, their families and friends. Police officers didn’t wake up hoping to hurt someone, but every terrorist did, and it was police officers who were targeted simply because they were trying to protect society and save lives”.Mr Nesbitt added: “Nobody disputes that the RUC could have done with more Catholic officers within its ranks.“I have no doubt that many more would have come forward had it not been for the fact that the IRA made a special effort to target those Catholics who did join the RUC”.Mike NesbittPSNI  \"       \"  Most PopularPortadown school contacts PSNI after TikTok accounts aimed at humiliating teachers condemnedNumber of COVID patients in Craigavon Hospital doubles in two weeksMan lost consciousness after being struck from behind in Lurgan attackCraigavon men facing charges of aggravated burglary after pensioner was confronted in his Tandragee homeTeenage boy stabbed at Halloween Fireworks Display in CraigavonMost PopularMike Nesbitt joins calls for apology over MLA’s ‘sectarian’ RUC commentsMan and woman arrested after woman seriously injured in CraigavonHalloween hooligans’ rampage in Lurgan ‘terried’ residentsPortadown murder: Shock in rural community after man arrested on suspicion of murderBuilding firms from across NI offer jobs after JMC Mechanical and Construction Ltd, goes into liquidation                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsFollow us      "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1632989885154.jpg--top_tips_for_safe_student_accommodation.jpg?163298989300","title":"top tips for safe student accommodation ","story":"With freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
