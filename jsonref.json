With the latest statics showing the university emits around 3.7kg of carbon emissions each year, it is hoped the move will drastically reduce its carbon footprint. (Stock image)\u0027Declaring a climate emergency cannot be empty words. I truly believe we face a defining moment in global history and Goldsmiths now stands shoulder to shoulder with other organisations willing to call the alarm and take urgent action to cut carbon use.\u0027As well as the beef ban and 10p levy on single-use water bottles and plastic cups, there are plans to install more solar panels across the college\u0027s New Cross campus in south-east London and switch to a 100 per cent clean energy supplier as soon as possible.          Professor Corner (pictured at The Fashion Awards in London 2018) said she believed \u0027we face a defining moment in global history\u0027 and that Goldsmiths now stood with other organisations willing to take urgent actionOfficials said Goldsmiths will also continue to invest in its allotment area and identify other places where planting could help to absorb carbon dioxide.The university will also review how all students can access modules which cover climate change and the role of both iniduals and organisations in reducing carbon emissions. Figures show that Goldsmiths emits around 3.7kg of carbon emissions each year, the college said.Referring to the statistic in a blog, Mr Leam said: \u0027It is clear our university has a huge carbon footprint. The promise to have ended this by 2030 at the latest, with the hope of doing so by 2025, is one which is needed.\u0027Whilst this planaction is only the beginning, and much work is yet to be done, it is fantastic to see Goldsmiths taking responsibility and responding to its impact on the climate.\u0027Invoking the words of teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, \u0027Our house is on fire\u0027, Mr Leam added: \u0027I believe Frances Corner and the university management are realising this and making these changes to put their part of the house fire out.\u0027The SU will be a part of this process every step of the way to make sure this stays true, seeking to speed the process up wherever possible and will keep the college community updated throughout.\u0027          Earlier today the university took to Twitter to announce its environmental mission with its followers         The university (pictured), which is situated south-east London, also plans to switch to a 100 per cent clean energy supplier as soon as possibleRosie Rogers, climate emergency campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: \u0027It\u0027s encouraging to see an institution like Goldsmiths not simply declaring a climate emergency, but acting on it.\u0027From energy use, to food sales and plastic pollution - all universities and organisations with campus sites can make changes across their facilities that are better for our planet.\u0027We call on others to urgently follow suit, and to include cutting all ties from fossil fuel funding in their climate emergency response.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Male model accuses Katy Perry pulling pants expose birthday party","story":"Share this article Kloss said that he made a minimal amount of money and any press he could have generated from appearing in the video was tightly controlled by Perry\u0027s team at the time, which later contributed to his fear of speaking out against her.\u0027I made around $650 in total off of Teenage Dream,\u0027 he said. \u0027I was lorded over by her reps, about not discussing a single thing about anything regarding Katy publicly.

Pushing past us down into the subway were kids in private-school uniforms and office types, all with their loafers and heels and buttery leather briefcases. Meanwhile, I followed the maids, the construction workers and the other nannies up to the street. The working class, I thought to myself, and the phrase buoyed me a little, waking me up after the long sleepy ride from Brooklyn. We were the invisible forces, the childcare workers and housekeepers, arriving just in time for our bosses to make their way to work. We were the foundation of that city.As a first-generation college graduate, I had never been anything but working class. Every job I’d had involved some amount of waiting on people wealthier than I was, in restaurants, offices or their homes. On the Upper East Side, I’d been hired to take care of a toddler. She was 18 months old, walking and very verbal for her age. I’d already been nannying full-time for years, in other parts of the city, and I’d sworn that this time I wouldn’t get attached.Over the next three years, my mind wandered in new ways as I cut crusts off of countless peanut butter sandwiches and repeatedly read Richard Scarry’s Cars and Trucks and Things That Go. I found myself wondering what it would be like to live the way the families I worked for did – to have a washing machine, designer heels, a doorman, a bank account containing more than $50. Sometimes I played a little game in my head as I pushed my toddler charge around the city in my frayed winter coat and cheap boots: I imagined myself as her mother.Though these fantasies filled me with guilt, I couldn’t escape them. I was reminded of Marcy Dermansky’s Bad Marie, where the eponymous nanny effectively kidnaps the two-year-old daughter of her employer, but proceeds to take quite good care of her.I gobbled up books about nannies on my commute: from Lorrie Moore’s witty and touching A Gate at the Stairs to Leïla Slimani’s dark and propulsive Lullaby. I found myself drawn into things I would normally disregard. I binge-watched all six seasons of Gossip Girl. I read Primates of Park Avenue, and yes, even The Nanny Diaries. I was addicted to the outsider’s perspective.The year before I began working for this family, I had graduated from Columbia University with a master’s in creative writing. Those two short years had been some of the best of my life, but left me $100,000 in debt. So I started nannying, because it paid marginally better than most of the copywriting jobs I was now qualified for, and I thought it would be less taxing, leaving me free to focus on my writing at night. In actuality, I was exhausted after long, often 10-hour days with children, and I still struggled to put aside enough money for my repayment plan. My student loans were growing every month and writing was slow and painful. I worried that it had all been a horrible mistake: school, my confidence in my artistic abilities, my hopes for a life that was entirely unlike the one I’d been born into.“Life isn’t about money,” my dad told me. “Or your career. You’ll realise that when you have kids.”It was a strange thing for him to say. My dad worked six days a week for my whole childhood, rarely taking vacations. I didn’t know how to respond. Having kids seemed like a privilege reserved only for the very wealthy.“Nannying is good practice for when you have your own,” my employers said, but I was convinced that it was as close as I would ever get to motherhood. I was mourning what I assumed could never be mine from a very close distance, trying to understand it as if I were actually inside.The little girl I watched on the Upper East Side used to call me her Madeline. “I have a mommy, a daddy, and a Madeline,” she’d say whenever anyone asked about her family. Once, picking her up from preschool, she waved a pink-and-purple splotched paper at me, exclaiming, “It’s you! It’s a picture of you and you’re walking to pick me up and you have your nails painted and you’re the cutest Madeline in the whole wide world!”One day, the little girl’s mother had a morning off. She followed her daughter and me to a baby singalong that we had attended regularly, but never with her. As usual, I joined the other children on the rug in the centre of restaurant, holding the toddler’s hand as she danced to the guitar music while the mother stood back, unsure what to do. I glanced up and saw her stealthily wiping away tears. While I often felt out of place in the adult world, she must have felt the same way in this silly kid world where everyone sang and danced and drew.The last family I worked for had one son, older than the babies and preschoolers I was used to. For his ninth birthday his mother bought him a new bike. She’d arranged to meet us at the bike shop after work, but as usual she was held up. We sat waiting until the employees felt sorry for this little boy, who couldn’t stay still for excitement. “He can take it,” they said. “He can ride it around.”I watched as he pedalled down the street, looking gangly and uncertain on the bike, like a new baby deer. I watched him nervously brake for pedestrians, the wheels shaking a little, and my heart pounded when he approached the intersection, even though it wasn’t busy.By the time his mom arrived, over an hour late, he was an old hand on the thing. He was bored and ready to leave as she examined all the different features, he just said: “Yep.” She’d bought the bike, but missed the experience.Stephanie Land’s memoir Maid explains the strange intimacy of working in someone else’s home. “I became a witness … I almost felt like I had the opportunity to get to know my clients better than any of their relatives did,” she writes. “I’d learn what they ate for breakfast, what shows they watched, if they’d been sick and for how long. I’d see them, even if they weren’t home, by the imprints lefts in their beds and tissues on the nightstand.”I certainly knew the children I worked with better than their relatives. Sometimes, I felt I knew them better than their parents.The families I worked for were privileged. They had private-school educations, college tuitions paid outright, big apartments in safe neighbourhoods. I often resented them as I struggled to afford groceries and hoped that small holes and stains on my clothes would go unnoticed. It was no surprise that when I began to write, in bursts on weekends and during nap times, I wrote about envy and resentment. Though the characters in my novel are not based on any of my employers, they are based on the attitudes I saw, and the peculiar intimacy I experienced. Because I didn’t know what to do with my resentment, I allowed my protagonist to let hers take the lead. I think this is why we are all so fascinated by the lives of the rich: we love to nurture our resentment, lust and jealousy, to hold it close and live inside it.I spent seven years taking care of other people’s children. I still don’t know whether or not I’m destined for motherhood, but I miss the kids I worked with fiercely, though they no longer exist as I remember them. I saw the little girl from the Upper East Side twice after that job ended. The first time I met her and her mother at the politan Museum she rubbed my arm against her cheek with her usual ridiculous affection, and I went home and cried. (Clearly I had become attached.) The second time, in a restaurant two years ago, she was bigger, missing teeth, more reserved. She told me she could ride a two-wheeler all by herself and whined to her dad that she was ready to leave. Now, she probably barely remembers me.Children overturn our whole lives. We mourn them constantly as they grow, but for them, their early years stay fragmented and blurry. These parents’ memories of this period were also fragmented, lost forever when the nanny left. I’m not sure what do with all these memories of children that don’t belong to me. Though they don’t fit in my own life, I feel lucky to carry them around. This was my privilege. The parents got to have their children, but they also had to give them up.• Devotion by Madeline Stevens is published by Faber \u0026amp Faber on 15 August (£12.99)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70bdc27beef3593f14325b072c48d4a3e2167744/0_525_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=310db84b9c7ccb99144520896a4369fb","title":"three blackout near misses in three months says national grid","story":"Exclusive: Industry sources say system operator aware of growing potential of blackouts ‘for years’National Grid had experienced three blackout “near-misses” in as many months before Friday’s major outage left almost a million homes in the dark and forced trains to a standstill around the UK.The system operator, already under investigation by the energy watchdog, faces criticism from within the industry that it has not done enough to guard against the risk of blackouts.National Grid blamed the “incredibly rare” nationwide power cut on a severe slump in the grid’s frequency – a measure of energy intensity – following the unexpected shutdown of two power generators.It will face an investigation into its handling of the energy system after the first blackout in more than a decade following the shutdown of a gas-fired power plant in Bedfordshire and the Hornsea windfarm in the North Sea at about 5pm of Friday.It said it would work with the regulator and energy companies to “understand the lessons learned” after two power plants shut down unexpectedly within minutes of each other, causing severe rush hour travel disruption across the country.But industry sources claim National Grid has been aware of the growing potential for a wide-scale blackout “for years”, and has suffered a spate of near-misses in recent weeks. understands that in every month since May there has been a severe dip in the grid’s frequency from its normal range around 50Hz. Industry sources have confirmed that the grid’s frequency has fallen below 49.6Hz on three different occasions in recent months, the deepest falls seen on the UK grid since 2015. On Friday the blackout was triggered when the frequency slumped to 48.88Hz.In June, the frequency of the grid plummeted to within a whisker of National Grid’s legal limit of 49.5Hz after all three units of EDF Energy’s West Burton gas-fired power plant in Nottinghamshire tripped offline without warning.The unexpected outage triggered an emergency call for backup electricity supplies which stabilised the energy grid’s frequency before a blackout was triggered.In addition, the grid’s frequency fell to 49.55Hz on 9 May, and 49.58Hz of 11 July.A spokesman for National Grid said these events were “independent”. He added that there was “no trend or prediction of more frequency excursions”.“Over the past four years frequency has regularly fluctuated between the agreed limits, as part of the normal day-to-day operation of the electricity system,” he added.Steve Shine, chairman of Anesco, a battery company, said: “It would be easy for National Grid to write this incident off as a fluke event, but they have actually been aware of this potential issue for many years.”The growing concern over National Grid’s grip on the energy system has emerged as the energy regulator, Ofgem, issued an ultimatum to the system operator calling for an interim report on the blackouts by the end of the week ahead of a full technical report by early September.National Grid has managed to avoid wide scale blackouts by triggering last-minute contracts to help it stabilise the grid and avoid breaching the crucial 49.5Hz limit set by the regulator.It contracts energy suppliers to ramp up their output from generators and batteries to make up for an outage, and offers contracts to companies such as factories and supermarkets, which can temporarily cut their energy demand to help stabilise the frequency of the grid.But many of the companies tasked with supplying the “safety net services” – such as batteries and diesel farms, which are banks of small-scale generators – have warned that National Grid is not doing enough to safeguard the system against blackouts.The UK’s booming renewable energy output can make it more difficult for National Grid to balance the frequency of the grid, which was originally built to accommodate fossil fuel power plants, which generate more intensive energy.National Grid said it had embraced the UK’s renewable industry by developing “frequency response” tools – such as quick-fire back-up supplies of extra electricity – which should make it technically possible to run the energy system without any fossil fuels by 2025.Shine said: “What is needed is a greater volume of faster response services, which can be called into action when the frequency drops. This would have prevented the need to turn the power off.“It’s worrying that with just two generation sources dropping out of the supply mix, National Grid was still unable to deliver power to all areas, with no proper contingency plan in place,” he said.“It’s exactly this kind of scenario the UK needs to be prepared for – these recent events demonstrate how important it is to have more, faster response services available, which can be called into action when the frequency drops,” he said.Steven Meerman, the founder of battery firm Zenobe, called on National Grid to “update its old rules of thumb” to determine how many reserve services it kept on standby in the future.“It may be the energy system is changing faster than expected,” he said.John Pettigrew, National Grid’s chief executive, defended the grid’s response in a post on social media site LinkedIn entitled “there is never a good time for a power cut”.He said: “Contrary to some erroneous media reports, I am not on holiday – indeed, I’ve been at my desk all weekend.“As CEO of National Grid plc ultimately the buck stops with me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5b4887466fc420c2cf80539c9fdb3f05445a472/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3363d72f5182a628361eeda717ec63f0","title":"brexit and boeing dent tui profits","story":"The firm’s earnings fell to €100.9m from €186.8m in the three months to 30 June, its third quarter.

Downing Street gave every department 72 hours last week to present watertight crash-out plans and woe betide any whose ideas blow up later, Dominic Cummings menaced. “Task and finish units” will stress-test each one: tremble at the military-style management speak.Searching for what forms to fill, HMRC’s list of codes has been impossible for his complex products, where the quantity and original source of each ingredient needs a separate coding. “The paperwork is crazy,” he says. Each form has three pages, one needed for each of his 50 products with certificates of origin relating to ingredients from all over the world. “That’s what the single market did away with in 1994,” he says.Baker’s post-Brexit transaction costs include paying a carrier £100 a time to fill out the right forms, and a customs clearance agent to check and process duty paper work: qualified agents are in short supply. The company and each of his staff need security vetting to get exports through ports with less checking, requiring him to hire a security vetting consultant too. “I spoke to Revenue \u0026amp Customs for details but they said, ‘Look, we have had no indication what will be in place on 1 November.’” Baker is an experienced exporter, with an MBA from the London Business School, but the lack of information and the utter unpreparedness of government defeats him.Here’s what makes Calico Cottage’s story particularly alarming. Baker’s MP is Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, with an office just down the road. Baker asked Barclay to come round and examine the forms, to view the impossible task with insufficient information from HMRC for products like his. In mid-June Barclay sent round an assistant who spent more than two hours trying to puzzle out just one set of forms. The assistant couldn’t fathom the absent information but promised that Barclay would write a letter to HMRC for the missing details.For an insight into the current chaos, what came back two weeks later from HMRC to the secretary of state was a pro-forma letter as if written to any member of the public: “Dear Mr Barclay, Please accept our apologies for the delay in acknowledging your case. We aim to send you a substantive response as soon as possible. Yours sincerely …” HMRC is supposed to reply within a month, but the time is now very short – and how many thousands of other exporters are caught in this backlog?Baker wrote a shirty letter to Barclay, “as a loyal Tory voter all my life”. He invited him to “try filling out the following form which is the government’s ‘easy path to exporting to Norway’. It’s time consuming, HMRC is unhelpful and it costs a fortune to get the paperwork done. If this is your best model for Brexit try it yourself and then maybe even you and your Brexiters will think again.” Calico Cottage already exports to Norway: if that’s the government’s best model for a future EU free-trade agreement, it’s no substitute for the single market. “You have to fill out a paper form in triplicate with carbon copies, nothing online.”Brexit is already affecting Baker’s business as, short of warehousing, he tries to get all the Christmas orders out of the country and raw materials in before 31 October. Worse, prices are so unpredictable that suppliers such Tate \u0026amp Lyle refuse to sign a fixed contract for sugar, so are free to cancel at any time.Baker writes to his MP, “Voters like me find ourselves with no political home.” The frustration felt by so many in business erupts as his letter to me continues: “What amazes me is that the Brexit secretary and his team did not have an answer immediately … Given they’ve had three years, you can imagine that business owners such as myself are simply stunned at the incompetence of the politicians.”The great “ready-for-Brexit” sham paraded in Downing Street with all this “task and finish” talk may be designed to convince EU negotiators that Boris Johnson is deadly serious about no deal. But Brussels knows it’s all bravado.They too can hear the likes of Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, saying Calico Cottage’s experience is widespread. “The industry can never be ready,” says Wright. “With so many possible eventualities, it’s pinning jelly to the wall. There will be random shortages and unpredictable chaos. No commodity prices can be fixed. No one knows what haulage will cost, if queues or fear of visas make EU drivers refuse to come here. Some things will be fine, but some will be much worse than we think – the unknown unknowns.” When it turns out that the Brexit secretary and his assistants are as clueless as anyone else, all this macho “preparedness” looks absurdly shallow.How ready are the regions? Just one example: I was talking to Bristol’s dynamic elected mayor, Marvin Rees, about council budgets and cuts, when he spread his hands out in a kind of despair at the governmental neglect. “All I’ve been given is a grand total of £210,000 by Westminster for our Brexit preparations. How far do they think that will go when they say it should cover policing food riots, and compensating problems Brexit causes for business, transport or anything else?”The Times yesterday revealed that Cabinet Office plans include invoking the Civil Contingencies Act, with its almost unlimited emergency powers if Brexit threatens “serious damage”. Meanwhile, the Treasury seems to have spare time from its preparations to include Sajid Javid’s bizarre intention to mint new 50p coins. They will be embossed with the words “friendship with all nations”, a Ministry of Truth upside-down inversion to commemorate a no-deal Brexit with a no-£39bn crash-out that breaks friendship with our neighbours for years to come.

Alas, a week is such a long time in politics that Caroline Lucas has managed to jump on the bandwagon herself. As a Green party member I find the whole thing intensely embarrassing. Yes, the party has its share of weirdos and cranks, just like every other party, but they have been on the right side of the most important political ides in our country for longer than Labour, and that’s no small thing.Before 2015, the Greens were your only realistic choice if you wanted a wholeheartedly anti-austerity, anti-workfare party. Now that the Arctic is regularly catching fire it makes even more sense to support a party with environmental policy at its core. Unfortunately Brexit seems to have proven just as brain-meltingly toxic for the Greens as it has for every other party. Lucas, usually a canny parliamentary operator who can punch well above her weight, has inexplicably tied the party to an unworkable fantasy that only exists because hard remainers dislike Jeremy Corbyn more than they fear a no-deal Brexit. And that’s without even getting into the fact that her fantasy 10-woman cabinet did not include a single woman of colour.It makes sense that centrists, having seen their ideology’s reputation tank with the public, have now decided that democracy is a luxury we can no longer afford. It’s a mistake, though, to see Brexit as being caused by too much democracy. Instead it should be seen as the result of the UK’s democratic deficit. This cannot be fixed by telling people to sit down and be quiet: proper accountability, not technocratic backroom deals, is what’s needed if parliament is to regain its legitimacy after this mess.Ironically the argument “we just want to stop no deal” comes after the hard-remain faction’s longstanding accusal of Corbyn as being a crypto-leaver because Labour’s policies reflected a compromise between the party’s soft-leave and remain wings: exactly the alliance this temporary government is supposed to be unifying against the hardline no-dealers. It’s impossible to say what might have happened if this broad anti-no deal arrangement had been sought in 2016, or if certain factions hadn’t been so keen to use remain as an anti-Corbyn Trojan horse. Even now, despite the fact that they’re trying to implement what basically amounts to Labour party policy, they are still throwing a tantrum over involving the Labour leader.Corbyn’s personal beliefs on Brexit are presented as the obstacle to working with him, but this contradicts the omnipresence of Yvette Cooper in every Stop Brexit fantasy proposal. Cooper’s position on Brexit is barely distinguishable from Corbyn’s: if anything, she is more hardline on some issues, like freedom of movement. It is difficult not to conclude that, even at the 11th hour, the problem is not Corbyn’s beliefs but a resistance to him as prime minister, whatever the circumstances.That’s why it makes no sense for Lucas to get involved in these shenanigans. There is much more alignment between Green party policy and the direction of Labour under Corbyn than there would be if the centrists succeeded in wresting back control of the party. The Greens don’t need to wholeheartedly back Corbyn, and should still campaign against Labour where the parties are in disagreement. But they should recognise that as a minor party it does them much more good to work with those who agree broadly with their overall policy platform than to seek out narrow alliances with people who will jettison them as soon as they are no longer useful.Lucas wrote: “Political tribalism would likely scupper any moves that are just about putting Jeremy Corbyn in charge” – but despite his unpopularity among “the sensibles”, Corbyn remains the leader of the opposition and commands sufficient support within his party to ensure any challenger is seen off. No national unity gubbins can get past the fact that all roads to stopping Brexit run through a Labour government. Whether you believe Corbyn is pro-Brexit or not, he is against no deal, unlike Johnson’s cabinet. Remainers seem to understand that it would be awful if the decision put before parliament – or put to the public in a second referendum – was “Johnson’s deal v no deal”, but would seemingly rather try anything before making the choice of “Corbyn’s deal v remain”.If it is so important that no deal is prevented at all costs, if this is not just all political posturing, then the “no Corbyns” sign has to come down off the treehouse.• Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3db3aeb94c2b1863995f6ffcd68ee4ad56a8a139/0_18_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b97072bd08e85195c03870d769689d1","title":"us no deal john bolton trade foreign policy","story":"If you thought it was bad enough when Donald Trump held a reluctant Theresa May’s hand, then look away now. For things are about to get sweatier.The president’s clammy embrace of the British right continued this week with the arrival of his national security adviser John Bolton in London, to declare the most isolationist US regime in living memory would “enthusiastically” support a no-deal Brexit.A weakened country, desperate for a trade deal and in no position to refuse Donald Trump’s demands not just to lower our stringent standards or hamstring our car industry but on foreign policy too? Step right this way, sir! No wonder Bolton talks of us being at the front of the queue for trade talks, a line every bit as clearly crafted to help Downing Street as President Obama’s suggestion during the 2016 referendum that Brexit would push us to the back of it. And if these presidents can’t both be right, then arguably neither can the two very different British Conservative administrations responsible for ghostwriting their respective lines.To some leave voters, all this will sound like sour grapes from people who can’t bear to admit that there might be life after Brexit. Many will actively share the Trump administration’s rejection of open borders and its distaste for rules-based international organisations, from the United Nations to Nato to the World Trade Organisation, which require sovereign nations sometimes to compromise or subjugate their own interests to the greater global good.But as the former foreign secretary Jack Straw pointed out on Radio 4’s Today programme this morning, those organisations exist to check the potentially overwhelming clout of the biggest superpowers, in the interests of medium-sized and small countries who would otherwise be vulnerable. Brexit is rooted in a refusal to accept that Britain is now in the latter category not the former, and that we consequently risk exchanging what leavers are fond of calling diktats from Brussels for diktats from Washington or Beijing. Only this time we may not get a veto.All trade negotiations naturally involve both sides trying to re-engineer things to their own advantage, of course. But the risks are heightened for small countries negotiating with bigger and more powerful ones – one reason EU countries banded together to do trade deals in the first place – and this time big foreign policy as well as economic principles are at stake.After his meeting with Boris Johnson, Bolton insisted that touchy issues like the Iran nuclear deal (which the US would like us to follow them in walking away from) or contracts with the Chinese tech firm Huawei (essentially ditto) could be left until “after Brexit”. But it’s naive in the extreme to imagine that they will be left until after trade negotiations have taken place – a process that is likely to take years. There is likely to be early pressure too to ditch practices that inconvenience American companies, such as Philip Hammond’s planned digital-services tax targeting tech giants who pay scandalously little in Britain. And Britain after a no-deal Brexit would be a beggar, not a chooser a panicky minnow “negotiating” with a shark whose sole stated purpose is making sharks great again.The real surprise isn’t that the White House actively favours a chaotic orce between Britain and its European allies, irritatingly sceptical as the latter can be about US power that serves us up on a plate to Washington. It’s that the British government seems so trustingly inclined to go along with it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e054feb59b0bae24bbdf8db75426d64e342cdd9b/0_167_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=293a800463ecda523668f72430c985f7","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of lazy","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘lazy’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘lazy’.Share your photos of what lazy means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 14 August at 10am.

Universities are expecting this route, which opens on A-level results day next Thursday, to be even more popular this year.“Students are applying later and later every year,” says Helen Bower, assistant marketing director at Northumbria University. “They feel they have more choice so they don’t have to pick a university in the main cycle, they can wait to see what’s in clearing.”There are currently 30,000 courses with vacancies at a wide range of universities. This year, Cambridge is entering clearing for the first time, with places reserved for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.The admissions system is currently under review by the universities watchdog, the Office for Students, and by Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors. This follows unease over the process of using predicted grades, which are unreliable, and concerns about the pressure on students of having to reach target grades.The University and College Union, the lecturers’ trade union, has called for UK universities to adopt a post-qualifications admissions system, in line with most other countries. Under this system students would all apply to university after obtaining their grades, which would remove the incentive for universities to issue unconditional offers to persuade students to choose their institution.Matthew Cartwright, 20, is now in his second year of a degree course in computer science with AI at Northumbria University after opting to apply through clearing. He delayed his application because he could not decide what to study. “I didn’t want to take a course and think ‘oh no, this isn’t for me’, and having gone down the process to feel I’d have to stick to it,” he says.Cartwright liked the fact his options had been narrowed to four in clearing. “It was easier to make the decision. When we were doing the normal process there were so many options,” he says. “I got on a bus having never interacted with Northumbria uni before and got off the bus and they’d offered me the place. It was really simple.”While clearing was once a second chance for students who had missed their grades, many now use it to apply for the first time or because they’ve changed their mind, or they want to try their luck at a more prestigious university.To reflect the changing system, for the first time this year Ucas is allowing students to release themselves from their first-choice university, which allows them to shop around for a new institution.Alyssa Phillips, director of student recruitment at Staffordshire University, says: “The Ucas process is becoming much more flexible. It could mean more students changing their mind over the summer about their first choice university.”Some universities are seeing more late applications than others. Tony Flaherty, acting head of admissions at the University of Sheffield, a member of the Russell Group, says most applications arrive by the January deadline, with few first-time applications during clearing. “But we do see applicants submitting right up to the main cycle deadline in June,” he says.Robert McGowan, director of admissions and recruitment at Coventry University, says this reflects the changing profile of students looking to enter university. “What they’re asking for and demanding around flexibility and multiple intakes is very different from that traditional model, which is an undergraduate degree starting in September,” he says.“Universities really need to respond to a changing student, and exactly what the requirements and needs are of different groups. I think that will be one of the most significant things that changes over the next few years.”Coventry offers multiple start times across the year through its CU Coventry spin-off, and Davies says he has seen growing demand for these. He has also seen a growth in the number of students applying to the university direct, rather than through Ucas.“I don’t think the system is particularly good for students. We force specialism in our education system much earlier than in other countries and we also ask them to make a choice of uni 18 months before – that’s a long time for a 16- to 17-year-old in terms of their taste.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6492c872d5e54987263d23483f64f2637d7cc47b/0_213_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6848ed21f1f4908ea3cb24af88ff064e","title":"eton master wants pupils learn slow education mike grenier","story":"‘Slow education’ should replace the fact-crammed curriculum, argues Mike Grenier. But would this work in the state sector?You may not have heard of slow education but you probably know about the slow food movement, founded in Italy in 1986 and hugely popular worldwide. Slow food is the opposite of fast food: it promotes local ingredients and traditional cooking in place of processed ready meals and takeaways. After its success, along came slow fashion (buy clothes that last), slow TV (spend hours watching a boat drift down a river) and so on.To learn about slow education, I go to see Mike Grenier, a 49-year-old English teacher at Eton who founded a UK movement to promote it in 2012. “Slow education”, Grenier explains in his disappointingly modern and nondescript Eton classroom, “means developing lasting relationships between student and teacher and between student and learning”. It means more time for discussion, reflection and learning in depth, he says.“At the moment, we’re giving them packaged subject syllabuses and feeding them bite-sized dollops. It’s like a GP handing out pills. When you’ve taken them all and completed the course, you’ll be ‘better at’ whatever subject it is. Children from age four to at least 18 are required to prove themselves on a series of tests. It is a very impoverished view of what human beings are.”Slow education means cutting down on curriculum content. “The total sum of knowledge we now have on most subjects is enormous. Think of biology and the developments in genetics and neuroscience over the past 25 years, or physics and the increased understanding of quantum theory and how the universe works.“It’s all being crammed into syllabuses and it’s reached saturation point. Teachers say to students that ‘we have got to get through it’. The generation we are teaching now will live to at least 85 or 90. Why are we in such a hurry?”The idea of slow education was developed in the US early this century by Maurice Holt, who headed a pioneering comprehensive in Hertfordshire in the 1960s and later moved to the University of Colorado. He and Joe Harrison-Greaves, a musician and creative education consultant in the north-west, were among those who helped Grenier found the UK’s slow education movement.Holt argued that, just as it was “better to eat one portion of grilled halibut than three king-sized burgers”, so it was “better to examine in detail why Sir Thomas More chose martyrdom than to memorise the kings of England”. He was reacting to the worldwide growth in what he called “standards-driven education” and “test-shaped knowledge” – all of which has increased in recent years, thanks largely to Michael Gove’s curriculum and examination reforms.Does slow education mean returning to “learning by discovery”, “child-centred education” and other 1960s ideas? “No,” Grenier replies with a slight shudder. “Some of the fundamental tenets of slow education are conservative.”He argues that slow teaching should be underpinned by a version of the classical “trivium” described by Plato, comprising the basics of language, thought and analysis, and communication.“It’s not throwing everything up in the air and having a Woodstock-style let-it-all-hang-out. There are times when the most effective way to convey concepts and ideas is to use direct instruction and put things up on a whiteboard. Give students five, six, seven key concepts that they really need to know and then, because they can keep returning to these, it is easier for them to explore.”The stereotype of child-centred learning, he says, is that “you say to students: here’s Romeo and Juliet, tell me what you think of it”. It’s better, he says, first to introduce basic concepts of Shakespearian drama such as tragedy.So where does he stand on the “knowledge-rich” curriculum currently in vogue? “Knowledge-rich is clearly better than knowledge-poor but it is how the knowledge is used that is critical.” He wants his pupils to learn what a sonnet is, but also to explore how the form can be used effectively.How much slow education goes on at Eton? “We nail down the things we have to do, while also taking every opportunity to do things in new ways. Because we are a boarding school, students have a huge amount of additional time to do independent reading and show self-motivated love of a subject or skill.”Grenier, whose father was an investment manager and his mother a teacher, was a pupil at Eton before he went to Oxford. After leaving university he intended to take a course in teaching English as a foreign language but, “covering bases”, wrote to about 25 schools in England to tell them he was “keen on teaching”. Eton offered him a term as sabbatical cover – and there he still is 25 years later. To most of us, it may seem extraordinary – but not perhaps at Eton where, until the 1940s, pupils were taught almost exclusively by old Etonians.So is Grenier (whose son is also an Eton pupil) living in a bubble? Is slow education just a luxury, affordable only at schools where pupils have so much economic, social and cultural capital that they will succeed however you teach them?He says he is closely involved in Eton’s outreach programme and works in a variety of state schools in the Thames Valley.With Harrison-Greaves, he helped set up a network of schools that have explored introducing slow education in largely working-class Lancashire towns, such as Blackburn and Rochdale. He says that School 21, a free school opened in a deprived area of east London by Peter Hyman, a former Tony Blair aide, also embodies slow education ideas.But can he convince the mass of middle-class and aspirational working-class parents, desperate for their children to acquire certificates that will propel them into professional careers, of the merits of slow education?“More often than not,” Grenier replies, “parents want their children to be happy at school as well as to achieve. But we have a system that separates those things. It measures how well schools are doing in terms of numbers but it doesn’t take account of personal and social development.”Shouldn’t he set up a slow free school? “That’s not a plan at the moment. They’re not really free. To set one up, you’d have to tick so many boxes that you wouldn’t want to tick.”So how can slow education move forward? “We need a royal commission into our education system,” he says. I point out that royal commissions are out of fashion – none has been set up this century – mainly because they take so much time. “It should be a slow process. There’s lots that needs to be thought about: what we now know about child development and how the brain learns, children’s mental health, the effects of social media and so on.”I admire Grenier’s refusal to be rushed. The economist Milton Friedman started preaching the virtues of free markets in the 1950s governments finally embraced his ideas in the 1980s. I have a hunch Grenier’s time will eventually come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f146224032e7899114581708987794c5e513fba8/85_12_866_520/master/866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9da161e7d82ad6a81c5314925a4af4e","title":"one giant leap for indian cinema how bollywood embraced sci fi","story":"As the country seeks to establish itself as a space power, audiences are developing an appetite for the extraterrestrial on the big screenIn 2014, India sent the Mars Orbiter Mission into space, and became the first country to send a satellite to orbit the planet at its first attempt – putting its much richer regional rival China in the shade as it became the first Asian nation to get to the red planet. The project was notable for being led by a team of female scientists as is India’s second lunar probe, Chandrayaan-2 (from the Sanskrit for “moon craft”), which was launched last month and is due to land on the moon in early September. And as the country establishes itself as a space power, Indians have developed an appetite for sci-fi themes in its cinema.The patriotic outburst that followed the Mars mission has fuelled the latest example of Indian space cinema: Mission Mangal (Sanskrit for Mars), a fictionalised account of the Orbiter Mission. Starring and produced by Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar, it is due for release on 15 August, India’s Independence Day. “I would follow the news about India’s space missions and feel proud of what we were achieving,” says Kumar. “But through Mission Mangal I guess you could say I have an insider’s perspective.”Kumar, one of the highest paid actors in the world, says he had long wanted to work with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Starring in a film about Mangalyaan (“Mars craft”) required him to take a crash course in astrophysics. “I now understand the amount of effort and planning it takes to successfully execute a space mission and my respect for all the scientists and engineers who work on these missions has grown immensely,” says Kumar.Sci-fi isn’t a new genre in Indian cinema, but it has nothing like the profile it has in the west. It only established itself after the country’s economy liberalised in the 1990s, allowing the entry of satellite channels and foreign movies, as well as studios such as Disney and Warner into Bollywood production. Before then, what little there was consisted mostly of low-budget fare involving superheroes. The biggest success was 2003’s Koi … Mil Gaya (Found Someone), an ET: The Extra-Terrestrial rip-off in which Hrithik Roshan is healed of his intellectual disability – in his 20s, he still hasn’t graduated from a primary school – by the magical touch of a blue alien he befriends, who transforms him into a muscular high-school sports star, girl-magnet and maths genius. With possibly the crassest portrayal of an adult with a learning disability one could ever see, Koi … Mil Gaya was Roshan’s breakthrough performance, making him a star and winning him a national Filmfare award.Fortunately, sci-fi has moved on a great deal since, given India’s greater exposure to foreign films. “Indian audiences have responded enthusiastically to space and sci-fi films such as the Star Wars series or the s of the Galaxy franchise,” Kumar says. “Unfortunately, it’s a genre that hasn’t been explored in Bollywood.”One reason might be the box office failure of Love Story 2050 in 2008. A frenzied time travel movie, it broke India’s film-budget record, but its mix of Mad Max futurism, slushy romance and traditional Bollywood song-and-dance routines was a flop.While Hollywood has a long tradition of making more naturalistic films about space travel – from 2001: A Space Odyssey, to Gravity and First Man – it’s only now, with the enormous strides in India’s own space exploration, that such films are beginning to resonate with the public. “It’s about time” says Kumar, “because this is one genre of film that appeals to people across all age groups. It encourages people to expand their vision and their thoughts, and truly believe that even the impossible can become possible. It is surprising that mainstream film-makers in India haven’t embraced the genre as much as we should. There is definitely so much potential.”Then again, last year Kumar played the villain in 2.0, a Tamil-language thriller about Chennai’s mobile phones going berserk and arranging themselves into creatures that devastate the city – a bit like a Vodafone version of The Birds. Reportedly with a budget of $76m – costing more than ISRO’s entire mission to Mars – it was a visual rollercoaster and a big commercial success.Another key factor over the last decade has been the boom in India’s visual effects industry – to which Hollywood outsources much of its own special effects – that has enabled higher quality film-making. While Koi … Mil Gaya looked like a trashy 80s TV show, it spawned a superhero franchise, Krrish, starring Roshan. The fourth instalment is released next year, and each film has exhibited a giant step forward in Bollywood’s use of CGI (as well as Roshan’s acting ability).With these high profile missions to the moon and Mars, sci-fi is set to become a Bollywood staple. “The Indian audience, especially the youth segment, now constantly seeks newer themes and stories,” says Vikram Malhotra, CEO of Abundantia Entertainment, one of India’s biggest production companies. “There has been so much talk and discussion about India’s space programmes and the achievements of our scientists that even the common man now wants to know more about this fascinating world. And on the big screen.”• Mission Mangal is released on 15 August in India and the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/627f274db9072617ae0e57807c68383ce2d6cb10/310_734_6551_3930/master/6551.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec09c67665fc924fabc1b2715aa9db2a","title":"nigel slater courgette rosti burrata and tomatoes","story":"Crisp little fritters made with one of summer’s most prolific vegetables, topped with sweet tomatoes and mild milky cheeseRoughly grate 200g potatoes into a large bowl without peeling them.

De Boer is a realist. Zero points and zero goals from four league games before his September 2017 sacking at Crystal Palace was indeed historically poor.“At that moment, he can say that because it was a really bad record, of course,” De Boer tells the . “For me, if he wants to say that, I’m not the guy who wants to respond to that … I think karma always strikes back.”De Boer lasted just 77 days at Selhurst Park, a short tenure that came on the heels of an 85-day run at Internazionale. After a world-class playing career and establishing himself as one of Europe’s rising managerial stars with four Ereisie titles in six years at his boyhood club, Ajax, De Boer’s reputation crumbled to dust in 13 months.Now the 49-year-old manages Atlanta United, the reigning Major League Soccer champions who in their first two seasons shattered all expectations of what club football can look like in America, on the field and in the stands. De Boer replaced former Barcelona and Argentina boss Gerardo “Tata” Martino in January. De Boer’s start in Atlanta was familiar: his team did not pick up a win from their first four MLS games. After Atlanta publicly set the goal of becoming the first American side to become Concacaf club champions since LA Galaxy in 2000, they crashed out in the quarter-finals. Atlanta scored 149 goals in MLS play over their first two seasons. They managed two in the first month of 2019. A Mercedes-Benz Stadium crowd of 70,382 booed De Boer’s team off the field following a 1-1 draw against MLS expansion side FC Cincinnati in Atlanta’s home opener.Results have since improved. De Boer says he never lost confidence during yet another dismal start. Now, into the second-half of the season, Atlanta are up to second place in MLS’s Eastern Conference and have reached the final of the US Open Cup.De Boer is certain this recovery proves he would have achieved the same resurgence at Inter and Palace. “I’m convinced,” he says over a double espresso in the lobby of Atlanta’s palatial training center. “I think if we get the time we should, we definitely turn it around, especially at Crystal Palace. We had a feeling, in training you saw it, that this is the moment we’re going to go looking up and win games. And then they decided to sack me. Of course that’s not the nicest feeling, but it’s like that.”De Boer claims to still have a good relationship with Crystal Palace fans: “I think they know I put all my effort in it, and in England they just want to see that, that’s for sure.” But he feels shortchanged by his brief time at the club and believes he did not receive a fair chance at achieving the task with which he was charged.“I was especially angry,” de Boer says. “They do some promises and they have a philosophy: ‘OK, we want to be a solid club.’ For example, Crystal Palace, you have to also play like a modern team and don’t play relegation football. If you want to do that, OK, one year you can survive, maybe two years. But one time you will go down, I am convinced.“So they wanted to change that, like Southampton was doing in that period. I saw that picture in front of me, so I had the feeling that I had time, but when the season started, you already see some signs that this is not the way. You always walk in front of a door, and it’s not opening, and I had the feeling again, and also at Inter, that we have to do this and this, and then we make our steps forward. Every time somebody was stepping on the brakes.”A ball-playing center-back with 112 caps for the Netherlands, De Boer estimates he would be worth 70m-80m euros if he was playing today. He says Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk is the best central defender in the world right now, though he acknowledges that assertion may be “patriotic.”De Boer won six league titles and one Champions League in his 16 seasons playing with Ajax and Barcelona. Three months ago, his old clubs were close to meeting in a “De Boer derby” of sorts at the Champions League final in Madrid. However, both experienced excruciating semi-final exits at the hands of English sides – depleted English sides at that.De Boer also talks about a more sinister aspect of European football. He recalls a game he played with Ajax at Hungary’s Ferencváros. Fans directed ape noises at his black teammates, Patrick Kluivert and Edgar Davids. Decades later, racial abuse inside football grounds is still a problem across Europe. De Boer believes “really big fines” should be levied against teams whose supporters engage in racism and, if that doesn’t work, closed stadiums and docked points should be looked at. “In Holland, we have a saying: ‘If you don’t learn it the soft way, you have to learn it the hard way.’”De Boer captained the Netherlands to a fourth-place finish at the 1998 World Cup in France. This year, the Dutch women reach the Women’s World Cup final, where they lost to the US. The Royal Dutch Football Association, meanwhile, has taken the lead and committed to level the pay for men’s and women’s national team players. The women will receive annual raises through 2023, when their earnings for national team service will equal that of their male compatriots. The US women’s team are involved in their own dispute with their federation over equal pay. De Boer, it is fair to say, has differing views.Since departing Europe for America, De Boer has had a close look at the United States as a burgeoning football country, its potential and what is holding it back. He says it is important for more senior American players to make inroads abroad. But he is an Ajax man, so he points to the nation’s youth as the key to unlocking greater success for MLS and the US men’s national team.“The big clubs, they started their own academy,” he says. “I think that’s important. The age between seven and 14 is so important. The basic techniques are in that, and afterwards it’s mentality. Tactically, between seven and 14 or six and 14, they have to have good coaches and understand the basic things of football: control the ball, know where the ball is, those kinds of things. … If everybody’s doing that, the level will go up, because we can fish in a bigger lake to get the best players.“Every league starts with homegrown players. The other leagues have much more history so I think still it takes decades to really come to that standard level. But I think we have to try to come there, because we have to try to get – every year we want to raise our bar from a club’s point of view, but also as MLS, as the federation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea3a104aa7f985d75d2a74929d65294357321288/1044_261_936_561/master/936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fd0bb1d3ed67482d416078cf147e229","title":"david squires on the premier leagues return friends and the eye of saurinho","story":"Our cartoonist casts his eye over the opening round of games, including Chelsea’s 4-0 defeat and VAR Wars at the London Stadium"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd9c6ec38f5201d8cd35483ba0d5dbbbca279e83/0_79_3634_2181/master/3634.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00be7c52dd059e978135d4b8955261dc","title":"trauma child domestic workers pakistan","story":"Despite shocking reports of abuse and a social media outcry, there is little sign of stricter laws to protect children Each night, after a 12-hour shift of domestic drudgery, Neelum, 11, and Pari, 13, leave their employer’s million-dollar mansion with its manicured lawns in Karachi’s glitzy Defence neighbourhood, and return to their servant lodgings. There they sleep on thin, termite-infested mattresses, under-nourished from their diet of leftovers.Behind the glistening glass doors of the country’s most opulent neighbourhood, thousands of children work as maids and servants. Across Pakistan, an estimated 264,000 children are employed in such work, and claims of abuse by employers are commonplace. In January, 16-year-old maid Uzma Bibi was allegedly tortured and murdered by her employer in Lahore for helping herself to a small piece of meat. After tweets about her case went viral under the hashtag #justiceforUzma, three people, including her employer, were arrested and are now in custody awaiting trial.There was similar social media outcry in 2018 over pictures of 10-year-old Tayyaba’s bruised face and hands. She had been working as a maid for a judge and his wife. The couple were cleared of assault allegations but convicted of neglecting an injured child and sentenced to one year in jail.Yet despite this rising tide of public outrage, activists say the problem is only intensifying. “The situation is actually getting worse,” says Ume Laila, executive director of rights group HomeNet Pakistan. “Children are employed with no protection and unless there is a holistic legal framework for the protection of domestic workers, the situation won’t improve. Awareness and practical actions are required.”“No amount of outpouring of support on social media on an issue of this kind translates into any far-reaching positive results in Pakistan,” says child rights activist Fazela Gulrez. “The most that happens is a law is passed with much fanfare, which looks very pretty in the state reports presented in the UN or other platforms but changes nothing on the ground. The immediate reaction could be intense but remains temporary. So, in reality, nothing has changed.”A major obstacle is that child work is so normalised in Pakistan. But stricter child protection laws are not in the interests of many of those hiring children as their servants. “It’s not only the wealthiest and most powerful who are employing child domestic workers,” says Gulaz. “They are employed across the board, whoever can afford to employ them. Many people prefer young workers, because they are easier to control, and exploit. And poor parents are ever ready to offer their children for employment because it at least promises two meals and a roof. Nothing else matters.”The Punjab Domestic Workers Act, passed this year, includes an emphasis on discouraging child labour. Yet there are no similar laws in other provinces, and campaigners say that unless laws enhance accountability among employers, children will continue to be exploited.Humaira’s story is typical of the abuse that can take place behind closed doors. A child when she started domestic work and now in her 20s, she says she was burned by her employers, and then hidden away so that no one would know. “I was 10 and severely malnourished. I could barely lift the children, who regularly abused me – sometimes verbally, other times physically.”She says that the parents, through positive reinforcement, encouraged their children’s “playful” behaviour. “One time, while I was playing with the children, boiling water was thrown my way, scorching my entire upper body. I couldn’t walk properly. My employers panicked but refused to take me to hospital. I was hidden for days and not allowed to speak to anyone.” Eventually, Humaira was rescued by a neighbour, offered medical help and reunited with her family.Despite the well-documented risks, extreme poverty means parents are still tempted to send children away. Agents entice them with talk of the financial benefits, often offering false reassurances about how they will look out for the children while they are away from home.Without proper worker protection, in cases of abuse, dissent is often silenced through “hush money”. This happened in the case of Bano, a 13-year-old girl working in Bahria Town in Rahim Yar Khan. She was thrown out of a window by her employer and her backbone was irreparably damaged, leading to her death six months later. Instead of pursuing the matter in court, her father agreed to a settlement with the employer worth 300,000 Pakistani rupees (£1,490)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7249d976cdd22d8cd0c55633702c1086737d15d/0_161_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eeaf568043bcf5df7a791aa874b9783","title":"joy despair and determination photographs from kibera","story":"Despite its poverty, Kibera is a vibrant place where people survive in testing conditions, both physical and mental.

You line up your face to a virtual mask and it snaps a picture of you to analyse. The mirror is a mirror – unless you choose to magnify your face by x2 or a horrific x3, in which case it switches to a tablet-style camera in selfie mode. It displays weather and news snippets. (Deeply weird to be given the latest on Kashmir when obsessing over your pores.) You can connect to Spotify and watch beauty tutorials on YouTube.I’m a sucker for this kind of fluid futurism – and, unlike many overengineered devices, it works beautifully. When I turn it on, a purple sprite formed of bubbles winks at me, as if I’m taking a wee break from reality. By default, the sides of the mirror illuminate in clear white, although they turn warm and orange if you select the “Makeup studio” option. You can even try virtual makeup effects using augmented reality.The interface is stunning. My face, however, is not. It’s hard, being informed how rough you are on a daily basis, that you rate “poor” for dark spots but “average” for wrinkles. This information is tracked via projected graphs. The data is meant to indicate whether your skincare regime is working, which many people will love. As far as I’m concerned, the mirror might as well be shouting: “Come get some ham, Fatty Boom-Boom,” first thing in the morning.None of this is a healthy way for anyone to think of themselves. Body fat and basal metabolic rate may be interesting to gym bunnies, but should we care what our muscle mass, bone weight or water percentage is? You are not training for Tokyo 2020. You can like yourself without those numbers, or hate yourself when you are “winning”. It is impressive how the scale reads body composition from only an electric current, but frankly it is too much data. Staring at the chasm between yourself and your beauty ideals won’t bring you any closer to achieving them. If x3 magnification isn’t enough, how about x6, or x160? If you don’t like yourself, there will always be more ground to make up.From an engineering perspective, HiMirror is extraordinary. You could lose hours with it. Is such a use of time more important than nurturing your abilities and talents? Give me strength. And a bigger arse.The mirror and the scale both require a mains connection, which is just too much cable.

While Lifestyle Club LSC marketed the properties – aimed at young overseas renters – tenants’ contracts were with Lifestyle Club Ltd. The terms and conditions reserved the right to evict tenants with seven days’ notice instead of the 28-84 days required by the Tenancy Act.Its terms and conditions allowed its agents the right to enter private rooms unannounced at any time while banning visits from non-members. It required tenants to maintain and replace appliances at their own expense, leave any furniture they had paid for when they moved out and levied large fees for “breaches” of membership.One group of flat sharers was charged £90 for leaving unwashed dishes in the sink. The companies’ self-employed agents were charged similar levies for breaching sales targets or taking time off.Last week the director of Lifestyle Club Ltd, Gian Paolo Aliatis, was required to pay £42,273 in fines, compensation and costs after pleading guilty to three charges of unfair commercial practice. In a prosecution brought by Islington Trading Standards in London, Aliatis admitted passing the lettings agency off as a membership club to avoid the legal regulations for lettings agents.Under the law, tenants’ deposits must be refundable and paid into a tenancy deposit protection scheme. Aliatis admitted that his firm demanded a non-refundable “joining” fee. He also admitted pressuring customers into signing a “membership agreement” without giving them time to read and understand the document, and denying potential tenants the chance to view a property before signing. Rental payments were passed off as a “monthly contribution fee”.While letting agents are required by law to belong to a registered redress scheme, Lifestyle Club Ltd instead directed anyone who raised a complaint to a fake independent mediation company. Diarmaid Ward, Islington Council’s executive member for housing and development, said: “This is a major victory for private tenants, not just in Islington but right across the country. Our determined trading standards team has led to a landmark prosecution sending a clear message – simply changing a few words in the paperwork does not put you above the law.”In March, Lifestyle Club LSC was fined £22,299 and its director Tiina Lehtla separately fined £7,983.33 in a court case brought by neighbouring Camden Council.The company was found guilty of ignoring a statutory requirement to supply the council with details of the property management and the tenancy contracts for two unlicensed, unsafe multi-occupancy homes in London.In his summing up, the judge accused the defendants of putting safety at risk to maximise revenue. “They did not apply for licences in the hope of avoiding an inspection, which would have resulted in expense to bring the properties up to standard,” he said. “The tenants were from abroad and the most in need. They were given ‘membership’ agreements instead of tenancy agreements in an attempt to curtail their rights.“The obstruction of the local authority, by not returning the statutory notices, was deliberate, and a commercial decision to try and frustrate the investigation by environmental health officers.”Lifestyle Club Ltd went into voluntary liquidation in February and Lifestyle Club LSC faces being struck off the Companies House register."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cfefbb7b75220e342615966f805123a9a84b8e7/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1b33f06fe25c9fbac67f6a4a0d7ade9","title":"quiz identify these pop superstars","story":"Trevor Nelson thinks modern chart-toppers aren’t as familiar to fans as the likes of Bowie and Bush.

He was speaking after meeting Boris Johnson and senior British officials in London on Monday.“The ultimate end result is a comprehensive trade agreement covering all trading goods and services,” Bolton said. “But to get to that you could do it sector by sector, and you can do it in a modular fashion. In other words, you can carve out some areas where it might be possible to reach a bilateral agreement very quickly, very straightforwardly.”In other areas, such as financial services, he said deals might be more difficult to reach.It is the first time the US has suggested smaller deals could be reached before a comprehensive agreement, and underlines its stance towards the UK as it faces the potential consequences of trade barriers being raised with the EU, the UK’s largest export market. Previously, the US has resisted sectoral deals with the EU.Bolton, in a briefing with reporters, repeatedly underlined the US administration’s Eurosceptic tendencies by saying he and Trump were “leavers before there were leavers”. “If there was a no-deal Brexit, that would be a decision of the British government. We would support it enthusiastically,” he said.His chief message on the trip, Bolton continued, was to convey Trump’s desire to see a successful British exit from the EU, adding: “We are with you.” The Johnson-Trump relationship, he said, had “got off to a roaring start” with five phone calls since the British prime minister was elected leader of the Conservative party 18 days ago.“Britain’s success in successfully exiting the European Union will be a statement about democratic rule and constitutional government,” Bolton said. “That’s important for Britain. But it’s important for the United States, too. So we see a successful exit as being very much in our interest, and there’s no quid pro quo on any of these issues.”Asked to expand on this assessment, he continued: “The fashion in the European Union is when the people vote the wrong way from the way the elites want to go, is to make the peasants vote again and again until they get it right. There was a vote – everyone knew what the issues were. It is hard to imagine that anyone in this country did not know what was at stake. The result is the way it was. That’s democracy.”In March 2018 John Bolton, a longtime foreign policy hawk, was named as Trump’s third national security adviser in just 14 months. Over a three-decade career in foreign policy, he has advocated frequent use of military force and disdained diplomacy and international institutions.Before joining the Trump administration, he was best known for a brief stint as president George W Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations – a body he openly sneered at. His role came to an end because the Senate would not confirm him.Bolton has called for bombing both North Korea and Iran. Less than a month before his appointment by Trump, he penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed making “the legal case for striking North Korea first.He seems to have played a key role in the collapse of the second Trump summit with Kim Jong-un in February, when he appeared to have drafted a maximalist list of demands for all-or-nothing disarmament that was presented to the North Korean dictator in Hanoi. A year of diplomacy ground to a halt with Kim, who had been expecting a more gradualist approachBolton was a harsh critic of the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump pulled out of, and went further, advocating military force against the country. A bombing campaign was the only way to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, he wrote in another op-ed.Bolton has seized the initiative in the fast-moving escalation of tensions with Tehran during 2019, spinning military deployments in the Gulf that were already in the pipeline as confrontational steps against Tehran, and reportedly irritating some in the Pentagon and intelligence agencies by putting a sensationalist spin on intelligence about Iranian military movements.In the standoff in Venezuela, Bolton was again centre stage, making himself the lead US voice for a failed effort at regime change in Venezuela in late April, producing a personal video appeal calling – in vain – on Nicolás Maduro’s top aides to defect. Behind the scenes he has urged a reluctant US Southern Command to come up with ever more aggressive solutions to Maduro’s hold on power.In the past he has also opposed the International Criminal Court in the Hague. As undersecretary of state under George W Bush, he travelled around the world negotiating two-way agreements in which countries pledged not to send US officials to the court. He also forcefully opposed the UN security council referring suspected genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan to the court, though the United States ultimately sat out that vote and the referral went forward.Bolton grew up in a working-class Republican family in Baltimore, and his first political experience was as a volunteer in the doomed 1964 campaign of Barry Goldwater, a staunch conservative from Arizona. He attended Yale University. Unlike many of his fellow students, he fiercely supported the war effort in Vietnam, but not to the point of taking part himself. He avoided the draft by joining the Maryland national guard.\u0026nbspBolton held senior positions in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and the elder George Bush, and wrote a book summing up his views: Surrender Is Not An Option.He is derided by critics as a warmonger, but defines his own philosophy as “Americanist” – a close cousin to Trump’s “America First” slogan – and is no fan of traditional carrot and stick diplomacy. “I don’t do carrots,” he has said.He brushed aside suggestions, made by the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, that a no-deal Brexit might endanger the Good Friday agreement by reinstating a hard border on the island of Ireland. He said there was no threat to the agreement that he could see.Britain, he said, was “not going to crash out even if there is a no-deal exit. World Trade Organization rules apply. So we’ve got lots of agreements, bilateral and some multilateral within that context, that can be used as models”.On Iran and other security issues, such as Huawei’s involvement in 5G networks, Bolton said the message the US wanted to convey was that “the US government fully understands that in the next 80 days the UK government has a singular focus on the Brexit issue, so that we’re not pushing for anything on these broad and complex questions”.However, he claimed the UK had agreed to go back to stage one on Chinese telecommunications company Huawei, an assessment not shared later by British officials.Lewis Lukens, who served as deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in London until earlier this year, said Bolton might publicly be saying the UK should prioritise Brexit but there would be pressure behind the scenes for it to “get on board” with American policy on China, Iran and trade.Jack Straw, the former Labour foreign secretary, described Bolton as “far right” and said he was taking the “crude and vulgar view that might is right”. He said the US would be making huge demands on Johnson’s new administration in return for a trade deal.“This is a highly transactional administration. Strictly business – you do not get something for nothing,” he told the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme. Bolton said the UK had abandoned plans for a separate European maritime security force in the Gulf, saying it had instead recognised it would have to come on board with Operation Sentinel, a US-led maritime force in the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman.In his last act as foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt had proposed a separate EU force, but his successor, Dominic Raab, has said that such a force separate from US assets and surveillance abilities may not be viable.More broadly, Bolton saw a chance for the UK to leverage itself away from European foreign policy once it left the EU: “In terms of Britain’s overall policy, foreign policy, by definition, once it leaves the EU on 31 October, it won’t be bound by the requirement to seek the common foreign security policy with the European Union. It will be pursuing UK national interest as it sees them.”An independent UK voice would lead to a stronger Nato, he predicted. “This is something that would be incredibly valuable for the United States and for the western alliance as a whole.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7020e7ebce0a943ddd01376adb62c14c9720dfb8/0_933_5906_3543/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89c12fd54eee41cc89249b1fcd23f87b","title":"brexit remain radicalisation fbpe peoples vote","story":"They hate Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. They no longer trust the BBC. They love civil servants, legal experts and James O’Brien. And now, consumed by the battle against Brexit, hardcore remainers are no longer the moderates. By  Daniel CohenOn 25 October 2017, a pensioner living in the Netherlands created a new hashtag. Hendrik Klaassens was concerned about the rise of Europe’s far right and wanted to bring campaigners together on Twitter. He settled on #FBPE: “Follow Back Pro EU”. Klaassens didn’t specifically have Britain in mind, but within a few days of his tweet, anti-Brexit Twitter accounts started using the hashtag. Before long, they were adding it to their usernames, so that it would appear whenever they tweeted. And in late November, when Mike Galsworthy, an influential anti-Brexit campaigner, posted a widely shared video on Twitter urging his followers to embrace it, #FBPE really took off. It wasn’t a memorable hashtag, but it didn’t need to be. The people consumed by their resistance to Brexit now had their own way to communicate, to find each other in the crowd.Today, Klaassens estimates that 15,000 people still use the hashtag, most of them in the UK. Their tweets have always see-sawed between defiance and distress, but in the weeks since Boris Johnson became prime minister – as they have become convinced that Britain is in the midst of a rightwing coup – they have grown increasingly despairing.The #FBPE brigade can appear locked in an arms race to out-remain each other. The descriptions that accompany their profiles are furnished with Brexiter slurs they’ve reappropriated (“remoaner”, “saboteur”), lists of the European countries they’ve lived in, and plainspoken declarations of devotion (“Remain – all the way through like a stick of rock”). They have come under attack from all sides: they are derided by Brexit supporters for being sore losers mocked, even by many who voted remain, for their fanaticism and earnestness. Yet for this online tribe, #FBPE is more than a badge of solidarity – it has given them an identity.#FBPE is just one sect in a wider movement that was born the day Britain voted to leave the EU. Before the referendum, it felt as if the only people who really cared about the EU were the ones who wanted to leave it. But a week after Britain voted out, tens of thousands of people massed in Parliament Square. Protesters waved the EU flag, draped themselves in it, painted it on their faces. All the affection for Europe that had been unvoiced during the referendum campaign was suddenly coming out in a rush. Belatedly, a new movement had been born: remainism.When they’re not soaking up anti-Brexit memes on Twitter, remainists can read The New European, a pro-EU newspaper, and anti-Brexit novels by Ali Smith and Jonathan Coe. They can listen to podcasts like My Parents Voted Brexit and Remainiacs, and if they’re looking for some remain-themed music, they can put on a recent album by The Matthew Herbert Brexit Big Band, which includes samples of Gibraltarian monkeys, a swimmer crossing the Channel and a Ford Fiesta being scrapped.Before the referendum, many of the people who have become remainists considered themselves immune to the passions of politics. They tended to hover around the centre ground and didn’t strongly identify with any party. They were used to being on the inside, to being listened to. But since 23 June 2016, remainists have found themselves out in the cold. “I just felt everything I believed in was stolen from me,” Angela Ramsall, a prominent anti-Brexit voice, better known on Twitter as @spaceangel1964, told me.Remainists feel embattled, ignored they lament what their country has become. They feel that the politicians who are meant to be on their side, and the media organisations that are meant to present facts impartially, have betrayed them. The system that had seemed to function, more or less, has broken down. Steve Deacon, a protester I met on a People’s Vote march earlier this year, was at Glastonbury festival when he heard the referendum result. Before then, he had felt that “the world had been marching forward, and things were getting better incrementally”. But since that day, it no longer seems that way to him.These are the kinds of sentiments that have come to be associated with leavers – the idea that the country had been going in the wrong direction, that it had become unrecognisable. But after the referendum, they were suddenly being voiced by remainists. “It was just so reminiscent of how radical-right voters would think,” says Rob Ford, a political scientist at the University of Manchester who has researched the rise of Ukip. “And it was remarkable how quickly that mindset descended.”And so these people, who once dismissed radicals as unreasonable, have themselves become radicalised. They used to pride themselves on their moderation now, spurred on by rage, they ide the world into enemies and allies. What they are doing is loud, obsessive, tribal, confrontational – politics, in other words.Three years in, remainists can’t claim any concrete victories, but their fundamental demand – stopping Brexit – is now firmly in the mainstream. They have helped set the new conventional wisdom that Labour faces electoral wipeout if it doesn’t commit to a second referendum within the party, the pressure for holding another vote looks unstoppable. Only a few months ago, remainists seemed to be ascendant: each protest was bigger than the last, each delay to Brexit bought them more time. But Theresa May’s resignation changed that. Remainists faded into the background over the summer, as the Conservative leadership election sucked up all the oxygen. Now, with Johnson in No 10, the Brexiters are once again on the front foot. As 31 October approaches, the remainists are running out of time – and anything less than staying in Europe will devastate them. “It’s going to be like a bereavement for me,” says Helen Harris-Burland, a campaigner from the Chilterns.Remainists often describe Brexit as a distraction from the real problems Britain faces – austerity, inequality, a creaking NHS. Yet those problems existed long before the referendum, without galvanising most remainists in the way Brexit has. For many remainists, in fact, it can feel as if everything else is a distraction: what drives them on is their belief that Brexit is the battle of a lifetime. Through a bruising, often disillusioning process, they have acquired a better idea of what matters to them, and how to get it. “It’s been a fault of mine not being involved in politics before,” Harris-Burland says. “Since Brexit, I’ve learned a huge amount about how the country works – and it’s not very favourable.” Europe is the terrain on which this has all taken place. But for remainists, just like leavers, the argument is really about Britain: the country they thought they were living in, and the country they want it to be.Just as only a fraction of the people who supported Margaret Thatcher could be called Thatcherite, voting remain is not enough to make you a remainist. Remainists are the people who keep bringing the conversation back to Brexit. They point out that the referendum was only ever meant to be advisory, and insist that another one is just around the corner. They go on protests. They have strong opinions about Guy Verhofstadt and Sabine Weyand. They worry about chlorinated chicken. They have acquired detailed knowledge of electoral law and can list the leave campaign’s violations. They light up at any mention of the 2012 Olympics. They wonder what Orwell would have made of all this. They hang the EU flag in their windows. (There is a group of remainists who call themselves EU Flag Mafia, and perform stunts such as hanging dozens of flags from poles in the sea off Southend, like a gang of centrist situationists.)There are plenty of remainist groups: one, Wooferendum, even mobilises dogs against Brexit. The People’s Vote campaign is the behemoth at the heart of organised remainism – so much so that it has become a kind of byword for resistance to Brexit. Launched last year by Open Britain, the successor to the official remain campaign in 2016, it has brought different, sometimes overlapping remainist organisations together under one roof (literally: they share office space in Westminster’s Millbank Tower). There’s the People’s Vote brand itself, with its own local offshots and national marches the two big grassroots groups, Britain for Europe and the European Movement, which work side by side. And then there are the specialist organisations that now come under the People’s Vote umbrella – the likes of Our Future Our Choice (Ofoc) and Scientists for EU. If People’s Vote, with its Westminster ties and celebrity supporters, represents the pinnacle of slick establishment remainism, then Sodem (which stands for Stand of Defiance European Movement, and is pronounced “sod ’em”), is more homespun. Somewhere in the middle lies Led By Donkeys, a four-man band who have produced billboards featuring damning quotes from Brexiter politicians (Nigel Farage, May 2016: “in a 52-48 referendum this would be unfinished business by a long way”), earning them a place in the remainist pantheon.Ask a remainist what motivates them and they’ll talk about the EU: its role in maintaining peace, the importance of countries working together for prosperity. They will smile wistfully as they recount teenage trips to Europe or their time spent studying there. Older remainists will mention fathers who fought in the second world war, to stress that a peaceful, united Europe can never be taken for granted.There is an antagonistic strain in remainism that is just as important as this idealism. “Europeanism has always been more anti-Eurosceptic than pro-European,” says Robert Saunders, a historian at Queen Mary University of London. And what fuels remainists, three years into the Brexit process, is anger. They hate the people you’d expect them to hate: Johnson, Farage, Jacob Rees-Mogg, “Andrea Loathsome”, to use one of their schoolboyish nicknames. They hate them for their lies, and their “cakeism”, the Johnsonian insistence that we really can have our cake and eat it: that Britain could leave the single market, say, without losing any of the benefits of being part of it. (One remainist podcast is called Cake Watch.)Most of all, remainists hate the way the Brexiters keep getting away with it. Remainists hated Theresa May by the end increasingly, they hate Jeremy Corbyn, too. Matt Kelly, the editor of The New European, considers this is a reasonable, pragmatic reaction to the failures of Britain’s ruling class. “If someone’s behaving in an extreme and bizarre manner then I think being pissed off is absolutely the appropriate response,” he says. “The anger comes in waves – and it’s pretty tsunami-esque at the moment.”Remainists tend to put their faith not in politicians, but in bureaucrats and civil servants. But they make an exception for those MPs, such as Dominic Grieve or Yvette Cooper (even though she doesn’t back a second referendum), who are willing to rebel against the party leadership or reach out to the opposite benches. Remainists wish these kinds of “grownups” – seemingly responsible, competent people, capable of putting the national interest above ambition and petty rivalries – could clean up the mess. This is a vision, however fanciful, of politics without politicking. Once the grownups come to the rescue, it suggests, the rest of us can retreat, safe in the knowledge that everything is under control. Remainists look enviously at Europe, longing for a leader of their own – a Merkel, a Macron, a Tusk – to deliver Britain from Brexit.At the People’s Vote protest in March, that craving was clear: among the protesters, I spotted a woman with a handwritten “En Marche!” sticker on her sleeve. The demonstration was the biggest show of support for remainism yet: somewhere between 300,000 and a million people marched through central London. That morning, I travelled to the protest from Bristol, one of the first places where the seeds of remainism sprouted, on a train chartered by local anti-Brexit groups, which they called “the People’s Vote Express”. One campaigner wandered through the carriages selling EU flags out of an Ikea bag.Halfway down the train, I started talking to Finbarr O’Halloran, a warm, rosy-cheeked man who was carrying a Led by Donkeys placard. His story was a textbook case of remainist radicalisation. “I’d been fairly apolitical throughout my life, just letting them get on with it as long as the country was run in a reasonably sensible manner,” he told me. “And it’s only the craziness of Brexit that’s made me mad.”O’Halloran was particularly infuriated by the misinformation, from politicians and the media, that he blamed for Brexit. “Forty years of lying have been done by the mainstream media to the British public,” he said. He wasn’t just thinking of the rightwing press. “Unfortunately, the BBC is no longer a source of truth for what’s going on in the country.” This has become a signature lament for remainists, who accuse the broadcaster of pro-Brexit bias. Andrew Adonis, a Labour peer and anti-Brexit campaigner, has been particularly critical of what he calls the “public disservice broadcaster”. He tweeted in May that “BBC News is so debased and biased, it should be replaced by a new independent news service”.Remainists are the kind of people who used to rely on the BBC, and defend it against attacks from the left and right. Now they feel it is just one more institution that has failed them. So they have to look elsewhere – and, in many cases, Twitter has filled that void. AC Grayling, a philosopher who has become one of the most outspoken remainists, described to me how he spends half an hour on Twitter first thing each morning, while on his exercise bike or treadmill. “Normally I start off quite slowly,” he said. But as he gets annoyed by the latest Brexit news, he finds himself going faster and faster.Echo chambers like Twitter are important to remainists, as they are to all recent political movements. By providing a space for like-minded souls to furiously agree with each other and rage at the other side’s idiocy, Twitter has helped remainists forge a common language, a shared story, an unmistakeably clear message – the things a political movement needs in order to take root. That effect is amplified by the rest of the remainist media: opening a copy of the New European provides that same feeling of being somewhere that is deliberately, happily, a bubble. In its first year, the paper readily baited leavers. More recently, though, it has dialled down the vitriol and settled into an exasperated sarcasm – a typical remainist mode.As you flick through the New European, you eventually leave Brexit behind for something that would have been unthinkable before 2016: the “Eurofile” section, a weekly paean to Europe and its glories. Another section makes for an equally odd sight in a British newspaper: pages of articles by academics, under the heading “Expertise”.Expertise matters to remainists. They don’t merely admire it – that admiration is an important part of how they define themselves. “A lot of remainers are proud to say that they embrace complexity,” says Ian Dunt, a journalist and presenter of Remainiacs. At the People’s Vote march, a man in a lab coat was handing out flyers on behalf of Scientists for EU: “for those who believe in experts,” he said.In their hunger for expertise, remainists have gravitated towards lawyers, such as David Allen Green and Jolyon Maugham, who have become celebrities in their corner of Twitter. Allen Green, a solicitor and legal commentator, plays the clear-eyed realist, slightly outside the fray Maugham, a tax barrister, windmill enthusiast and hardened critic of Jeremy Corbyn, is more of a troublemaker, like a maverick general lobbing grenades and plotting sorties. For remainists, lawyers – and trade experts such as Dmitry Grozoubinski and David Henig – are an antidote to “cakeism”: with their understanding of how the world really works, they are the ones best equipped to lay bare the madness of Brexit.Behind this solemn reverence for experts lies the belief, or at least the forlorn hope, that if leavers were only forced to confront the facts on Brexit, they would be overwhelmed by the weight of evidence. It’s a view reinforced by listening to James O’Brien’s radio show. Within the remainist ecosystem, O’Brien is simultaneously the star pupil, the most popular kid in class and the playground bully: remainists worship him for the way he shreds leavers’ arguments. As his impatience mounts, he drops his head in his hands – a pose that encapsulates how it feels to be a remainist today. “Can we all agree that it’s time to rename remain and leave?” he tweeted earlier this year. “I suggest right and wrong.”What is surprising, looking back at the months after the referendum defeat, is how muted the initial remainist response was, once the immediate outpouring of grief had passed. “The grassroots was virtually zero,” says Angela Ramsall. One group that did emerge shortly after the referendum, Bristol for Europe, set up a weekly stall to campaign for another vote. “We got a lot of hostility,” says Eileen Means, one of the group’s founders. “We were told we were like flat earthers.” Activists described to me the loneliness they felt in those early days. “So many people said to me after the advisory referendum, ‘give up, you lost. Get over it,’” says a spokesman, who asked not to be named, from EU Flag Mafia.At Westminster, too, few MPs gave remainism the time of day. Even politicians who are now ardent remainists were resistant. In December 2016, Chuka Umunna urged campaigners to stop calling for a second referendum. In the absence of leadership from MPs, figures from outside party politics filled the void. Most prominent was Gina Miller, the fund manager who argued that it would be illegal to invoke article 50 without a parliamentary vote, and launched a case that ended up in the high court. Miller signalled to remainists that it was no use sitting around, waiting for the grownups to show up: they would have to roll up their sleeves and get stuck in themselves. By addressing Brexit through the courts, like the other legal challenges that followed, Miller was aligning remainism with the pillars of stability and order: the constitution, the rule of law. It was a way of doing politics that could pose as unpolitical.When Theresa May called a snap general election in April 2017, “it felt like a particularly bleak moment,” says Jolyon Maugham. In response, he came up with the idea of launching Spring, a new party. “I wanted to find a way for those who felt like I did to stand together and say: ‘This is not who we are,’” he said. His plans were big. He would hold a 28-day festival at the football stadium in Maidenhead, May’s constituency. Each day would be dedicated to the national dress and cuisine of a different EU member state. For the finale, Maugham planned to announce that he was standing in Maidenhead as a Spring candidate.In the end, Maugham decided he didn’t have enough time to go ahead with it. But throughout 2017 it felt as if every remainist was toying with the idea of starting a party. In August, James Chapman, a former aide to George Osborne and David Davis, proposed setting up the Democrats. A couple of months later, Jeremy Cliffe, an Economist journalist, sounded out his Twitter followers to see if they were interested in a possible new anti-Brexit party. Emails of support flooded in: without really intending to, he had launched the Radicals, “pro-tech, pro-Europe, social-liberal” – and, ultimately, short-lived. While Chapman limited his platform to stopping Brexit, Cliffe’s was a fever dream of technocratic renewal: he wanted to scrap VAT, abolish the green belt and introduce Swedish-style social insurance.By then, remainism was starting to gather momentum. The election result had given remainists some hope: by depriving the Conservatives of a majority, it left May facing a trickier path to Brexit. And while younger remainists had been a quieter presence until this point, that started to change in October, when a 23-year-old activist arrived at a Brussels press conference dressed as a Brexit-fighting superhero.Madeleina Kay’s outfit – EU stars encircling the Superman symbol – caused such a stir that she was thrown out of the conference. But she now had a nickname, EU Supergirl, which stuck, even as she went on to dress up as Wonder Woman, a policewoman, and the Queen of Hearts, all in the service of stopping Brexit. Her cult following was boosted by the music videos she posted online: occupying the naffer edges of remainism, they include the kind of love songs or break-up ballads one might hear at an open-mic night, but addressed to the EU (“always thought you were the problem, now I see the problem was me”). Soon after Kay’s arrival on the scene, at the end of 2017, four campaigners in their 20s – among them Femi Oluwole, whose videos and tireless tweeting have made him a remainist celebrity – set up Our Future Our Choice to mobilise students and make the case for why Brexit will hurt young people.The young occupy a special place in the remainist psyche. On the People’s Vote march, there were protesters who put the names, or even photos, of their grandchildren on placards. At remain meetings I attended over recent months, many attendees backed giving a vote to 16- and 17-year-olds if another referendum takes place. And even elderly remainists delight in pointing out that as many as a million leave voters have died since 2016, believing that this tips the balance in remain’s favour.Of course, the young symbolise the future of the country – the very future that Brexit threatens. Yet behind these concerns for the future lies a more old-fashioned worldview. It’s leavers who are typically accused of indulging imperial nostalgia, by insisting that Brexit will revive Britain’s bygone greatness. But you can find that same nostalgia in remainists’ fear that leaving the EU will finish off whatever greatness remains. In the words of Michael Heseltine – who, as a Tory grandee who voted Lib Dem in the European elections, represents the Platonic form of a “grownup” – Brexit would mean Britain “voluntarily stepping down from its position of world pre-eminence”.Some of this same nostalgia seems to inform the familiar lament about how far Britain has fallen, reducing itself to a laughing stock on the world stage. But the real embarrassment for remainists is not how the rest of the world views Britain – it is seeing their own country ruled by politicians who have parted ways with reason and decency. They shudder at every new degradation Britain faces, while also accepting it as the inevitable fulfillment of their warnings. The Irish journalist Fintan O’Toole has described Brexit as a masochistic project but, as leavers are fond of pointing out, remainists have a masochistic streak of their own. The most zealous remainists give the impression of relishing each morsel of bad news – growth slowing, a car plant closing – as if willing on the damage that confirms their worst fears. Like revolutionaries striving to heighten the contradictions, they believe that only then will leave voters see the error of their ways, and the politicians who deceived them get what they deserve.As much as remainists worry about the future, they see themselves on the right side of history. “It is inevitable that pro-EU attitudes will grow,” says AC Grayling. “If we were to leave, it wouldn’t be for very long in historical terms. Maybe five or 10 years.” That makes Brexit a blip – a glitch in the system, destined to be righted. When I asked remainists if they were worried about what might happen if Brexit were stopped – how leave voters could react to the result of the referendum being rejected – no one seemed too concerned. Much as remainists claim to champion complexity, their own optimism is not so different from the kind currently coming out of No 10: it is as if the past three years could be magicked away, Brexit and its supporters bypassed, at little enduring cost.For much of his career, Andrew Adonis was the kind of politician who felt more comfortable in the background. As a peer, he was even able to become a Labour minister without being elected. But by the end of 2017, he felt that no one was really making the case against Brexit. “Just as the country was in danger of literally going over the cliff, I felt it was my duty to weigh in,” he told me, over coffee at Millbank House in Westminster. So Adonis threw himself into campaigning. (Earlier this year, when he ran unsuccessfully for the European parliament, he squandered some of his remainist capital by briefly backing Labour’s plans to carry out Brexit.)On a bright Thursday evening in April, I saw Adonis speak at a Lambeth for Europe event in south London. Lambeth voted remain by a bigger margin than any other area in the UK, and Adonis drew a rapt crowd of a hundred-odd people. Wearing a brown suit and a turquoise shirt, Adonis resembled a 1970s university lecturer (he worked briefly as an academic), and there was something teacherly in the way he addressed the audience. Amid figures on Britain’s trade with the EU, and references to the intricacies of the withdrawal agreement, he explained why all proposals – apart from a second referendum – were, ultimately, doomed.Adonis defines remainism as a revolt of the middle class – and that is why he believes that, in the end, Brexit won’t happen. “The English middle class, deeply alarmed, will be heard and will win,” he told me. “That’s my whole experience of politics.” Remainism is seen, not entirely unfairly, as an unusually middle-class protest movement, but remainists have attempted to flip that perception by branding Brexiters, or at least the politicians who speak on their behalf, as the true elite. Tweeting about Nigel Farage in March, Alastair Campbell wrote, “Dulwich College. City trader. MEP. Billionaire friends with private jets.”In a moment of crowd-pleasing populism during his talk, Adonis proposed banning anyone who had been to Eton from holding public office. Coming from a man who sits in the House of Lords, this rhetoric can feel a little hollow, but it certainly played well with the audience. Adonis peppered his talk with references to “Nigel” and “Jacob”, knowing that merely mentioning those names was enough to fire up his crowd. “Whenever Boris or Jacob Rees-Mogg make one of their speeches, we get another flush of people,” Eileen Means, from Bristol for Europe, told me.Brexit is not the kind of fight that can end in a tie or a truce. Whatever happens, at least one side will believe they have lost. And for remainists, any kind of Brexit will feel like defeat. To win, before the clock ticks down, they have to complete the project they began three years ago: convincing enough of the country that Brexit isn’t simply undesirable, but that it can – and should – be stopped.They have already travelled quite a distance. The rise in support for a second referendum could never have happened without the work of campaigners and groups like People’s Vote. Merely repeating their message isn’t what got them there – what matters is the way they have shouted it. A bolshier form of remainism now prevails, as if remainists are trying to match the stridency of the Brexiters. The rallying cry “Bollocks to Brexit” is the kind of statement one might expect to hear, in tone if not content, from someone like Farage. Until recently, it would have been hard to imagine the Liberal Democrats co-opting it as their campaign slogan, as they did in the recent European elections. (Compare this to their almost parodically bland slogan at the last general election: “Change Britain’s Future”.)And it has worked, up to a point. The Lib Dems spent years fruitlessly opposing Brexit, while they languished in the polls. That started to change when they dressed themselves in the clothes of remainism, borrowing its belligerence and fire. They came second in the European election – top in London – and seized the Conservative seat of Brecon and Radnorshire in a byelection earlier this month. And they have benefited, at the same time, from the discrediting of Labour’s Brexit strategy – another remainist victory.But remainists worry that, as long as their votes are split across several parties, their influence will be limited. The Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid Cymru are now trying to remedy that. Over the next month, they plan to settle on 100 joint anti-Brexit candidates who will run at the next general election. Yet if this suggests they’re willing to put Brexit above party loyalties, there’s a limit to how far they will go. The Lib Dems’ refusal to countenance joining any kind of caretaker government with Corbyn at the helm – even if that could rule out a no-deal Brexit – confirms that remainists are continuing to do politics under the guise of putting politics aside to serve the national interest.And there are ides within the movement, even on the question that defines it. According to emails leaked to BuzzFeed in July, People’s Vote campaigners are at odds over the group’s stance on Brexit: it demands a second referendum but refuses, for now, to explicitly back remain, however obvious its allegiances may be. Then there are the biggest obstacles of all: the new prime minister, and a Labour leader who still won’t bow to remainist demands.Where will remainism’s energy go, once Brexit happens, or is somehow thwarted? Rob Ford draws a parallel with Scotland’s independence referendum in 2014. “You had a similarly intense mobilisation, a similarly intense tribal identification with both sides.” Almost five years later, he says, “people are still much more attached to the independence cause on either side than they were before the referendum happened. But the volume dial has gradually got turned down in terms of how important it is.”For remainists, it will be a test of just how radicalised they have become. Three years of resisting Brexit has taught them a fundamental lesson about politics. They now see that they are just another interest group – and if they want something, they have to fight for it themselves. That has been a painful realisation for remainists, but an invigorating one. “I’ve found a sense of moral purpose,” says Jolyon Maugham. “I think a lot of people are experiencing a similar epiphany. We are learning that there are no grownups in the room.” In different parts of the country, I met remainists who had been apolitical before 2016, and were now planning to run for one of the anti-Brexit parties – the Lib Dems, Change UK, Renew.The question, though, is whether any other cause will stir the same passion in remainists as their current struggle. This is the crux of the leftwing critique of remainism: the charge that remainists are fixated with Brexit at the expense of everything else – and that rather than seeking to transform the country for the better, they just want to turn back the clock to the time before the referendum when they didn’t have to think about politics because it didn’t impinge upon their privileged bubble. Remainists see it differently. Unless Brexit is stopped and economic calamity averted, they argue, Britain won’t have the money to pay for policies like ending austerity. “We care about those things,” Cynthia Potter, an American campaigner who lives in Cardiff, told me. “But Brexit comes first.”For now, the most committed of remainists have put their lives on hold. Madeleina Kay dropped out of university to focus on campaigning. Maugham has given up most of his legal work. Again and again, campaigners have thought that crunch time was approaching, only for the process to keep dragging on. Brexit hasn’t simply consumed its opponents it has left them in a purgatorial state, unsure of when they will finally be free.In June, almost three years to the day after the referendum, I went to Westminster for the daily protest by Sodem. The group began in September 2017, when Steve Bray, a rare-coins dealer from Port Talbot, came to London. “I only thought I’d be here for a couple of weeks, couple of months,” he told me, wearing his trademark blue-and-yellow top hat with “Stop Brexit” written across it. He started standing opposite parliament all day, waving a two-sided flag: the EU on one side, the union jack on the other. He snuck into the background of news broadcasts from Westminster, holding placards or shouting slogans. Before long, he became a kind of cult figure, and a hero to his fellow remainists: a one-man symbol of their collective defiance.As Bray’s fame grew, people started joining him. One regular protester admitted to me that when she first saw him, she thought he was mad. But she kept coming back: it was a way to feel like she was doing something, to feel less alone. When I visited Sodem, there was a small group of protesters – mostly female, mostly middle-aged. In the kind of scene that has somehow become normal in Brexit Britain, they stand, facing the traffic, while someone periodically roars “Stop Brexit!” Elspeth Williams, who runs the group’s social media, is one of the people who shows up every day. Like other Sodem protesters I spoke to, she came across as gentle, with a hint of steel. She has lived in Spain for 25 years, but since last December she has been back in the UK so she can be part of the protest. She stays nearby in a flat that she rents with Bray and a few other protesters until recently, they were on the same street as Jacob Rees-Mogg.I wondered what would happen to these people after Brexit. How might it feel to give so much of yourself to something and still come out on the losing side? Duncan Hodgkins, an army veteran and antiques dealer who now protests with Sodem full time, wasn’t optimistic: he told me he expected Brexit to go ahead. But he didn’t seem disillusioned. He glowed as he described how campaigning against it, his first taste of politics, had enriched him. “I’m so much more than the person I was before I started this,” he said. “I’ve found abilities within me that I didn’t realise I had: being able to communicate with different people, to have an actual opinion and not be scared to give it out.”At the end of the afternoon, Sodem gathered around the gate to parliament for their daily “shout”. Bray yelled into a metal loudhailer, leading them through a series of slogans – “Bollocks to Boris” and “Stop Brexit”. Afterwards, a protester told me that when she had drawn tarot cards, they showed that Britain would stay in the EU. But it wasn’t certain. “I did that six months ago,” she said. “Energies can change.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2632f51d27e65c3f5e76870b8a624474ad2c961c/809_287_1452_872/master/1452.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6982b5a7a75c8b5bed91f76e90875f4","title":"brexit weekly briefing snap election looks increasingly likely","story":"MPs plot to thwart a no-deal exit as the do-or-die rhetoric from Boris Johnson hardensWelcome to the ’s weekly Brexit briefing. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, sign up here. You can also catch our monthly Brexit Means … podcast here. And for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow’s politics live blog.Amid growing certainty that the UK is heading intentionally towards a no-deal Brexit, No 10 refused to rule out scheduling an early November election for immediately after Britain leaves the EU on 31 October if Boris Johnson loses a confidence motion.Insisting that he wanted a deal but that Theresa May’s “doesn’t work”, Johnson urged the EU to show “common sense”. But his top aide, Dominic Cummings, said the government could call elections for after 31 October and leave anyway if it loses a confidence vote.Michael Gove, in charge of no-deal preparations, ramped up the rhetoric, accusing the EU 27 of intransigence and calling it “wrong and sad”, while the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, insisted during a visit to the US that Brexit would bring “a huge series of upsides” for the UK in international trade.As the Irish government again said the backstop would not be up for renegotiation at a meeting next month between the PM and Leo Varadkar, No 10 reinforced its “do or die” Brexit message by suggesting that UK diplomats would be pulled out of the EU’s institutional structures of power in Brussels within days.It was also revealed that Johnson’s chief of staff had cancelled all leave for Downing Street advisers until 31 October, further increasing already fevered speculation about the likelihood of a snap election in the aftermath of a no-deal Brexit.Meanwhile, fears that the UK could be heading for its first recession in a decade were stoked by grim official figures showing that the economy had contracted in the second quarter – and parliamentary resistance to the JohnsonCummings plan stiffened.A cross-party group of MPs began working on a plan to thwart a no-deal Brexit on 31 October by forcing parliament to sit through the autumn recess, while Jeremy Corbyn wrote to the cabinet secretary saying a no-deal Brexit during an election campaign would be an “unprecedented, unconstitutional and anti-democratic abuse of power”.Labour said it was talking to other opposition groups about a possible rapid vote of no confidence against Boris Johnson once parliament returns in September, and the “rebel alliance” began mulling over new governments, emergency legislation, breaches of convention and court cases – while being unsure whether no deal can be averted.The Institute for Government also warned that a no-deal Brexit now appeared increasingly likely given the lack of time to secure a new agreement and of opportunities for MPs to block it.Downing Street has said it expected the cross-party alliance of rebels to precipitate the parliamentary battle on 9 September, a week after MPs return from their summer break, and did not foresee any move from the EU27 until after that.With the stage set for a historic clash between the executive and the legislature, a number of outcomes are possible. Johnson has a working majority of one and it is certainly feasible that enough Tory rebels would join opposition parties to ensure he loses a no-confidence motion. That would usher in a 14-day waiting period in which an alternative government could, in theory, be formed, but this would be unlikely to be headed by Jeremy Corbyn, who does not have sufficient cross-party support to enter No 10.There could, therefore, be some kind of “national unity” government, probably temporary, to delay Brexit until a new election or referendum – but the problem there is that it would need significant numbers of Labour and Tory MPs to break ranks, fast.Johnson might be able to force a no-deal Brexit by simply refusing to resign and letting the clock tick down, but the political pressure would be huge, and some have speculated that the Queen could be called on to, in effect, sack him.To thwart the opposition, Johnson could call a post-confidence vote election himself and decide on a polling day that falls after 31 October. That might contravene the convention of “purdah” (civil servants are not supposed to push through major policy changes during an election period), but no one is really sure.Finally, MPs could seizing control of the Commons order paper to try to delay Brexit or call a referendum. But this can only happen if there is meaningful government business on Brexit for MPs to amend, and with no deal seemingly the government’s intended course, there might not be any.For those with an interest in crystal-ball gazing, some wildly different scenarios are sketched here by assorted figures from the worlds of politics, arts and science.In the Observer, Andrew Rawnsley says Johnson’s plot to subvert democracy is more dangerous than Brexit itself, and Conservative MPs have to stop it:All possible solutions depend on there being sufficient Conservative MPs capable of remembering that Britain’s democratic fabric relies not so much on laws as assumptions that people will behave properly … If Britain crashes out of the EU in the middle of an election campaign deliberately delayed by a prime minister with no mandate, it won’t just be the constitution that will be plunged into the darkest crisis of our modern history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e7d3a86502e520b47bc6255d1b9602695ca9e75/0_296_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bd1646c6030b8314de22008031b26f8","title":"allotments share your pictures and stories","story":"Glut of green beans or a cornucopia of courgettes?

Every child deserves the chance to shine at school, and deaf children are no exception.”Kirsten Clark-Lyons’ seven-year-old daughter Indi was born with severe high-frequency hearing loss and uses hearing aids and a radio aid. Her mother said: “Ever since she started school we’ve had to fight. She’s making progress this year, but this is the first time in her academic life.“The school try, I just don’t think they really know what they’re doing. They think that because she has hearing aids that everything is fine, but it’s not like a pair of glasses. She doesn’t instantly get perfect hearing.“People keep talking about secondary schools. I don’t know where she’s going to go. I don’t know how she’s going to cope.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The percentage of pupils with a hearing impairment achieving a grade 4 or above in GCSE English and mathematics has increased in recent years.“We want to support all pupils to fulfil their potential in school, however, and we know there is more to do to support those with additional needs, which is why we have increased high-needs funding from £5bn in 2013 to £6.3bn this year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1f5f1dcaefefc5c13c752809c6aad10f6cf7582/844_197_3671_2203/master/3671.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bea63fbd3fe8d475f1ca77c424394498","title":"andy murray targets australian open","story":"Andy Murray is hoping to be back to the peak of his physical powers in time for the 2020 Australian Open after making his singles return.The former world No 1 was back on court as a singles player on Monday for the first time since having a metal plate inserted into his hip joint last January – surgery that saved his career.Although he lost 6-4, 6-4 to Richard Gasquet at the Western and Southern Open in Cincinnati, there were positive signs as Murray competed well and more importantly reported no pain in his hip afterwards.Despite that, he has still opted to not play in the US Open later this month – he will compete in the men’s and mixed doubles – as he was not allowed to delay a decision to accept a wild card at Flushing Meadows until he had more game time and practice.He intends to play a full schedule in the Asian swing of the ATP tour in the autumn and hopes to be back to his best in time for January’s Australian Open.It was in Melbourne where he played his last singles match, losing to Roberto Bautista Agut just days after announcing his intention to retire, so it would complete a remarkable turnaround for the two-time Wimbledon champion.“I think nine to 12 months after the operation is when I would expect to be getting close to the best that I can be physically – and speed wise I should be fully recovered by 12 months,” Murray told BBC Sport. “Speeds have improved, but they are quite linear speeds, and repeatable tests, whereas on a match court you are changing direction and having to react to balls and anticipate.Despite his absence from Flushing Meadows, Murray says he will be going all-out to step up his comeback, with three tournaments in Asia slated in. And he says only time on the court will get him back to his best.“I’m certainly not going to go backwards from here,” he added. “Every time I’ve practised singles so far, it’s all just been practice sets because I was trying to get back on the match court.“But once you actually get out there and start playing you realise, ’Wow,’ my return needs to get better, I need to improve my serve. I need to get myself on the practice court and work on those things specifically. It will be exciting and interesting to see how I get on.“It’s not something that’s been tried or done before in tennis. Hopefully if it goes well it will be an option for more athletes down the line.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb80447e3e71b32a29d835cedef23826e3d47d59/225_263_1113_667/master/1113.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4b1f4d2108fbfb25bd35d5c7948a7f3","title":"dale steyn south africa cricket","story":"An insult on his ODI debut from Ricky Ponting inspired the firebrand bowler to become a living legend of cricketThe first time Dale Steyn bowled to Ricky Ponting, he was a 22-year-old kid playing his very first game of 50-over cricket for South Africa. He started with a no-ball, and followed it up with a second soon after, then a third, and a fourth, until his captain Graeme Smith finally decided to pull him out of the attack.Steyn finished with five overs for 58 runs. Years later it wasn’t the pain of how poorly he had played that stayed with him but the way Ponting treated him later on, after Australia had won. He blanked him as they were shaking hands. Ponting, who was already the best batsman in the world, likely didn’t think twice about it but Steyn, who wanted to be the best bowler, never forgot the insult.“I was furious inside,” Steyn said a decade later. “I was like: ‘I am going to get this guy, I have got my eye on you, buddy. I am coming for you.’” In the next six years, Steyn dismissed Ponting six times, had him bowled, caught behind, lbw – the best of them a duck in the second Test at the Wanderers in 2011, which left Ponting sweating over his place and fretting about his technique. Steyn once said it was the most satisfying wicket he took. “Every time I play against you, I want you to remember who I am,” Steyn explained, “I want you to go to bed at night and know when you are playing South Africa tomorrow you have to face me.’”Anger is an energy. “Dale,” said his teammate Morne Morkel, “has enough of it for the two of us.” It wasn’t just Ponting, he felt the same way about all the great batsmen. “Ricky, Virat, Michael Clarke, Alastair Cook – I want them to go at night time thinking, ‘Ah, I have to face this guy tomorrow.’” Steyn got Kohli four times, Cook five, and Clarke 10, but then Clarke once made the mistake of calling Steyn a “cheat” during a game at Newlands. Now, after 15 years living inside the minds of the world’s best batsmen, Steyn has finally decided to move out. Last week he quit Test cricket, after 93 matches, with 439 wickets at just under 23 runs each.Something snapped in 2007. He had already been playing Test cricket for three years, had taken his first 51 wickets in 13 Tests at 30 runs each. That winter, New Zealand came on tour. They had a guy called Craig Cumming opening for them. A couple of years earlier Cumming had faced down the fastest spell Brett Lee ever bowled, when a couple of his deliveries had been clocked at 99mph on the speed gun. But Steyn was something else again. Not faster, but harder. “The pull and hook were shots I played through my career,” Cumming said. And he was set, on 48. “Before I knew it, I was taking off my helmet with a bit of blood pumping out my face.”Cumming retired hurt. He played another five years for Otago, but only one more Test. Steyn took 20 wickets in that series, five for 34, five for 59, four for 42, six for 49. It was the cheapest, deadliest bowling anyone had seen in more than a hundred years, since George Lohmann finished. And he was only just getting started.In the next eight years, Steyn took 351 wickets in 68 Tests, average 21, strike rate 41. Few players have taken as many wickets so cheaply, none have taken them so frequently. And Steyn did it in an era when batsmen were averaging more runs per wicket than they had done at any time since the 1940s, and quicks were conceding more runs per wicket than they had done at any time since the 1920s. There had never been a worse time to be a fast bowler.Which is why everyone else was fretting about the decline of fast bowling, worrying about whether the pitches were too flat or the bats too big or the workloads too heavy or the schedule too busy or the laws too unfair. It didn’t deter Steyn, but seemed to spur him on. The harder it got, the more it hurt, the more it hurt, the angrier he was, the angrier he was, the better he bowled. It’s why he always seemed to go so well on flat, thankless pitches in the subcontinent. “I always need that fire,” he said. “If anybody tries to extinguish that fire or make me be different, then I am not going to be any use to a team. I need the mongrel, the aggro, in my game.”He finished as the only man in history to take five-for against nine Test nations, who has, in his time, run through every team he has played against. Five for 67 against Australia at the MCG, five for 51 against England at the Wanderers, seven for 51 against India in Nagpur, he got the better of the best batsmen of his generation. He was too good for his contemporaries, so best measured, instead, against great bowlers who came before him.Steyn was just a few days ahead of his teammate Hashim Amla, who retired from all international cricket last week too. If Amla, who made 28 Test centuries, was one of the great players of his generation, then Steyn was one of the greatest, an unequivocal pick to open the bowling in a 21st-century World XI."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ecdce1b727804864891c2ac7d6efe8469657f11/0_0_4287_2572/master/4287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7644e5b0d4ca07856b94692d0f66358","title":"only 12 booked me under my real name bame performers at the fringe","story":"We asked BAME comedians, performers and  readers about their experiences at the Edinburgh fringeFor Scotland’s capital August means the rushed arrival of throngs of people in search of the quality theatre, comedy and performance arts on offer as part of Edinburgh’s month-long festival fringe. Billed as the biggest arts festival in the world, the fringe offers thousands of different shows with plenty to cater for almost any taste you might imagine. Almost.For the last two years grassroots organisation Fringe of Colour has been on a mission to highlight and rectify the lack of BAME presence at the festival. Last year Layton Williams, an actor who has appeared on BBC Three in Bad Education and on the West End as Billy Elliot, accused security staff at the Assembly George Square venue of racial profiling after they alleged that he looked like a man who had jumped the fence two weeks before. The venue eventually apologised, but Williams’ experience is not unique.Not every experience is negative, and of course the fringe also offers unimaginable opportunity for directors, producers and performers, with many considering it the highlight of their creative year. Those in charge of the fringe are also making an effort to increase inclusivity, having designated ersity as one of the key strands of this year’s fringe central programme. But is enough being done to welcome people of all backgrounds to the fringe? We asked comedians, performers and  readers about their experiences.I haven’t had any proper negative experiences unless you count the occasional hostile reaction from drunk men when I tell them I’m not Romesh Ranganathan. When I told another BAME friend that I hadn’t experienced much racism in Edinburgh, they said “It’s because you get to be Nish”. I’ve been able to exist outside of the usual micro-aggressions because of the status I have at the fringe.I have heard more stories about racism in Edinburgh from other performers over the last couple years, but I suspect that is a symptom of a wider national problem with people becoming more comfortably racist. There’s also this weird strain of liberal racism where people believe they’re so liberal that they couldn’t possibly be racist – at another festival I had a woman describe me as “a little bit namaste”. Edinburgh changed my life and I owe my career to it so I really want to give more people from backgrounds like mine the sense that this is something they can do too. Nish Kumar, comedianI’ve heard other BAME acts talk about how their friends don’t even come up to Edinburgh because of the associated costs. The fringe is definitely skewed towards wealthier people who might not be from a BAME background, and so you’re fighting an uphill battle if you’re doing something for a more varied audience. Personally I haven’t experienced any racism at the fringe, but I still think what Fringe of Colour is doing is fantastic – if only there was a way they could eliminate the transport and hotel costs since they’re likely the biggest inhibitor stopping young BAME people from going up to the fringe. Arnab ChandaOur poetry collective, 4 BROWN GIRLS WHO WRITE, did a five-day run at the fringe with three sell-out shows. We felt that it was important to create a space for performers of colour. Both our white and non-white audience members felt empowered by the stories and voices on our stage and we even had one white member of the audience tell us that the show had helped her reflect on her privilege. We received a great response from our audiences who said there weren’t any shows like ours. We were there to creatively challenge the audience through our collective vulnerability of what it’s like to be “othered” – and people were welcoming of the space we created. 4 Brown Girls Who Write, performers and poets, LondonI love the fringe and want to keep going every year, but sometimes the subtle ignorance can get tiring. As a hijab-wearing Muslim, people handing out flyers for shows don’t approach me but instead give flyers to my white, non-hijab wearing friends. At comedy shows I’ve gotten used to comedians never trying to begin a conversation with me, no matter how many times I sit in the front row, and at bars I find people staring at me before quickly looking away. These things may be small but they all add up to make it clear that the fringe is not meant for people who look like me. Faaiza, 33, LondonI have a love-hate relationship with the fringe. Having worked on it 14 years out of the past 29, I love that the best emerging acts come to Edinburgh in August and I get the artistic nourishment that isn’t there the rest of the year. However, as an Indian woman and a creative, I hate how invisible BAME work and artists are made, through lack of access to high-profile showcases, press coverage and reviews. It can be a breeze for some BAME people but for most of us it’s not about our art, it’s about physical and mental stamina. To succeed you have to be a fighter. Annie George, performer, EdinburghI’ve been attending the fringe for almost 13 years and have never felt out of place as an ethnic minority. Perhaps more widening access schemes and better space and accommodation would help ease this problem. I think it would be more effective to reduce prices of concession tickets overall and have cheaper tickets for Edinburgh locals. It’s expensive to put on a show and this is off-putting for poorer people generally. Anonymous, EdinburghAs brilliant as the fringe is, I did look around when I was there and think: “why is this not more erse?” And I didn’t have an answer to that. With more ersity you get more interesting stories, which is especially important for art forms like theatre. There’s nothing wrong with admitting that a lack of ersity is a problem for the fringe. I do believe that to fix that there has to be a top-down movement with people who organise it making an effort to be more inclusive.

We drop in on Jon Richardson, Rose Matafeo and Josie Long, among others, to see how they liveIt is the world’s biggest comedy festival, with jokes cracked all day long in pubs, lecture rooms, basements, attics and cupboards across the city. Comedians come for exposure, to hone their craft or, simply, for a laugh. They will almost certainly lose money and are gambling on their gags, so many bunk together to save cash. I went to five houseshares to find out how comedians survive – and maybe even enjoy – performing amid the intense pressure and competition of the Edinburgh fringe.“My room’s haunted,” says Rose Matafeo. “A big shaft of light came through my curtains.” Her flatmates roar with laughter. “It’s the sun,” shouts Alice Snedden. “It was at night,” insists Matafeo. “It looked like a question mark.”This vision will strike a chord with any comic lying in bed – or couch surfing – who is asking themselves: “What am I doing here?” For Matafeo and her fellow New Zealander flatmates, the answer is: a solo show each and late-night improv together.Matafeo won the Edinburgh comedy award with her show Horndog last summer and is now back in Scotland for a short run. She is also directing Snedden’s show. While Chris Parker, Eli Matthewson and Guy Montgomery join them for the improv Snort when I went along, they were portraying pasta cops called Al Dente and Al Fresco.The five have performed together for years and regularly flatshare at festivals. A solo show can feel, says Matafeo, like Groundhog Day, as you perform the same set over again. Snedden even has the same venue – and time slot – as last year: “I’m going crazy.” “People go crazy at the fringe,” Matafeo agrees. “It’s nice to have a bubble to escape that.” Upon arriving, she buys extra pillows, candles and “just so much yarn”.Before their joint late-night gig, the Snort gang discuss their solo shows, but focus on who had a blinder, not who bombed. “We let their positivity spread across the group,” says Montgomery. Afterwards, they unwind in their New Town flat by watching Friends or a new favourite, the evil gameshow Golden Balls.In the mornings, Parker wakes them up for the “coffee train” – toot-tooting as he leaves for the daily hot beverage trip. Sneddon and Matafeo do a lot of cooking. Roasting chicken is how Snedden deals with anxiety, says Matafeo. In true flatshare style, the best rooms were nabbed first. “I arrived a day late and got the smallest bed,” Matthewson complains. “And I’m the only one with a partner visiting!” The others are nonplussed. “You two will be craving physical intimacy,” says Montgomery. But the only real downside to their digs is that the wifi is child-locked. Anyone seeking porn will have to go old school, they say, as they briefly consider reading erotic fiction to each other. Across town, I meet gag merchant Masai Graham, a winner of the UK Pun Championships and Best Joke of the Fringe. He’s losing his voice, because he does six daytime gigs then, after a power nap, stays out partying. He leans towards Ronseal titles, such as 101 Clean Jokes in 30 Minutes, a set followed by 101 Naughty jokes.Graham works full-time with autistic children and the fringe is his hobby and holiday. He haemorrhaged money the first year, but became so popular at one venue they paid his rent. Last year, he took home £8,000.Graham is staying with his mate from the West Midlands, Darren Harriott, a professional comic and best newcomer nominee in 2017. His show, Good Heart Yute, tours in the autumn and Harriott has decided to write a new joke for it every day. Standups stress too much about shows being perfect for the start of the festival, he thinks. “It should be ready by the end.”The pressure comes from knowing that among the punters are industry insiders who could send their careers rocketing. Harriott and Graham’s housemate Eshaan Akbar has already been booked for a panel show. T Jay Handley, the fourth person in the flat says some comics “think the only way to have a good time is to win an award or get five-star reviews”.During the day, Handley clears his head at a bouldering centre. Akbar watches other shows. In their kitchen, they will help each other with jokes that aren’t working, but when one of them is dying on stage, that’s is a sight to be relished: “The funniest thing,” says Graham.Lucy Beaumont first went to Edinburgh as an actor in a French play about abortion. It had one audience member all week – and he only came in to eat his sandwiches.Returning as a comedian, she stayed with some “creepy” people. “I rang my mum and said: ‘If you don’t hear from me again, you need to know they’ve done it. There’ll be no trace of me.’”This year, she is sharing a beautifully airy flat with her husband, the comedian Jon Richardson, and their chatty two-year-old daughterwho, while we have a cup of tea, is playing with her Sylvanian Families toys. It is a cheery scene. “You join us three days in,” says Richardson, pointing around the room. “This will be in pieces. We’ll all be in pieces!”Their day revolves around Beaumont’s warmly witty show, Space Mam, which is directed by Johnny Vegas. “It’s about being a mum … and aliens,” Beaumont explains. Her showIt starts at 4.45pm so she can “get home for bathtime”. How much do the couple discuss their material at home? “I’ll keep it quiet until I’m finished,” says Richardson, turning to Beaumont. “You discuss it a lot earlier on, don’t you?” He will tell Beaumont any jokes he is making about her and scrap those she doesn’t like. She admits he had a gag that she “sort of claimed”. “You stole it, to be fair,” he retorts. Beaumont smiles sweetly: “I did it funnier than you, so felt I deserved it.” Beaumont and Richardson have recently filmed a sitcom – partly improvised – based on their home life. “There’s a lot of arguing,” says Richardson.A TV regular, Richardson hasn’t done an Edinburgh run for years, he says, because he doesn’t want to take tickets away from other comics. “I would rather people saw someone new than me doing a show I’ve already done on tour.” This year, he is in a one-night charity gala. Richardson and Beaumont take turns to have nights out to see gigs.If you do a bad gig in Edinburgh, says Richardson, you walk home past posters for hundreds of comics and imagine they have all triumphed. Beaumont says she used to get jealous of other comics – especially those “from really affluent backgrounds. I always felt they seemed more relaxed.” The city’s ever-increasing rents can price out working-class comics, she says, remembering accruing debts when she performed here. But, she thinks, while the festival is so enormous now it can hardly be called a fringe, if your show is good enough, word will get around.Adding to the pressure of Edinburgh, audiences are often full of fellow comics. “A lot of older comedians come and watch you,” says Alexander Fox. One night, he was amazed to find Jack Dee in the crowd. An endorsement from Dee is included in the blurb for his show, Snare. Fox and his girlfriend, the comedian Sally Hodgkiss, are sharing a basement flat by the Meadows. Their days sound frantic, beginning with flyering for Shaken Not Stirred, an improvised James Bond film, which they perform at noon. Then Hodgkiss does Bumper Blyton, a parody promising “lashings of puns”, which finishes just as Fox starts Snare – billed as Whiplash meets The Graduate and performed partly behind a drumkit.At 7pm, Hodgkiss has been doing Whose Line Is it Anyway? Later, Fox plays the bongos for 90 seconds in Max \u0026amp Ivan’s comedy show. Then he flyers for Snare, diligently picking up those that are immediately discarded. “It’s incredibly galling,” he admits. “But cost-saving!” adds Hodgkiss. After an improvised murder mystery, they are done by midnight. They haven’t had chance to cook dinner yet, and grabbing meals between shows is expensive. But Hodgkiss’s Whose Line? gig provided “a big chunk of the rent”. Fox is performing in an inflatable igloo of a venue. It deflates over the course of the fringe, he observes, in line with everyone’s energy levels.Why do Edinburgh this year? Long echoes something Beaumont said about returning to comedy as a mother. “I’m trying to reclaim that part of myself and see if there’s still a place for me in the comedy industry.” Donahoe’s work-in-progress is about his own upbringing and having a baby.Both he and Long are doing soul-baring material during their most fraught month of work and on very little sleep. Bbut they radiate joy. Last night, Long had a loud heckler. “It derailed my show a bit but I wasn’t the slightest bit upset,” she says. After all: “I’ve given birth! Who cares?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/303a54f14a3298cd9f0cd21d581a44ced449cdc6/198_127_1862_1117/master/1862.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b87cc3dcfe487c7f78ac4756889ccd09","title":"edinburgh festival 2019 the 10 best jokes","story":"From Chic’s ‘free cow’ to the perils of free-range chicken ... the funniest gags so far from this year’s standupsSteff Todd: My new boyfriend told me he’s got my face as his wallpaper, which I thought was cute until I saw his lounge.Steff Todd: Reality Check is at Just the Tonic at the CavesOlaf Falafel: Actors who can cure my lisp?

That doesn’t apply, however, when you are talking to a man who has written a standup show about his penis – or, rather, the piece of it that was stolen from him as a baby. Tom Rosenthal, the 31-year-old star of the sitcoms Friday Night Dinner (about the embarrassments of a Jewish family) and Plebs (anachronisms and dick jokes in ancient Rome), meets me at his agent’s office and cuts to the chase. “Ever since I became aware of what had happened to me, I’ve never felt so sure that something is wrong.” The earnest tone signals that any jokes on the subject will be confined to the stage. “I just don’t think it’s very funny.”Fortunately, the show is. Manhood traces Rosenthal’s gradual realisation that he didn’t want to belong to a club that would have a member like his as a member. First, there was the “little sleeve” he noticed on a classmate’s penis. Then came the terrifying circumcision video shown at his school when he was 12, which led to a confrontation at home. “I had a shouting match with my mother. She took me to a doctor who basically invalidated all my feelings. The truth is that my parents were put in charge of my welfare and they did something to me that can never be remedied.”This is all some way from Richard Herring’s hit show Talking Cock, which scrutinised attitudes towards male genitalia but kept the knob gags coming. Although Rosenthal’s set is hilarious, it is also candid, angry and often painful. An earlier version was “a bit too much like a Ted Talk”, with the balance tipped in favour of some formidable and wide-ranging research. Only once he started emphasising that he had skin in the game, so to speak, as well as interrogating the justifications for circumcision, did he locate the show’s real power.Nothing is off limits in Manhood, whether it is the adverse effect circumcision has had on Rosenthal’s sexual performance or its relationship to his OCD. The details extend even to a discussion of his father’s genitalia. Yes, that is the penis of Jim Rosenthal, the sports presenter named by the creators of Alan Partridge as an inspiration for their gauche and gaffe-prone Norfolk-based broadcaster. Rosenthal Jr has already mined that area in his 2011 fringe debut, Child of Privilege, where he discussed his father’s failed attempt to sue Heston Blumenthal over a food poisoning incident.“My dad liked the idea that I was taking the piss out of him,” he says. “Of course, discussing his penis is slightly more intimate.” One of the reasons Rosenthal was given for his own circumcision was that “a boy’s penis should look like his father’s”. I had assumed Rosenthal Sr was circumcised for religious reasons, but his son, who has got a lot of comic mileage out of being mistaken for a Jew, sets me straight. “The last proper Jew in our family was four generations back. My dad was circumcised for medical reasons, which is another bloody rabbit hole because a lot of those cases are misdiagnosed.”What is his father’s attitude to the subject now? “He’s very funny. And not in the way I’d like him to be. He’ll say: ‘Doesn’t sex feel good? My penis is fine!’ He cares about the fact that I care. But he doesn’t care for the reasons that I care about it.” Rosenthal’s parents will see the show in Edinburgh. “Dad said initially that he wouldn’t. He thought it was a revenge show, a ‘fuck you’, and it isn’t that at all.”When I ask whether he can forgive his parents, he spits out a mirthless “Ha!” then furrows his brow. “That’s a really hard question. I think they asked me this. I’d forgive them everything. I’m thankful they’ve been so open to me.” He is aware that as a white, middle-class, heterosexual man, he doesn’t have a lot to complain about. The fact that his circumcision is the defining horror of his life is, he points out, “an indication of how nice the rest of it has been. But it’s one of the fundamental sadnesses of the whole thing, and one I hope to get past, that whenever you have sexual interactions, it’s on your mind. Which obviously isn’t optimum.” It even affects his choice of porn: “I prefer to watch uncircumcised penises because I like to see how they work.”The last thing he wants, though, is to make men who are contented with their own equipment feel damaged or defensive. “The aim is to recognise that if this has happened to you and you feel fine about it, that’s great. But if you don’t feel fine, which I don’t, then you’re justified.” It would be nice also if the audience laughs. “Yeah!

It covers more than 200 hectares (494 acres) of heathland, grassland and woodland. Three trails run through the scenery, each a manageable 112 miles, and kids can pick up a wildlife-challenge checklist from the information point at the start, then exchange it for a certificate at the end. The woodpecker and nuthatch trails loop past a hide where it’s possible to watch birds feeding and the buzzard trail passes through an area that was once an iron-age hill fort. We walked this route, and the change in the landscape was incredible: from flat, open heathland cloaked in purple heather, to deep, thick woodland so gloriously overgrown that my children thought we were on a jungle expedition.If following the woodpecker trail, listen out for the cackle of the green woodpecker laughing at you. Unlike Woody Woodpecker, these birds don’t do the tree-drumming thing as their bills are too weak, so you’ll hear their laugh-like call – known as a yaffle – instead. And look down, not up, if you want the best chance of spotting one. They mostly eat ants, found on the forest floor.The wild play area was the highlight for my school-age kids. It’s a natural playground with musical instruments made from tree stumps, climbing frames made from tree trunks and loads of wood to build dens with. It’s next to the car park, so it’s the first thing you come to, but even on a sunny day in the summer holidays it was quiet enough that all the children could play in peace. The RSPB volunteers deserve a special mention, too. From the guides at the information point, to the wildlife experts who helped us spot hobby chicks in their nest through telescopes, everyone was keen to share their wildlife knowledge with us.There are picnic benches in front of the visitor centre and shop (the Gatehouse) and loads of space to pitch up with a picnic blanket in the reserve itself. The shop sells pre-packed sandwiches and rolls (£2.50), hot drinks from a machine (tea £1.70, coffee £2), cold drinks and ice-creams. There’s no seating inside, so it’s a fair-weather affair or an emergency in-car lunch if it rains. We packed a picnic and bought some drinks (£1.99), then spent half an hour defending them from wasps.The little shop in the Gatehouse is quite sweet, with its wildlife books, animal soft toys and bird feeders (for the garden). Binoculars can be bought here, or hired for the day (£5). At the information centre, you can sign up to become an RSPB member and buy little pin-badges for a £1 donation.East Midlands Trains operates services from St Pancras station to Sandy – the journey takes 50 minutes, and from the station, it’s a 10-minute walk to the start of the nature trails. If driving, it’s just off the A1 – take the B1042 Potton road from Sandy town centre.Parking is £6 for the day – or free for members – although it’s worth getting there early as the car park gets busy in the holidays. Access to the reserve is free, so it makes for an affordable day out if you bring a picnic.Car park and reserve open 7am-8pm, or dusk if it’s earlier, all year round apart from Christmas Day and Boxing Day. Shop open 9am-5pm weekdays, 10am-5pm weekends and bank holidays.810. Although my two reluctant walkers moaned initially, they loved doing the wildlife challenge and running free in the wild play area, and us grownups loved having a decent day out for less than a tenner.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

We are with you, he vowed, saying it was in the US national security interest to see a successful Brexit, with or without a deal with the EU by 31 October. Laced with a few barbs at the expense of Brussels, he presented his credentials as a pioneer Brexiteer, arguing he was a leaver before there were leavers.But Bolton did not just vow friendship or repeat the oft-made promise that the UK will be at the front of the queue for any trade deal, he came with a specific proposal.Britain and the US could strike interim deals lowering trade barriers in specific areas, such as manufacturing and automotives, before a comprehensive trade deal could be signed some years down the line, he said. He was sure such deals could be greeted with unanimous bipartisan support by Congress, the body that sanctions US trade agreements. The aim is to provide the UK with a compensatory safety net as it loses access to European markets in a no-deal scenario. It is not quite a bail out, but it underlines how much the Trump administration sees Britain’s exit from the European Union as being in the US’s national security interest.Boltonians have always seen the EU as not just a bureaucratic behemoth, or potential rival to US power, but an affront to how it believes the world should be ordered. The traditional US argument that Britain inside the EU can act as an influential advocate for Washington’s interests has been jettisoned in the Trump era.Multilateral power blocs need to be neutered, and as Trump argued in his speech to the UN in 2018 the “doctrine of patriotism” must hold sway. “Around the world, responsible nations must defend against threats to sovereignty not just from global governance, but also from other, new forms of coercion and domination,” he told the general assembly. America, he said, will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance.It is quite clear that if Bolton had his way, Brexit would not just liberate Britain, but lead to a wider break-up of the EU. It was notable that the only Conservatives he planned to meet outside government on his visit were leading figures in the European Research group such as Bernard Jenkin, Iain Duncan Smith and Bill Cash, not exactly a representative cross section of the Tory benches.In championing US support for Brexit, Bolton brushed aside many of the problems of a no deal exit or US-UK trade deal. No deal represented no risk to the Good Friday Agreement, he asserted. He said he had asked for the threat a US trade deal could pose to the NHS to be explained to him and he had not understood the argument, so he would not comment. Concern about chlorinated chicken being sold to UK consumers was treated largely as a joke. The other side of an argument is not somewhere Bolton often frequents.But the bigger picture is the extent to which the UK outside the EU will feel required to come under Washington’s sway. Bolton said he respected the UK’s short-term need to focus on Brexit in the weeks ahead, but he laid down markers on the two issues that most concern the US: the role of the Chinese technology company Huawei in the UK’s 5G network and the future of the Iran nuclear deal.On the former he claimed the UK had agreed to reconsider from first principles, an analysis not shared by UK officials. On Iran, Bolton was content to bide his time, possibly believing the deal will collapse anyway, but took note that the Johnson team had already ditched plans for a separate European maritime security operation in the Gulf, and would instead come under the umbrella of the US-led Operation Sentinel.But for the Foreign Office to abandon the nuclear deal now would represent such a complete about-face, one imagines senior diplomats would resign. The 2015 deal, brokered by the EU and Obama administration, is seen as one of the great diplomatic achievements of this century, and for Britain to join in Trump’s wilful destruction of it would be seen as an act of obeisance to Washington. It would also infuriate Berlin and Paris, who still think the deal can be rescued.That does not mean the deal will survive. The relentless economic pressure from the US is forcing Tehran to take steps that the UK cannot defend. The upcoming G7 summit in Biarritz is where some of these issues will likely be played out. It may also be where Johnson finds out the true extent to which Washington wants to pull London away not only from the European Union, but from European values."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/309fff93d4d3ef87974fbb0928d9d60a3dc2139d/0_174_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60e922dc773376ce6732c228256c20d4","title":"fbi raids jeffrey epsteins private caribbean island","story":"Expert says financier’s death may reduce legal issues with evidence as search beginsThe FBI has raided Jeffrey Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean, in a further sign the death of the financier will not halt scrutiny  of his alleged sex trafficking crimes.Mobile phone footage broadcast by NBC news showed agents arriving on Little Saint James, in the US Virgin Islands, on Monday morning.Two senior law enforcement officials confirmed to NBC the FBI had begun a search directed by the Epstein taskforce, which is led by the US attorney’s office for the southern district of New York.Kelly Quinn, who was running a sailing charter in the area, told NBC: “We were just trying to look at pretty fish and swim with turtles and here we are in the middle of an FBI raid. This has been something on our radar for years. We’re all really curious why it’s happening now.”The raid came two days after the billionaire was found dead in a New York City jail cell, having apparently killed himself. In the aftermath of his death, accusers expressed anger that Epstein would not face them in court. They sought reassurances that authorities would continue investigations into others who might have been involved in a trafficking ring that targeted young girls for sexual abuse.William Barr, the US attorney general, said on Monday that “any co-conspirators should not rest easy. Victims deserve justice and will get it”.Geoffrey S Berman, the Manhattan attorney, said in a statement: “To those brave young women who have already come forward and to the many others who have yet to do so, let me reiterate that we remain committed to standing for you, and our investigation of the conduct charged in the indictment – which included a conspiracy count – remains ongoing.”David Weinstein, a white collar criminal defence lawyer with Hinshaw \u0026amp Culbertson and former federal prosecutor in Miami, previously told the  Epstein’s death could reduce potential issues with evidence. This could explain the timing of the raid.Berman’s case against Epstein for alleged sexual abuse of girls as young as 14 includes charges of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. The indictment alleges Epstein “worked and conspired with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his conduct” in luring girls to his Manhattan and Palm Beach homes between 2002 and 2005.Epstein was also described as “at ease” when discussing his interest in young women.“He said that criminalising sex with teenage girls was a cultural aberration and that at times in history it was perfectly acceptable,” Stewart said. “He pointed out that homosexuality had long been considered a crime and was still punishable by death in some parts of the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb5c79f45cb96d58006dead966a1b93df6645265/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b24ff6ed8c4d5aa0509508c8322b33c4","title":"hungary far right government finland rule law inquiry","story":"PM Viktor Orbán and his spokesman launch series of attacks on Finnish presidency Finland has pledged to pursue a hearing into alleged breaches of the rule of law by Hungary’s far-right government after a campaign of vilification led by the prime minister, Viktor Orbán.Orbán and his spokesman, Zoltán Kovács, have launched a series of attacks in recent weeks ranging from criticism of the level of domestic violence in Finland to the purchase of strategically important Finnish islands by Russian oligarchs.As the member state holding the EU’s rolling presidency until the new year, the Finnish government is responsible for chairing meetings of the member states and pushing forward the bloc’s agenda.The European parliament took the unprecedented step last September of asking member states to determine whether Hungary had breached the bloc’s founding values in its overhaul of the country’s judiciary and alleged failure to respect freedom of expression, religion and equal treatment under the law.In the most recent broadside, Kovács, who is Hungary’s secretary of state for international communication and relations, wrote that Finland “doesn’t have a constitutional court, independent judiciary or press freedom, it also shows signs of other serious problems as well”.He raised the “petrifying” numbers of women undergoing female genital mutilation and the “grave threat” facing “freshly settled religious minorities”.The Economist’s annual democracy index ranks Finland as having among the most democratic systems in the world.When its government assumed the presidency on 1 July it said it would respect the parliament’s vote in favour of pursuing the so-called article 7 process, under which Hungary could theoretically face the “nuclear” sanction of having its voting rights in EU institutions suspended.On the eve of the vote, Orbán had told MEPs that his country was being targeted for choosing not to be “a country of migrants” and dismissed charges of corruption.His spokesman’s article last month was in part a response to a defence of Finland’s duty to pursue the issue by Petri Tuomi-Nikula, a former Finnish ambassador to Hungary, who had written that the country was “one of the most corrupt … in the union”.A spokesman for the Finnish government said the latest developments would not prevent it from “taking forward the ongoing procedures concerning the rule of law as appropriate”.The spokesman said: “The article 7 procedure has been triggered, in the case of Hungary, by the European parliament. The treaty indicates that the next step will be a hearing in the council of the country concerned.“The Finnish presidency believes Hungary has the right to be heard and that it is also in its best interest.”The spokesman said the parliament had voted “nearly a year ago, so we think it is high time to move to the hearings. For some time already, a large number of member states have been demanding that hearings should begin.“The article 7 procedure should not be seen as a process directed against a particular member state. The rule of law is part of our shared value basis and something that unites us all. We believe we must cherish it. The Finnish presidency intends to promote rule of law issues through a positive and constructive approach.”Fabian Zuleeg, from the European Policy Centre, a Brussels thinktank said the stakes for Orbán over the rule of law would be greater if France successfully argued that EU funding should be linked to respect for the bloc’s treaties.“A greater focus on rule of law was always going to produce a counter reaction by Hungary, which under Orbán has always argued that its democracy is as good as anywhere else in Europe, and that any comments or actions reflect different political ideologies,” he said.“But the real political fight is still to come when the EU gets into the final phase of agreeing the next multi-annual financial framework. Here, a lot is at stake for Orbán if funding is made conditional on rule of law, which a number of western countries want to push for.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebf07be19e1ae5ca96b03ef281737bc7d7c99885/0_33_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d140bc80bbea352e8580246403589ea","title":"mps call for tougher penalties on drivers using mobile phones","story":"Transport select committee calls for tougher penalties on drivers using mobile phonesTougher restrictions on drivers using mobile phones, including extending the ban to hands-free devices, should be considered, MPs have said.The transport select committee said using any type of mobile phone while driving had potentially catastrophic consequences. The MPs called for more severe penalties “commensurate with the risks”, as road deaths linked to phone use have risen steadily over the past decade.In 2017, there were 773 casualties on Britain’s roads, including 43 deaths and 135 serious injuries, in crashes in which the driver was using a mobile phone.But rates of enforcement had dropped by more than two-thirds since 2011, the committee said, as it called on the government to work with police to make better use of technology and deter offenders.Although penalties for using a handheld mobile phone while driving were doubled in 2017 – to six points on a licence and a £200 fine – the committee said they should be reviewed and potentially increased.Given evidence that phone use diminished driving ability as much as drink-driving, the committee said the government should explore whether to extend the ban to hands-free calls. Although it acknowledged there would be practical challenges, it recommended that the government launch a public consultation on criminalising the use of hands-free devices by drivers.The committee chair, Lilian Greenwood MP, said far too many drivers continued to break the law by using handheld mobile phones, despite the risks. She said: “If mobile phone use while driving is to become as socially unacceptable as drink-driving, much more effort needs to go into educating drivers about the risks and consequences of using a phone behind the wheel.“Offenders also need to know there is a credible risk of being caught, and that there are serious consequences for being caught.”She added: “There is also a misleading impression that hands-free use is safe. The reality is that any use of a phone distracts from a driver’s ability to pay full attention, and the government should consider extending the ban to reflect this.”Motoring organisations the RAC and the AA backed calls for a review and said enforcement was a crucial factor. Edmund King, the AA president, said: “Offenders think the chance of being caught is minimal. Following a reduction of specialist traffic officers by a third, a good deterrent would be to have more cops in cars targeting those tempted to pick up the phone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e5d6917fc1e6aeefd46bc6c7db22c8f88397775/0_313_4695_2817/master/4695.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee7f9fa154925b2b0df1489fb9e9f3a1","title":"small is beautiful in tokyo golden gai in pictures","story":"Nearly 300 bars and restaurants are squeezed into an area about the size of half a football pitch in the Golden Gai area of Tokyo.

Photograph: Jason SzenesEPAWho was Jeffrey Epstein?Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in his prison cell on Saturday morning, was a 66-year-old finance executive. His glittering array of contacts and immense wealth made him one of the most recognisable faces on the US social circuit through the 1980s and 1990s.In 2007, however, he was convicted by a Florida court of soliciting prostitution following allegations that he paid a 14-year-old girl for sexual favours.Epstein ultimately avoided federal prosecution and pleaded guilty to lesser state charges. He was sentenced to 13 months in prison, but spent most of the time on day release. On July 6th this year, Epstein was arrested by police as he landed in the United States on his private plane from Paris. Federal prosecutors accused him of recruiting young women and girls between 2002 and 2005 to perform sex acts on him at his homes in New York and Florida.The fresh arrests renewed focus on the original Florida conviction and the perceived leniency of the sentence. Alexander Acosta, Donald Trump’s secretary of labour, was forced to resign last month over his involvement in the original case, which took place when he was US attorney for the southern district of Florida.\u0026nbspWhy is he of interest?\u0026nbspEpstein had strong political and social connections, including with current and former presidents. Since his arrest last month, footage has emerged of Donald Trump and Epstein partying with groups of women at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in the 1990s. Another photo shows Trump and his future wife Melania alongside Epstein. Trump described Epstein as a “terrific guy” in a 2002 interview, adding: “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”But Trump has distanced himself from the financier more recently, telling reporters last month that he had fallen out with Epstein some years ago, in what is believed to have been a property dispute.Former president Bill Clinton was another acquaintance. Clinton travelled on Epstein’s private plane while Epstein donated money to the Clinton Foundation.Other contacts included Britain’s Prince Andrew, who was named in court documents unsealed last Friday related to a case taken by Virginia Roberts Giuffre. Giuffre, who says she was recruited by Epstein while working at Mar-a-Lago, also names former Northern Ireland special envoy George Mitchell in the deposition. Mitchell has strenuously denied the allegations.Does Epstein’s death mean the end of the investigation?Epstein’s alleged victims have expressed dismay that he will not face justice. However, the US attorney for the southern district of New York said that the investigation “remains ongoing”. Speaking on Saturday, Geoffrey S Berman noted that the indictment included one count of conspiracy, prompting speculation that the investigation will shift to his associates.This was echoed by attorney general William Barr on Monday, who warned that the case will continue against “anyone who was complicit with Epstein”.Among possible persons of interest is Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of British publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell, and a close companion of Epstein’s before his Florida conviction.Focus has also turned to his relationship with Leslie Wexner, owner of the company which owns lingerie business Victoria’s Secret. Epstein ran Wexner’s financial affairs for years, and investigators are said to be examining Epstein’s own finances to examine how he secured a vast fortune that allowed him buy islands, a private jet and exclusive properties.In addition to the criminal investigation, inidual victims may pursue civil cases, with lawyers for victims suggesting this week they will sue his estate. A document filed by Epstein’s lawyers last month estimated his assets at about $559 million, including two private islands and four homes.Three separate investigations have been opened into his death – the FBI, the US justice department and the New York City medical examiner’s office have all initiated probes.In particular, investigators are said to be examining whether Epstein was being monitored every 30 minutes by guards, and why he was left alone in his cell, given that he is suspected of having attempted suicide three weeks earlier."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3984815.1565685410!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the day jeffrey epstein told me he had dirt on powerful people","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Manhattan home of Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in his prison cell on the morning of Saturday, August 10th. Photograph: Kirsten LuceThe New York TimesAlmost exactly a year ago, on August 16th, 2018, I visited Jeffrey Epstein at his cavernous Manhattan mansion. The overriding impression I took away from our roughly 90-minute conversation was that Epstein knew an astonishing number of rich, famous and powerful people, and had photos to prove it. He also claimed to know a great deal about these people, some of it potentially damaging or embarrassing, including details about their supposed sexual proclivities and recreational drug use.So one of my first thoughts on hearing of Epstein’s suicide was that many prominent men and at least a few women must be breathing sighs of relief that whatever Epstein knew, he has taken it with him.During our conversation, Epstein made no secret of his own scandalous past – he’d pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting prostitution from underage girls and was a registered sex offender – and acknowledged to me that he was a pariah in polite society. At the same time, he seemed unapologetic. His very notoriety, he said, was what made so many people willing to confide in him. Everyone, he suggested, has secrets and, he added, compared with his own, they seemed innocuous. People confided in him without feeling awkward or embarrassed, he claimed.I’d never met Epstein before. I had contacted him because my colleagues and I had heard a rumour that he was advising Tesla’s embattled chief executive, Elon Musk, who was in trouble after announcing on Twitter that he had lined up the funding to take Tesla private.The Securities and Exchange Commission began an investigation into Musk’s remarks, which moved markets but didn’t appear to have much basis in fact. There were calls for Musk to relinquish his position as Tesla’s chairman and for Tesla to recruit more independent directors. I’d heard that Epstein was compiling a list of candidates at Musk’s behest – and that Epstein had an email from Musk authorising the search for a new chairman. Musk and Tesla vehemently deny this.When I contacted Epstein, he readily agreed to an interview. The caveat was that the conversation would be “on background”, which meant I could use the information as long as I didn’t attribute it directly to him. (I consider that condition to have lapsed with his death.)He insisted that I meet him at his house, which I’d seen referred to as the largest single-family home in Manhattan. This seems plausible: I initially walked past the building, on East 71st Street, because it looked more like an embassy or museum than a private home. Next to the imposing double doors was a polished brass plaque with the initials “J.E.” and a bell. After I rang, the door was opened by a young woman, her blonde hair pulled back in a chignon, who greeted me with what sounded like an eastern European accent.I can’t say how old she was, but my guess would be late teens or perhaps 20. Given Epstein’s past, this struck me as far too close to the line. Why would Epstein want a reporter’s first impression to be that of a young woman opening his door?Yoga practiceThe woman led me up a monumental staircase to a room on the second floor overlooking the Frick museum across the street. It was quiet, the lighting dim, and the air-conditioning was set very low. After a few minutes, Epstein bounded in, dressed casually in jeans and a polo shirt, shook my hand and said he was a big fan of my work. He had a big smile and warm manner. He was trim and energetic, perhaps from all the yoga he said he was practising. He was undeniably charismatic.Before we left the room he took me to a wall covered with framed photographs. He pointed to a full-length shot of a man in traditional Arab dress. “That’s MBS,” he said, referring to Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. The crown prince had visited him many times, and they spoke often, Epstein said.He led me to a large room at the rear of the house. There was an expansive table with about 20 chairs. Epstein took a seat at the head, and I sat to his left. He had a computer, a small blackboard and a phone to his right. He said he was doing some foreign-currency trading.Behind him was a table covered with more photographs. I noticed one of Epstein with former President Bill Clinton, and another of him with the director Woody Allen. Displaying photos of celebrities who had been caught up in sex scandals of their own also struck me as odd.Epstein avoided specifics about his work for Tesla. He told me that he had good reason to be cryptic: Once it became public that he was advising the company, he’d have to stop doing so, because he was “radioactive”. He predicted that everyone at Tesla would deny talking to him or being his friend.He said this was something he’d become used to, even though it didn’t stop people from visiting him, coming to his dinner parties or asking him for money. (That was why, Epstein told me without any trace of irony, he was considering becoming a minister so that his acquaintances would be confident that their conversations would be kept confidential.)If he was reticent about Tesla, he was more at ease discussing his interest in young women. He said that criminalising sex with teenage girls was a cultural aberration and that at times in history it was perfectly acceptable. He pointed out that homosexuality had long been considered a crime and was still punishable by death in some parts of the world.Geeky workaholicsEpstein then meandered into a discussion of other prominent names in technology circles. He said people in Silicon Valley had a reputation for being geeky workaholics, but that was far from the truth: They were hedonistic and regular users of recreational drugs. He said he’d witnessed prominent tech figures taking drugs and arranging for sex (Epstein stressed that he never drank or used drugs of any kind).I kept trying to steer the conversation back to Tesla, but Epstein remained evasive. He said he’d spoken to the Saudis about possibly investing in Tesla, but he wouldn’t provide any specifics or names. When I pressed him on the purported email from Musk, he said the email wasn’t from Musk himself, but from someone very close to him. He wouldn’t say who that person was. I asked him if that person would talk to me, and he said he’d ask. He later said the person declined I doubt he asked.When I later reflected on our interview, I was struck at how little information Epstein had actually provided. While I can’t say anything he said was an explicit lie, much of what he said was vague or speculative and couldn’t be proved or disproved. He did have at least some ties to Musk – a widely circulated photo shows Musk with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s confidante and former companion, at the 2014 Vanity Fair Oscars party. But it seemed clear Epstein had embellished his role in the Tesla situation to enhance his own importance and gain attention – something that now seems to have been a pattern.About a week after that interview, Epstein called and asked if I’d like to have dinner that Saturday with him and Woody Allen. I said I’d be out of town. A few weeks after that, he asked me to join him for dinner with author Michael Wolff and Donald Trump’s former adviser, Steve Bannon. I declined. (I don’t know if these dinners actually happened. Bannon has said he didn’t attend. Wolff and a spokeswoman for Allen didn’t respond to requests for comment Monday.)Several months passed. Then early this year Epstein called to ask if I’d be interested in writing his biography. He sounded almost plaintive. I sensed that what he really wanted was companionship. As his biographer, I’d have no choice but to spend hours listening to his saga. Already leery of any further ties to him, I was relieved I could say that I was already busy with another book.That was the last I heard from him.

When other teams come to us, they pile their plates high. And when they eat the food, nobody complains.Although you usually get one middle-aged white man who is horrified.

The data suggested trading was “consistent with material illegal activity”.An FCA spokesperson responded: “The FCA has been aware of these matters since the first tweet and price movements on Tuesday of last week and at that point we began undertaking wide-ranging enquiries. We will continue to make enquiries using the wide range of data and resources at our disposal.”Burford said it detected signs of spoofing and layering – illegal methods of driving down share prices, which have resulted in convictions previously.For example, trading data showed that there was “an unusual flood” of order cancellations beginning shortly before Muddy Waters’ original tweet. Burford also said: “While Muddy Waters was suggesting that Burford was insolvent, it was at the same time buying Burford shares.”In its report, Muddy Waters labelled Burford a “poor business masquerading as a great one”. Burford’s shares plunged by 65 per cent over the course of 6 and 7 August, with almost £2bn wiped off the firm’s value.The following day, Burford hit back against the report, accusing Muddy Waters of peddling “factual inaccuracies” and “fallacious insinuations”.Christopher Bogart, chief executive of Burford, said the company’s “market-leading” business is the same as it was a week ago.He said: “What has changed is that a substantial amount of market value was wiped out by activity we believe is consistent with illegal market manipulation that has nothing to do with Burford’s business. That is wrong and that is illegal.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The data suggested trading was “consistent with material illegal activity”.An FCA spokesperson responded: “The FCA has been aware of these matters since the first tweet and price movements on Tuesday of last week and at that point we began undertaking wide-ranging enquiries. We will continue to make enquiries using the wide range of data and resources at our disposal.”Burford said it detected signs of spoofing and layering – illegal methods of driving down share prices, which have resulted in convictions previously.For example, trading data showed that there was “an unusual flood” of order cancellations beginning shortly before Muddy Waters’ original tweet. Burford also said: “While Muddy Waters was suggesting that Burford was insolvent, it was at the same time buying Burford shares.”In its report, Muddy Waters labelled Burford a “poor business masquerading as a great one”. Burford’s shares plunged by 65 per cent over the course of 6 and 7 August, with almost £2bn wiped off the firm’s value.The following day, Burford hit back against the report, accusing Muddy Waters of peddling “factual inaccuracies” and “fallacious insinuations”.Christopher Bogart, chief executive of Burford, said the company’s “market-leading” business is the same as it was a week ago.He said: “What has changed is that a substantial amount of market value was wiped out by activity we believe is consistent with illegal market manipulation that has nothing to do with Burford’s business. That is wrong and that is illegal.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We need an immediate freeze in rates, as well as fixing the transitional relief, which leads to corner shops in Redcar subsidising banks in central London.”Last month was also the worst July on record for year-on-year growth in total retail sales.Figures from the BRC-KPMG retail sales monitor published earlier this month showed sales edged up by just 0.3 per cent\u0026nbspyear on year in July, compared with an increase of 1.6 per cent\u0026nbspin July 2018.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Policymakers have looked for an explanation in the so-called supply side of the economy – the ways in which goods are made and services delivered – and pointed to declining technological innovation and cheap loans keeping unproductive “zombie” firms afloat, among other possible reasons.\u0026nbspBut the New Economics Foundation says its research shows that the government must also look at the demand side – the level and nature of spending across the country.\u0026nbsp“Average productivity, wages and living standards have experienced their worst decade in almost two centuries. It is increasingly clear that weak demand has been the overlooked problem,” said Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the think tank.\u0026nbsp“Raising demand by putting more cash in the pockets of the UK’s poorest workers, while giving people more paid time off from work to spend it, should now be part of a radical mix of options for any government that is serious about increasing productivity in a way that works for people and society.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Britain’s Jamie Chadwick wins first-ever W Series title.

Instead, companies rely on cheaper labour that can be shed quickly if demand doesn’t improve. As a result, productivity does not improve.The New Economics Foundation finds evidence of exactly this in official data.\u0026nbspIt says that since 2012, firms have increasingly preferred to hire rather than to invest and that, relative to all employees, the proportion of zero-hour and self-employed workers, as well as one-person “micro-companies”, has grown by two fifths since before the financial crisis. The corresponding lack of investment now explains at least a quarter of the UK’s gap in productivity with the historical trend.A report by the New Economics Foundation sets out a number of measures to lift demand, including gradual increases in statutory paid holiday and faster rises in the minimum wage.\u0026nbsp“The evidence shows that increased leisure time for workers can be expected to increase economy-wide demand,” the think tank says.It adds: “Increasing minimum wages is a particularly efficient way of boosting demand because workers on minimum wages are far more likely to spend rather than save any increases in salary, compared with higher-income iniduals.”Based on the same logic, the report recommends abolishing the personal allowance of income tax and using the extra public revenue on direct payouts to consumers and an increase in child benefit. It says this will redistribute £8bn a year from the richest 35 per cent of households to the remaining 65 per cent, with most of the gains concentrated on the poorest 10 per cent.\u0026nbspThe think tank also argues the government should frontload a large share of investment required to turn Britain into a zero-carbon economy over the next five years, in order to boost demand.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was how they were produced and how people used them when they got to the UK that matters. So that was a real eye-opener.”Most of this comes from\u0026nbspfertilisers,\u0026nbsppesticides and the fuel used by machinery during harvesting.They are then processed and sorted. If the orange is used to make juice, 22 per cent of the total footprint is down to transport and distribution.Professor Reay said: “If you just assume everything closer to you is better, so if you’re thinking these blueberries or cucumber from Holland in January will be low carbon, they\u0026nbspwon’t be. It’s going to be intensive production with a high carbon footprint.“This will massively outweigh the food miles of bringing them\u0026nbspfrom a country where the climate is right at that time of year.”Created with Sketch.Teenage climate change protesters threatened with arrest at Heathrow  Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Four teenage protesters, holding a banner reading “Are we the last generation”Police surround the protestersFour teenage protesters, holding a banner reading “Are we the last generation”Police surround the protestersAccording to government data, buying a tomato grown in the UK has three times the footprint of a tomato grown in Spain.Lettuces grown in the UK during winter are cultivated in poly tunnels which require\u0026nbsplots of energy to keep them warm. In terms of carbon emissions, it is more environmentally friendly to buy them from Spain during the winter and in the UK during the summer.But food miles do matter if the product has been transported by air. For this reason, Professor Reay says consumers should avoid eating out-of-season soft fruit such as raspberries and blueberries.A 100g box of blueberries\u0026nbspgrown locally or imported via ship will produce around 100g of carbon dioxide. If it’s flown in, that increases by ten times, pushing its carbon footprint up to more like 1kg.Destruction of land must stop to tackle climate change, says reportClimate change could cause toxic mercury to accumulate in seafood“If you want to go into the high carbon footprint foods then once it’s been air freighted you’re in real trouble. That’s when the food miles absolutely soar in terms of emissions. We should have a blanket ban on air freight,” said Professor\u0026nbspReay.Despite the fiendishly difficult business of counting carbon he says the message “buy local” needs to go with “in season”. \u0026nbsp“The food mile message is a little more nuanced than it’s sometimes presented,” he added.Reducing waste would also make a significant difference to the carbon footprint.According to 2017 research, food waste accounts for 8 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions. If food waste were a country it would come behind China and the US as the largest emitters on the planet.Professor Derek Stewart, an agri-food sector expert from the James Hutton Institute, said the book was interesting but some of the data could be challenged, notably on the grounds that it only looked at carbon dioxide emissions.Ships use dirty fuels that emit nitrogen and sulphur as well as carbon dioxide which has a significantly larger greenhouse gas impact than carbon dioxide alone, he said.PMQsProfessor Stewart added: “The carbon footprint is too nebulous for most people and in fact forms only part of a food supply chain.”Dr Eugene Mohareb, a lecturer in sustainable urban systems at the University of Reading, commended the overall analysis of food miles and the impacts of production.“In an ideal world, embodied carbon from production and transport would be communicated to the consumer on food products so that they could make informed decisions. But in the absence of that, eating produce in season can be a good guide,” he said.Food systems contribute to between 20 and 30 per cent of emissions globally and Dr Mohareb says the UK is unlikely to reach net zero by 2050 unless these emissions are reduced.“There are many things that we as consumers can do to reduce this impact. For example, we found that a simple measure, such as using grocery delivery instead of collecting by car just half of the time, reduced someone’s total impact on the food system by around half a percentage point,” he said.Eating vegetarian\u0026nbspone day a week could reduce someone’s overall impact by around 4 per cent.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To keep him involved, the crew had to head to where the actor was filming his other, bigger projects (hence the season begins with a double episode in London, where he was filming s of the Galaxy). That season also saw Rob Lowe and Rashida Jones leave the show, leading to some patches that were never really covered over. Still, the final episode was still a delight, with Amy Poehler’s Leslie Knope meeting Michelle Obama and getting her dream job in Pawnee. But then they made a seventh, completely unnecessary season a few years later… which we should all forget exists.The show that birthed the phrase “jumping the shark”. Season five of Happy Days saw Fonzie literally jumping over a shark – a moment so absurd that critics were left asking whether the writers had run out of material. The moment became the turning point for Happy Days as the quality gradually began to decline, the inclination of which got steeper after Ron Howard left after season seven.Thanks to stellar reviews and enticing advertising, Heroes quickly became one of the most-popular shows on television in 2006. However, while the charming first season – which centred on a group of people coming to terms with their super-human powers – was a fast-paced addictive ride, the second was a meandering mess. The first few episodes contained so much filler that viewers turned off in their droves. Season three fared no better, and by the conclusion of season four only 4.41 million people were still watching – down from the 16.97 million who watched the season two premiere.There was once a time when every winner on The X Factor was pretty much guaranteed a Christmas number one. It became such a monotonous routine in the UK that music lovers protested by getting Rage Against the Machine’s “Killing in the Name Of” to the coveted top spot in 2009. Coincidentally, the following years have seen the X Factor’s ratings begin to dwindle, mainly thanks to viewers becoming bored of the same sob stories being wheeled out every year. To fix this, Simon Cowell attempted to switch up the judges at an increased rate, scraping the barrel in 2015 by bringing on Nick Grimshaw (the same year that Dermot O’Leary stepped down as presenter, to be replaced by television’s most awkward duo, Caroline Flack and Olly Murs). Despite Louis Walsh, Nicole Scherzinger and Sharon Osbourne (and Dermot) coming back the year after, the damage had already been done.Stars often outgrow their shows. Midway through the fourth season of Community, Donald Glover, who played Troy, left to pursue a music career as the rapper Childish Gambino. Of course, that did not turn out too badly, with Glover now having a few Grammys on his mantelpiece. Unfortunately, Community was never the same without him, and the dominoes kept falling after that. Chevy Chase also left, while Dan Harmon stopped writing for the show. As a result, the final two seasons received awful reviews.Big Brother was a big deal. The first few seasons spawned celebrities and managed to attract millions of viewers. While originally a strange social experiment put on by Channel 4, the show devolved into a middling reality TV series where contestants would do anything to prolong their 15 minutes of fame. When the show moved to Channel 5, it was only another knock on the death knell.The team behind Dallas were so desperate to bring back Patrick Duffy\u0027s character Bobby Ewing that they made the entire ninth season one long dream sequence. Of course, they had initially not known the entire season would be a dream, as Duffy had voluntarily left to pursue other acting jobs. Obviously, things did not go well for the actor, and the writing team put him back into the show – at the expense of viewers, who felt understandably short-changed by the events of 31 episodes being reversed. Note for TV writers: “It was all a dream” is not a good TV trope.830 House of CardsBefore Kevin Spacey was kicked off the cast following more than 40 allegations of sexual assault, House of Cards was feeling stuck in the mud. The Underwoods’ journey to power had been fascinating their struggle to keep power, not so much. When Spacey was rightly dropped, the writers were forced to press on, with little time to rewrite the script as two episodes had already been filmed and needed completely redoing. Despite their best intentions, the final season was a mess – although the show’s legacy had already been tarnished by Spacey.Gogglebox’s premise is preposterously simple – film normal people watching television and capture their conversations. For such a basic recipe to work, all the ingredients need to be perfect, and, for a time, they were. Stephanie and Dominic Parker were the highlights for the first few seasons, and then the Moffatt family, with the quotable Scarlett, joined in the third series. However, fame soon caught up with both families, and they left the show one after the other. Their replacements have never been quite as good.The quality of Top Gear had long dwindled before Matt LeBlanc and Chris Evans took over from Jeremy Clarkson and co. It wasn’t until the trio finally left, though, that fans realised just how awful Top Gear could potentially be. LeBlanc and Evans had no chemistry, the pair awkwardly jostling with each other for screen-time. By the time their first series together had ended, Evans had received so much flack he decided to leave. Top Gear has not yet recovered – although everyone’s fingers are crossed in the hope that Chris Harris, Sabine Schmitz, Paddy McGuinness and Andrew Flintoff can return the show to its former glory.Sherlock made Benedict Cumberbatch a household name and had three stellar seasons before turning downhill. What great television those seasons were, with the modern take on the classic detective story proving a thrilling watch. Come the Christmas special and the writers had become too enthralled by their own mythos what was sold as a special episode, set in Victorian England, was actually modern-day Sherlock using drugs to e into his own subconscious. The episode was a mess – as was the following fourth season.Initially an addictive period drama, Downton Abbey slowly became more and more soapy. The point of no return came during the Christmas day episode “A Journey to the Highlands”, when – just moments after the birth of his child – Matthew Crawley was run over by a milk truck. Some fans were reportedly so outraged that they Tweeted how their Christmases were ruined.That 70s Show arguably had multiple “jump the shark” moments throughout its run. One such moment was when the writers introduced Brooke, who fell pregnant after a one-night stand with Ashton Kutcher’s Michael Kelso. The setup was merely a ploy to enable Kutcher to leave the show at the end of the season. Then there was the surprising revelation that Danny Masterson’s Steven Hyde had two fathers. But perhaps the moment that best signals the show’s downward spiral is when they decided to switch the actor who played Laurie Forman. After Lisa Robin Kelly had played Forman for five seasons, the showrunners unexpectedly – and without explanation – brought in Christina Moore to take over the character.1430 Buffy the Vampire SlayerBuffy has legions of fans, and for good reason. The first few seasons mesh funny quips and lovelorn lust to perfection, while it’s all strung together by a high-school story about a vampire-killing badass. Things started to waver slightly at the beginning of season six, when the series resolved their “is Buffy dead?” cliffhanger with the Scoobie gang resurrecting her. From there, the characters became shadows of their former selves, the story going to much darker places than before, including one controversial storyline about attempted rape. The show was never the same againStruggling to keep viewers watching, the writers of The Brady Bunch decided something needed to change. Rather than work with already-established characters, they decided to introduce a new child: Cousin Oliver, played by Robbie Rist, who was the show’s youngest actor (nine-years-old) at the time. This decision may have been intended to make The Brady Bunch “adorable” again, but viewers turned away at the obvious attempt to shoehorn something new into the show. The show was cancelled five episodes later and it sparked the phrase “Cousin Oliver Syndrome” – a trope where a show introduces a child character to boost ratings but fails. (Some fans believe the late introduction of Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s sister Dawn is an example of this.)1630 Two and a Half MenTwo and a Half Men was, for a long time, one of the most-watched TV series in the United States. Why exactly? Well, that would likely be down to Charlie Sheen, whose obnoxious, heightened version of himself (his character’s also named Charlie) charmed the nation. Sheen’s private life, though, soon outdid his fictional counterpart, with the actor going into rehab and making headlines with his bizarre rants (winning!). The network took notice and replaced Sheen with Ashton Kutcher, whose naïve-shtick never quite worked.The first seasons of Battlestar Galactica (the updated series) were phenomenal television, but that did not stop the science fiction show having some slightly questionable moments. Perhaps the most famous came towards the season three finale, when the five remaining Cylons (human replicas) are outed. They are discovered (or discover themselves) when the Final Five – Tory, Colonel Tigh, Tyrol, and Anders – all come together after hearing a version of Bob Dylan’s “All Along the Watchtower”. It’s cumbersome, silly, and the tipping point for the once great show.The famous British poet John Cooper Clarke has argued many times that The Simpsons was one of best shows on television. “There is no better spokesperson for the modern proletarian male than Homer J Simpson,” he once said. Clarke was likely referring to only the first dozen or so seasons of The Simpsons as, since then, the animated show about the eponymous blue-collar family has suffered in its attempts to remain quite as relevant and funny. Season 30, as a result, contains the least-watched episode of The Simpsons ever: less than two million tuned in to the episode “I\u0027m Dancing as Fat as I Can”, guest starring Netflix boss Ted Sarandos.Despite stellar reviews and an adoring (if somewhat small) fanbase, Arrested Development was cancelled after its third season. Arrested Development should probably have stayed cancelled. Netflix brought back the acclaimed series for a fourth season in 2013, changing the format so each episode centred on a different character. Critics called the new approach awkward, saying it missed the character interactions that made the show so great. The showrunners seemingly agreed as they later released a remixed version of season four that followed the classic formula. That release came just before season five which has, to put it lightly, been decimated by critics. As Michael Bluth would say: “I don’t know what I expected.”Anthology series are hard to get right. On the one hand, each season can be completely different, allowing for creativity to flourish. On the other, writers need to somehow make sure that each season still feels like the same show, otherwise they risk alienating fans.Unlike the UK Office, the American counterpart went on too long. Steve Carell as Michael Scott was the heart of the show, and his departure in season seven was a massive hit for the series. Even comedy heavyweight Will Ferrell couldn’t fill the void left by Carell. And while the show was certainly never awful, the final episodes could not compete with the glorious highs of previous seasons.After eight seasons, Smallville was already losing fans, many of whom were desperately waiting for Superman to finally wear the suit (they would have to wait for the final episode). Romances were already growing too prolonged and then the superhero’s arch-nemesis, Lex Luthor, decided to leave. With his contract complete, actor Michael Rosenbaum decided to jump ship, and the show never found a villain that could match him.Where does Prison Break go when the inmates break out of prison? That was a question many were left asking following the season one finale, which saw the main gang escape Fox River State Penitentiary. There was still some gas left in the engine for season two as they went on the run, but the decision to send them back to prison for season three saw the story retreading already well-worn ground.The X-Files masterfully kept viewers enthralled by its science fiction mysteries for eight seasons. Mulder and Scully were key to that David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson’s chemistry electrified the show while keeping everything grounded. Unfortunately, due to contract arrangements, Mulder was written out during the season eight finale. That left the show in the hands of two other agents, John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), who were short-changed with an incoherent storyline. As a result, the show was cancelled in 2002 – only to be brought back, with Duchovny and Anderson on board, in 2016.Although one of the most influential comedies of all time, Seinfeld was not without its faults. Season nine, the final one, marks a blemish on the iconic show’s history. Larry David, the highlight of season six through eight, was relegated to guest and only wrote the season finale. The other writers, meanwhile, were struggling to come up with new ideas – something that ironically proved the downfall for the show famously about nothing.Glee was a phenomenon. For a few years, Gleeks – fans of the show – were everywhere. That is until season three. The whimsy soon wore off as fans believed the show had become too overtly cheesy. Still, the Gleeks kept on singing, and the show continued for another three seasons.The late Noughties were a wonderful time for anti-heroes on television. Following in the footsteps of Tony Soprano were Mad Men’s Don Draper, Breaking Bad’s Walter White, and Dexter’s Dexter Morgan. While Don and Walter have become unquestioned pop-culture icons thanks to their series being of such phenomenal quality, Dexter’s legacy has become mired by two dire seasons and an unsatisfying conclusion. Season six was the first time the fictional serial killer dropped the baton. And while Dexter recovered for season seven, the following final few episodes were so unanimously panned that even the leading actor, Michael C Hall, reportedly thought they were awful.While Greg Wallace and Antony Worrall Thompson may have been the first two hosts of Saturday Kitchen, it was James Martin who really made the show a success. Under his steady guidance, viewership increased from 1.2 million to around 2.5 million and the cookery programme became a staple weekend watch. No replacement host has been brought on board since Martin left in 2016, and the show has suffered as a result. At least the Keith Floyd and Rick Stein repeats are as good as ever. What started as a critically adored Buff the Vampire Slayer spin-off soon became a run-of-the-mill drama. Angel started with its focus on the eponymous vampire-with-a-heart working as a private detective and saving humans from other demons. However, after Angel came to terms with his ongoing struggle between his human side and his vampire side, the show became a little stale. Season three was filled with filler episodes and shallow villains. Then came season four a narrative mess that struggled to reconcile the characters Cordelia and Connor. Even with the stellar episode Spin the Bottle in the mix, many fans were unimpressed by the direction the show had gone in.David Lynch’s dreamy murder mystery has become a cult classic, and for good reason. The first season was wonderfully strange and melodramatic. Then the network began putting pressure on Lynch to reveal to the world who killed Laura Palmer. Lynch had not wanted to reveal the murderer but was forced to. The show lacked the same drive after the discovery. Considering the showrunner himself has said the second season “sucked” it’s no stretch to say that it jumped the shark.130 Parks and RecreationParks and Recreation’s sixth season was filmed while Chris Pratt was on the cusp of becoming a global megastar.

I can’t see us doing any more of it.”Inbetweeners star says there are ‘no pros to being famous’The Inbetweeners star apologises for reunion specialBird is the latest Inbetweeners star to pour cold water on a reboot, with James Buckley, who played Jay on the series, explaining in March that a much-maligned Channel 4 reunion broadcast at the start of 2019 was such a disaster that he no longer wanted to revisit the show itself.“It was maybe a mistake doing that reunion,” he told Heart Radio. “Me personally, I don’t want to ruin The Inbetweeners any more. At the moment, I wouldn’t want to go anywhere near it.”The reunion, hosted by Jimmy Carr, saw the stars of the series participate in an Inbetweeners quiz, a fake award ceremony and watch old clips from the show. Critics dubbed the two-hour special “shambolic”, with Buckley later apologising for it on Twitter.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

As is the case with disabling read receipts, hiding your ‘last seen’ time will also stop you from seeing anybody else’s.You can control how much data you munch through on WhatsApp by limiting the types of media you automatically download on a mobile connection. Go to Settings \u0026gt Data Usage and choose the best option for you. If you’re expecting an important WhatsApp message from someone, set a custom notification for them by opening the chat, tapping their name at the top and hitting Custom Notifications.612 Format your messagesTo jazz up any of your messages, simply highlight it by tapping and holding it, hit the More Options key on the pop-up menu and tap the formatting option you want - bold, italic, strikethrough or monospace.You can get Siri or Google Assistant to type your WhatsApp messages out for you by saying either “Hey Siri” or “Okay Google”, followed by the name of the person you want to message and the actual contents of the message. 812 Mark chats as unreadWhen you’ve read a message but can’t reply to it straight away, you can set a visual reminder by marking it as unread. On Android, long-press the conversation, and on iOS, swipe from left to right on a chat.You almost certainly won’t do this on a regular basis, but it’s a handy option to have. You can export entire conversations - complete with emoji and media attachments - by hitting More inside a chat a selecting Email Chat.You can send the same message to lots of your contacts without lumping them all into one group, much like the BCC option on email, by hitting the New Broadcast option on the app’s main menu.You pin up to three contacts and groups to the top of your WhatsApp conversation list by tapping and holding a chat, then hitting the pin icon. 1212 Make things easier to findYou can easily mark key messages with a star, allowing you to find them easily when you need to. Just tap and hold a message and hit the star icon to save it, and return to it later by selecting Starred Messages in WhatsApp’s main menu.Options range from 30 seconds to one hour, with Telegram claiming it will “make conversations in the group more orderly while raising the value of each inidual message”.\u0026nbspGroup admins will also be able to assign titles to group members through a new option in Group Settings.Other features included in the new update include animated emoji, which adds movement to the heart, thumbs up, unamused face, flushed face, and partying face emoji.Telegram often pioneers new features that are subsequently adopted by other messaging apps like WhatsApp.\u0026nbspFor example, Whatsapp introduced stickers in 2018 – three years after Telegram had first launched the feature on its platform.The latest Telegram update will be rolled out over the coming days to users around the world, though there will be slight differences for Android and iOS users.The main features will be included for both mobile operating systems, however Android users will also find a new attachment menu that makes it easier to pick photos and videos to send to contacts.Meanwhile, iOS users will now be able to choose accent colours for night themes, so the dark mode will no longer simply be shades of black and blue.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

“reassure the public” the government is prepared to leave without a deal.In his capacity as the chancellor of Duchy of Lancaster, Mr Gove will launch the unit as part of his role in leading the government’s preparations for a no-deal exit on 31 October – now considered No 10’s “top priority”.Confirming the move on Monday, a spokesperson for the Cabinet Office told The Independent it would keep a close watch\u0026nbspon articles related to Brexit.“All government departments are responsible for responding to inaccurate media reporting in their areas,” a spokesperson said.Created with

added: “A team focusing on reacting quickly to Brexit-related stories is being established as part of preparations to leave the EU on 31 October, so as to reassure the public that the government will be full prepared for the UK to leave then, whatever the circumstances.”But opposition parties at Westminster seized on the establishment of the rapid rebuttal unit. \u0026nbsp“Setting up a no-deal spin unit is a pointless waste of taxpayers’ money, and will do nothing to help avoid the years of chaos and uncertainty that will follow,” said Labour’s shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett.\u0026nbspGove is in charge of government’s\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit preparations (Reuters)The Liberal Democrats’ Brexit spokesperson, Tom Brake, added: “The British public deserve the truth about the realities of what no deal will entail for the British people, but this is not what Gove’s rebuttal unit will provide.“It will be nothing more than a spin machine trying to mask the danger and chaos a no deal will cause, with the cost coming out of the public purse.“Rebuttal units in the past have been nothing more than a colossal waste of time and money. It is another shameful amount of money the Conservatives can add to their Brexit tab.”The Sunday \u0026nbspclaimed the unit will respond to “media myths and half truths” about the risks of a no-deal Brexit and will ensure the “public and businesses are not being alarmed by scare stories or falsehoods”.Sterling plunges to 10-year low against euro on no-deal Brexit fearsBrexit legislation around environmental protections ‘must be revealed’Caroline Lucas proposes all-female ‘emergency cabinet’ to stop BrexitReferendum campaigners to ‘focus on democratic outrage of no deal’Will Boris Johnson be able to make an election all about Brexit?The newspaper quoted one insider, adding it could “take a variety of forms: from correcting inaccuracies at source to issuing tweets or directly reassuring stakeholders like businesses,\u0026nbspto publishing factual blogs”.“While no deal may present some challenges, scare stories and misinformation are designed to obstruct democracy and prevent us leaving,” they said. “The new Cabinet Office rebuttal unit will work to combat fake news and fear mongering to help ensure businesses and citizens are Brexit-ready for 31 October.”It came as Robert Buckland, the\u0026nbspjustice secretary, confirmed he still believed the impact of crashing out of the EU would be chaos, as he was reminded of his previous comments on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.\u0026nbspBut he attempted to defend his choice of words,\u0026nbspclaiming “there is a difference between crashing out and not achieving a deal”, and said ongoing work will “avoid the chaos of a crash-out”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The reality is that any use of a phone distracts from a driver’s ability to pay full attention, and the government should consider extending the ban to reflect this.”RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said: “We support the committee’s call for the government to look more closely at the effectiveness of the increase of the penalties in 2017, and key to this is whether enforcement is adequate and whether the police have sufficient resources and technology to be able to crack down on this scourge.”A Department for Transport spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “While mobile phones are a vital part of modern life and business, drivers must always use them safely and responsibly.“Being distracted by a mobile phone while driving is dangerous and puts people’s lives at risk. The law is clear that anyone driving dangerously is committing a criminal offence.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Policymakers have looked for an explanation in the so-called supply side of the economy – the ways in which goods are made and services delivered – and pointed to declining technological innovation and cheap loans keeping unproductive “zombie” firms afloat, among other possible reasons.\u0026nbspBut the New Economics Foundation says its research shows that the government must also look at the demand side – the level and nature of spending across the country.\u0026nbsp“Average productivity, wages and living standards have experienced their worst decade in almost two centuries. It is increasingly clear that weak demand has been the overlooked problem,” said Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the think tank.\u0026nbsp“Raising demand by putting more cash in the pockets of the UK’s poorest workers, while giving people more paid time off from work to spend it, should now be part of a radical mix of options for any government that is serious about increasing productivity in a way that works for people and society.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Britain’s Jamie Chadwick wins first-ever W Series title.

Instead, companies rely on cheaper labour that can be shed quickly if demand doesn’t improve. As a result, productivity does not improve.The New Economics Foundation finds evidence of exactly this in official data.\u0026nbspIt says that since 2012, firms have increasingly preferred to hire rather than to invest and that, relative to all employees, the proportion of zero-hour and self-employed workers, as well as one-person “micro-companies”, has grown by two fifths since before the financial crisis. The corresponding lack of investment now explains at least a quarter of the UK’s gap in productivity with the historical trend.A report by the New Economics Foundation sets out a number of measures to lift demand, including gradual increases in statutory paid holiday and faster rises in the minimum wage.\u0026nbsp“The evidence shows that increased leisure time for workers can be expected to increase economy-wide demand,” the think tank says.It adds: “Increasing minimum wages is a particularly efficient way of boosting demand because workers on minimum wages are far more likely to spend rather than save any increases in salary, compared with higher-income iniduals.”Based on the same logic, the report recommends abolishing the personal allowance of income tax and using the extra public revenue on direct payouts to consumers and an increase in child benefit. It says this will redistribute £8bn a year from the richest 35 per cent of households to the remaining 65 per cent, with most of the gains concentrated on the poorest 10 per cent.\u0026nbspThe think tank also argues the government should frontload a large share of investment required to turn Britain into a zero-carbon economy over the next five years, in order to boost demand.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s not clear what the final toll is.\u0026nbspTrump in ‘bizarre’ nuclear-powered missile claim after Russia blastRussia admits deadly blast was caused by nuclear reactor accidentMore than 300 anti-Putin protesters arrested in RussiaThe company said the victims were on a sea platform testing a rocket engine and were thrown into the sea by explosion.\u0026nbspRosatom director Alexei Likhachev praised the victims as true heroes and the pride of our country.\u0026nbspOur further work on new weapons that we will certainly complete will be the best tribute to them, Mr Likhachev said during the funeral, according to Rosatom. We will fulfil the Motherland\u0027s orders and fully protect its security.\u0026nbspFollowing the explosion, Russian authorities also closed part of Dvina Bay on the White Sea to shipping for a month, in what could be an attempt to prevent outsiders from seeing an operation to recover the missile debris.\u0026nbspThe Severodvinsk city administration said the radiation level rose to 2 microsieverts per hour for about 30 minutes on Thursday before returning to the area\u0027s natural level of 0.1 microsieverts per hour. Emergency officials issued a warning to all workers to stay indoors and close the windows.\u0026nbspThe radiation level of 2 microsieverts per hour is only slightly higher than the natural background radiation, which could vary between 0.1 and 0.4 microsieverts per hour. It\u0027s lower than the cosmic radiation that plane passengers are exposed to on longer haul flights.\u0026nbspRussian environmental groups have urged the government to release details of the radioactive leak, but officials offered no further details.\u0026nbspNeither the Defence Ministry nor Rosatom mentioned the type of rocket that exploded during the test, saying only that it had liquid propellant.\u0026nbspBut Rosatom\u0027s mention of a nuclear isotope power source led some Russian media to conclude it was the Burevestnik (Petrel), a nuclear-powered cruise missile first revealed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in March 2018 during his state of the nation address along with other doomsday weapons.\u0026nbspWhile presenting the new missile, Putin claimed it will have an unlimited range, allowing it to circle the globe unnoticed, bypassing the enemy\u0027s missile defense assets to strike undetected. The president claimed the missile had successfully undergone the first tests, but observers were skeptical, arguing that such a weapon could be very difficult to handle and harmful to the environment.\u0026nbspSome reports suggested previous tests of the Burevestnik missile had been conducted on the barren Arctic archipelago of Novaya Zemlya and the Kapustin Yar testing range in southern Russia before they were moved to Nyonoksa.Moving the tests from unpopulated areas to a range close to a big city may reflect the military\u0027s increased confidence in the new weapon.\u0026nbspAdditional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Arab, explains how he has lost $1000s of dollars being displaced due to the water crisis in Iraq (Photo: Bel Trew)A United Nations report released last month warned that the world is heading for a “climate apartheid” scenario, “where the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict while the rest of the world is left to suffer”.\u0026nbspIn Baghdad, that is already a reality. On 48C\u0026nbspdays, which are now coming earlier in the year, air conditioners are the most effective way of staying cool. But an electricity crisis in the country is putting even that essential tool out of reach to low-income families.\u0026nbspThe crisis – caused by a combination of corruption, mismanagement and a creaking national grid\u0026nbsp– has exacerbated the country’s energy ide. The result is a huge gap between electricity supply and demand, especially in the summer. A diesel generator can be used to meet some of the shortfall, but running an air conditioner from a generator is a luxury only a few can afford.\u0026nbsp“The electricity is completely unpredictable,” says Abu Ahmed, a metal shop owner just down the street from Muhammad. “Sometimes it comes on at 10am and lasts all day, sometimes it’s only one hour. The air conditioner is out of the question without the government grid.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAbu Ahmed pays around £50 a month to run a generator that gives him a supply of four amps of electricity. That is all he can afford. If he goes over the allotted amps, the power turns off. \u0026nbsp“I can run the fridge and the lights, that’s all,” he says. “I can’t sleep at night and I’m always sweating.”Boiling Basra: Iraq’s water crisis threatens to destabilise the regionIraq’s electricity crisis may be a local problem, but the inequality of keeping cool is a global issue that is likely to become more relevant as temperatures rise.\u0026nbspNearly 2.8 billion people live in countries where the average daily temperature is greater than 25C, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), and less than 10 per cent of them own an air conditioner. The agency estimates that by 2050, 1.9 billion people living in hot countries will be without access to an air conditioner.\u0026nbspProfessor Philip Alston, the UN’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights and author of the “climate apartheid” report, says the lives of the world’s poorest will be at risk.\u0026nbsp“The ever-higher record temperatures that will be recorded in Iraq and around the world will put vast numbers of vulnerable iniduals at grave risk. Children, older persons, those who are already ill or are just not very strong, will all be at risk of dying from excessive heat,” he tells The Independent.\u0026nbspAFPGetty)“The only way for some of these to get a degree of protection will be from air conditioning. But that costs money both for the system or the equipment as well as for electricity. The poorest people will often have neither access nor the money needed to have access to such relief.”\u0026nbspIraqi cities have some advantages over Europe when it comes to dealing with extreme temperatures. Its neighbourhoods and homes were designed with the heat in mind. Narrow streets carry the wind through tall windows, cool air flows up from the basements in older houses.\u0026nbspAs the recent heatwaves in Paris, London and Berlin have shown, European countries are significantly less well-equipped to deal with these higher temperatures.\u0026nbspLast month’s record-breaking temperature of 38.7C\u0026nbspin the UK prompted apocalyptic headlines, transport chaos and a spate of government health warnings –\u0026nbspand for good reason.\u0026nbspHigh temperatures in Europe are usually accompanied by a spike in deaths, usually among the elderly and people with heart and lung conditions. In 2003, a heatwave caused an additional 70,000 deaths across the continent. The British parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee has warned that Britain faces 7,000 heat-related deaths every year by 2050 unless action is taken.\u0026nbspAs it stands today, Europe is ill-prepared. The IEA estimates that less than 5 per cent of European households are air-conditioned, but it adds that air conditioning could become one of the top drivers of global electricity demand within a few decades.The UK’s Met Office describes heatwaves as “extreme weather events,” but adds that with climate change they are likely to become more frequent. Its own projections show that heatwaves could occur on average as regularly as every other year by the middle of the century.\u0026nbspChildren, older persons, those who are already ill or are just not very strong, will all be at risk of dying from excessive heatThe rise in temperature is likely to have an impact on how we work, too. According to the International Labour Organisation, the best-case scenario predictions for the level of warming would result in a 2.2 per cent reduction of global working hours due to heat stress by 2030, the equivalent of 80 million full-time jobs.\u0026nbspBut as Europe considers a future of climate crises, here again, Iraq is years ahead. Muhammad, the hardware store worker, knows very well how the heat can stop you in its tracks.\u0026nbsp“This job is easy, I don’t move around so much. But it takes an extra effort to do anything. Other jobs, like labouring, is much more difficult.”\u0026nbspAnd while European countries may at least have the time and means to adapt, Iraq is fast approaching an environmental disaster. \u0026nbspAFPGetty)A 2018,\u0026nbspreport produced by a group of academics from the EastWest Institute and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) described Iraq as “one of the Middle East’s most climate-vulnerable countries”.“Climate change is currently manifesting itself in prolonged heat waves, erratic precipitation, higher than average temperatures and increased disaster intensity,” the report says, adding a prediction that the country’s mean annual temperature will increase by 2C\u0026nbspby 2050.Mahmoud Abdul Latif Hamed, a weather forecaster and manager of environment at Iraq’s Meteorological Organisation, says Iraq is experiencing extreme temperatures earlier in the year. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“In 2011, the temperature in Baghdad reached 50C\u0026nbspin August. Now it’s June and the temperature in Baghdad is already 49C. That means there has been a two-month shift in reading the temperature,” he says.\u0026nbsp“Fifty degrees is very dangerous if you’re out in the open. For the poor it is even more dangerous. They have no air conditioning to cool down.”According to Hamed, there are things the government can do to deal with the extreme heat.\u0026nbsp“The ideal solution is to make more vegetation, which can lower temperatures. And we need to remove all the factories and old technology,” he says. \u0026nbspBut despite Iraq’s massive oil wealth, corruption is hampering reform and Iraqis are furious. Last summer, deadly protests erupted in the southern city of Basra over the government’s inability to provide reliable electricity and water. The government has promised to invest billions in improving the national grid, but few have noticed the difference so far.\u0026nbspProtesters have been back on the streets this year in anticipation of another sweltering summer.\u0026nbsp“We expect the future climate of Iraq to be very dangerous,” Hamed,\u0026nbspsays. “I expect that if the issue isn’t fixed, it will bring down the government.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

a street gang which formed in the late s - and started attending their parties.And as the violence in her neighbourhood raged, she became increasingly drawn to the protection and respect gang membership would bring.Local journalist Frank Main said: Her friends started getting shot and I think that she got sucked into gang le and she realised that’s where she’s going to get respect and honour and the warm fuzzies that other kids get from playing basketball or playing chess or something in high school.Shed originally wanted to become a social worker, but as she became more involved with the Gangster Disciples her priorities turned to status and reputation.Her le changed completely at  when one of her fellow gang members and friends, Shondale Tooka Gregory, was shot and killed by members of a rival gang in .To make the slaying even more incendiary, Tookas killers mocked him on social media after the murder — even going as far as to edit toilet paper into a picture of Tooka dead in his casket.This online savagery and threatening each other on social media - known as cyber-banging - turned Gakirahs grief into rage.In fact the escalation in hatred between the gangs that followed was so extreme that Lee Caldwell of Chicagos Gang Safety Team said: Essentially, this image started a gang conflict.Later that year, -year-old Odee Perry, who was suspected of killing Tooka, was shot dead.An all-out gang war began, with the Gangster Disciples renaming their territory Tookaville and the Black Disciples calling theirs O Block in their fallen members honour.Although Gakirah was never charged with Odees murder, people thought she was the one who pulled the trigger.Frank Main said: It gave her a giant reputation as a shooter.If you are a teenager in a gang in Chicago and you kill somebody, your status rockets.Gakirahs street cred exploded online too as she amassed nearly , followers on Twitter a huge number in the early days of the site.Her popularity came from how openly she showed off her gangster lestyle, including by threatening others on the social media network.She also started appearing in Drill rap music videos posing with guns and fists full of dollars.Garkirah, who was also known as KI - thought to be an abbreviation of her first name - appears in one video from the Fly Boy Gang in a song called Murda.She even gets referenced directly in the line KI my young killa and is seen in the video wearing a bandanna covering her face and pointing an automatic gun at the camera.The local rap scene adored her — with rappers from rival gangs following and flirting with her on Twitter.Angalia Bianca, a former Chicago gang member, said: She was a real badass gangster girl — every bit the definition.For females,you want to keep that kind of respect, she was never going to stop.And Professor Desmond Patton, who studied Gakirahs online presence, said: She wanted to be the toughest person she could be in that gang.Her reputation as gangster girl every bit as violent as the boys only grew as the violence in Chicagos South Side got worse.And the year after the murders of Tooka and Odee, Gakirahs deadly rage would be intensied by the loss of another loved one.Tyquan Tyler, a family friend of Gakirahs from outside the city, was just  years old when he came to visit her.The pair were leaving a party in a group when several men started firing into the crowd.They were targeting someone  — but Tyquan was hit in the chest, and he died in a childrens hospital several hours later.Gakirahs friend, who was with her that evening, said shed never seen the hardened gangster cry like she did that night.Gakirah took up the Twitter handle Tyquanassassin in remembrance and wrote: Tyquan supposed  Be hear wit me But instead Lil bro ended up  feet under a million miles away.But the brutal aggravation wouldnt end for Gakirah.In March , her friend Raason Lil B Shaw was fatally gunned down in a foot chase with police when cops said he pulled a pistol on them.Again she tweeted her agony, writing: Da pain unbearable.But it wasnt long after that she wrote: Police took my homie I dedicate my le  his revenge .Around the same time, a member of a rival gang Black Disciples named Blood Money was shot dead.Word on the street said Gakirah was the killer, though again police didnt charge her with the murder.But in a city which saw , murders between -, the rumours were enough for Blood Moneys friends to want revenge.The situation was accelerated when one of Gakirahs fellow gang members, Lil Jay, posted a  video of himself bragging on Instagram.In it, he drinks a red-coloured liquid and the caption reads: Sippin on Blood Money.With the word out that Gakirah was responsible for the killing, her le was in serious danger.On April  , she tweeted: I Dne seen  many of my n****z in a casket... In da end we DIE.The next day, Gakirah was walking to a friends house when a hooded man walked up to her.He shot her a total of nine times, leaving her bleeding to death on the pavement before making his get away.She managed to crawl to the steps of a house nearby where she lost consciousness.Gakirah died in a hospital bed two hours later at just  years old.Reporter Frank Main said: The novelty of Gakirah the gang assassin being shot down was huge.She was thought to be one of the most notorious shooters in the history of that neighbourhood – and she’s girl.Within hours of the news breaking, her death was being mocked by rival gang members online.Academics trying to end the cycle of gang violence in Chicago have since studied Gakirahs tweets to look for insights.Using articial intelligence, theyre trying to identy which online threats usually turn into actual street violence.Professor Desmond Patton said: Expressions of grief and loss often come before a more aggressive and threatening tweet – perfect time for an intervention.Speaking of Gakirah specically, he added: She almost didn’t seem realThere was this devilish, monstrous little girl who was going around killing people and that she also talked about on this online.Secret Le of a Gang Girl is on Crime and Investigation tonight at pm. "},{"url":null,"title":"paul hollywood only has himself to blame","story":"Actually, Summer Monteys-Fullam ran out of the door after being told she had to sign a draconian non- disclosure agreement, vowing not to give away any details of her affair with the Bake Off dough boy.Apparently, she thought she was going to receive a romantic proposal and engagement ring but instead was presented with a cold, legal document that all but screamed: “I don’t trust you.”She decided to pack up all her crop tops and tight jeans and flee as fast as her lithe, -year-old legs would carry her.We are told Hollywood, , charmingly bellowed after her: “Why don’t you f*** off back on that horse you rode in on ”Not exactly the stuff of tender romance, I’m sure you will agree. But let’s be honest, I think we all knew this midle crisis of a romance would end in tears.For a start it all played out in the public eye like a soap opera, which never bodes well.Paul, who bizarrely seems to be regardedas some sort of sex symbol, has not exactly covered himself in glory when it comes to his love le.Don’t forget that back in , he cheated on ex-we Alex with his cutesy-pie American co-presenter.That was when he went to the US hoping to cash in on his Bake Off fame and attempted to build a lucrative career across the pond.The affair with Marcela ­Valladolid might have generated a lot of free publicity and media attention, but his bid for transatlantic success never took off.He came home with his tail between his legs and had to eat a great big entire humble pie to win back his we.We don’t ever know what goes on inside a marriage, but Alex took him back, possibly for the sake of their teenage son Josh.At the same time she appeared on my show to kick-start her own career as a cook.She was very good, with a no-nonsense, immensely likeable personality — and her food was delicious. She’s since become a celebrity chef in her own right.I recall that Alex brought her sheepish husband along with her that morning for her first appearance on live TV.Perhaps it was for moral support, but I reckon it was more likely to keep an eye on him. He did his best impersonation of a penitent man and they somehow managed to reheat the souffle.Of course, it didn’t last.They split up in  and that same year, Hollywood began his relationship with ex- barmaid Summer.Alex was convinced the affair began before they finally split but this was vehemently denied by both Paul and Summer.Paul and Alex, of course, are now orced. And he apparently faces an imminent court battle over cash.Alex could even end up with half her ex-husband’s ­estimated £million fortune.She is currently enjoying a holiday in France, where she was photographed looking chic, cool and effortlessly ­elegant.No one could fail to forgive her for feeling a bit smug that her ex has been so publicly dumped. After all, she had to bear her share of public humiliation over his behaviour.Meanwhile, it gets worse and worse for Paul, as inevitably there is now talk of ­Summer writing a book and appearing in a clutch of reality shows.She didn’t sign the NDA so is completely free to warble about their sex le and all sorts of potentially embarrassing revelationsshe wishes.So it looks like Paul is leaving Summer behind him and entering the autumn and winter of his le alone, with only himself to blame.I’ve just gobbled up the entire new BBC series Fosse Verdon about the hugely talented husband and we team who, among many other hits, gave us musicals Sweet Charity, Cabaret and Chicago.It’s gratying to see Broadway legend Gwen Verdon finally given the acclaim she deserves for the part she played in Bob Fosse’s success.He was a genius choreographer and director but also a notorious womaniser, chain-smoker, heavy drinker and pill popper.This series never shies away from Fosse’s sleazy side, showing how manipulative he could be – and his seduction of vulnerable young actresses and dancers is not easy to watch.We are light years from the #MeToo movement, and this series illustrates why we need it so much.Sam Rockwell plays a blinder as Fosse, but Michelle Williams is a revelation as Gwen Verdon.It’s as though the red-headed dancing star has been brought back to le.You know those stock responses you get after stating the bleedin’ obvious – about the Pope being Catholic and bears defecating in the woods.There is another one which I always thought was very callous.“Does Rose Kennedy own a black dress ”This is particularly unfeeling given the many tragedies visited upon the Kennedy clan – continuing right up to the present day.Theirs is a long litany of pain and suffering.Matriarch Rose endured the death of her eldest son Joe during World War Two, before the unimaginable ordeal of seeing two more sons publicly gunned down.First when John, as US President, was assassinated in . Then his younger brother Bobby, the former Attorney General turned senator and presidential candidate, was brutally slain in .The “Kennedy curse” has persisted through the decades.Twenty years ago, John F Kennedy Jnr, JFK’s only son, died while flying his light aircraft to the Massachusetts island of Martha’s Vineyard when it crashed into the ocean.In , Mary Kennedy, the estranged we of Robert Kennedy Jr – Bobby’s son – was found dead in her New York home, having apparently taken her own le.And this week, the family gathered for yet another tragic occasion.This time it was the funeral of Bobby’s -year-old granddaughter Saoirse Kennedy Hill, who died from a suspected overdose at the family compound in Cape Cod.Rose died in  aged .She was spared witnessing the deaths of some of the younger members of the family, including poor Saoirse.But after all she endured during her long le, she deserves a bit more respect and understanding than being the punchline to a weak joke.Whoever signed up Michelle Visage for Strictly Come Dancing deserves a pay rise.Michelle, right, one of the stars of the fabulous RuPaul’s Drag Race, will be a firecracker of an addition to Strictly. She’s sassy, sexy, ballsy and a real grafter.She has a wonderful dirty laugh and a terric outlook and she’ll seize this show by the throat.I’d have paid real money to have seen her reduce sacked former pro Brendan Cole to a whimpering jellyfish.It’s a huge shame that’s no longer a possibility, but bosses need to make sure Michelle is paired with a young, hungry dancer not afraid to take risks.There could perhaps be a chance for Kevin Clton to win two Glitterballs in a row after his success with Stacey Dooley last year.Kevin and Michelle could really burn up that dance floor and there would be no hanky panky from this loyal woman whose -year marriage to hubby David is rock solid.So no Strictly “curse”, but knowing Michelle, maybe rather a lot of Strictly cursing.Her big-heartedness remains undimmed even under the cruel shadow of Alzheimer’s, so it was no surprise that Dame Barbara Windsor used her nd birthday this week to demand more action to help fellow sufferers and their families.While other entertainers with long careers might have used their special day just to celebrate their achievements, Dame Barbara instead pleaded for us all to show compassion towards those with dementia, and for the Government to ensure more resources are made available.Barbara and her devoted husband Scott Mitchell have become ambassadors for the Alzheimer’s Society charity and have sent an open letter to Boris Johnson to sort out the care crisis that is making le so very hard for everyone affected by this disease.Now Boris might profess to being unafraid of all of the EU grandees as he tries to deliver Brexit, but he should be quaking in his boots at the prospect of the wrath of our Barbarahe doesn’t deliver vital help and money to those affected by dementia.More power to this incredible woman and how lucky she is to have Scott to take care of her because, sadly, not everyone dealing with dementia has such a devoted partner.They have both made a huge dference in raising awareness and much-needed cash.When this horrible disease is finally vanquished, and one day it must be, we will never forget the part Barbara and Scott played. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we should all rejoice in that.DAMNING new statistics reveal the average wait for a non-urgent GP appointment is now more than two weeks.This is simply not good enough.Boris Johnson promised in his first speech as Prime Minister that it was his job to make sure we don’t have to wait for weeks on end to see our doctor.The latest figures highlight the enormity of that task.There is a limit to what can be achieved by under-pressure health service staff and, though the PM has moved quickly to free up extra funding, there will never be an endless supply of money for the NHS, no matter who is in No.What is needed is serious reform and some radical thinking.Jeremy Corbyn will doubtless oppose any new ideas and continue using the NHS as a political football.Butthe Prime Minister can prove as single-minded on the health service as he is proving on Brexit, there is still hope.VAR made its Premier League debut on the opening weekend of the new season and had an instant impact.In spite of teething problems, it’s great to see the right decisions being reached by the video assistant referees — but fans should not be left in the dark while it happens.Refs should be mic’d up, like in rugby, so supporters can hear what’s going on.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They, like Madeleine’s parents, will be distraught, anxious, frightened, feeling all at sea and not knowing what best to do.”Three-year-old Madeleine from Rothley, Leics, was just nine days away from her fourth birthday when she disappeared from a holiday resort on Portugal’s Praia da Luz in May .Fteen-year-old Nora, from Balham, South West London, similarly vanished in mysterious circumstances on Sunday August , about  miles south of the capital Kuala Lumpur.Both Brit girls are feared to have been snatched by paedophiles on dferent continents  years apart. But eerie similarities exist.They were on family holidays, the eldest of younger siblings and vanished from their beds, dressed in pyjamas but barefooted.Mr Mitchell, speaking exclusively to The Sun Online, said: “A missing child on holiday, especially a young girl, raises alarm bells.Kate and Gerrys prayers are with this family and they are wishing them well.“They will need to maintain a momentum and keep up their hopes, as Kate and Gerry still do.They hope this girl can be found safe, alive and well as they continually hope for their own daughter.“After searching on the ground, andmaybe to no avail, they must continue looking, with private detectivesthey can.They are facing a similar ordeal to Kate and Gerry and it is heart wrenching.But this family has funding and appeals in place and have praised the Malaysian Police for their help.“They are searching with urgency for a missing girl, in a seemingly organised way, and it is like the initial search for Madeleine many years ago.This family need to keep it in the global eye and it’s good that British, French and Irish police are involved in this latest case.Meabh and Sebastien, parents of Nora, have offered a £, reward for information that could lead to her safeas they made an emotional plea saying their hearts are broken.A shaman, believed to be be able to summon spirits and drafted in by police, claimed Nora had been lured away from the eco-resort by a “genie.Mr Mitchell said it had all the echoes of Maddie’s disappearance with devout Catholics Kate and Gerry insisting their daughter was taken by a sex fiend.They have called on their religion for spiritual guidance and launched a public appeal which won backing from celebs, including soccer hero David Beckham and author JK Rowling.He said: “It brings all the memories back for them and they have done everything they can to keep Madeleine’s disappearance in the spotlight.Madeleine vanished from a holiday flat in The Algarve while her parents were dining with pals in a nearby tapas restaurant.She had been left sleeping alone with her younger twin siblings with regular half hour checks being made on them.Kate and Gerry cling on to a glimmer of hope that their daughter could still be alive. She would now be aged .Former GP turned medical worker Kate and heart doctor Gerry, both , have been calling on British tourists to take posters of their daughter on holiday to pin up and keep her face publicised.The welcome Government boost for the couple means the investigation codenamed Operation Grange, which has cost the British taxpayer £. million so far, will last until the end of March next year."},{"url":null,"title":"national grid power outage near misses","story":"It blamed Friday’s rare nationwide power cut on a slip in the grid’s frequency after two power generators shut down.The operator is already under investigation by the energy watchdog after the first blackout in more than a decade.But industry sources have toldthat the National Grid had been aware of the blackout problem for years and had warning signs.Since May there has been a severe dip in the grid’s frequency from its normal range of about Hz, it is claimed.Sources have claimed that the frequency has fallen below .Hz on three occasions in the past few months.All three units of EDF Energy’s West Burton power plant in Notts tripped offline and fell to the legal limit of .Hz in June.Last month, it fell to .Hz and in May it fell to .Hz.MOST READ IN UK NEWS\" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   MB-COMP-KISSING.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" ExclusiveLOIN OF DUTY Met Police poster girl faces sack after having sex on Nigerian Big Brother \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   TM-comp-Weird-Hair-v.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" THINNING BLUE LINE Cops warn trolls who mocked drug dealer’s hair they could be PROSECUTED \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   puma.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" URGENT HUNT Distressed boy,  or , got on bus alone in slippers  dressing gown at night \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   VP-COMP-CHEAT.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" RULE HIM OUT Jealous bloke sends girlfriend  rules for night out - then cheats on her \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-weather-.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" GALE ON EARTH TORNADO warning for Britain as heavy rain and gales to last all week \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" LatestDYING PLEA Teen, , banged on door crying help me as he was stabbed with ft machete They are thought to be the deepest UK falls since .

It’s our dark corner.”Epstein set about building an enormous stone mansion with cream-coloured walls and a bright turquoise roof surrounded by a maids’ quarters.Years later, and on the other southwest edge of the island, he built a square-shaped blue and white building resembling a religious temple, topped with a gold dome.Many have speculated that the child sex abuse Epstein has been accused of may have occurred in this secluded space.Workers claimed the structure was a music room, fitted with a grand piano and acoustic walls.But Epstein - a classically-trained pianist - positioned the building far away from other structures on the island.A medieval-style lock on the front of the temple became a curious point of conversation for those working on the site.Chicago-based contractor James Both shared his professional thoughts on the buildings door with Business Insider.Its styled like what you might see on a castle, with what appears to be a reinforcing lock bar across the face, he said.What makes it peculiar is thatyou wanted to keep people out, the bar would be placed inside the building, [but the] locking bar appears to be placed on the outside ... asit were intended to lock people in.The front of the building is flanked by statues painted in gold one which appears to be Poseidon, Greek god of the sea, and another that looks like a pair of birds.It is surrounded by a line of palm trees and a terrace with a labyrinth mot.A small structure downhill from the building has led some to believe it serves as a second entrance and suggest that the space extends underground.Both suggested: It is absolutely possible to install a dwelling and elevator underneath the structure.If an elevator was built there, [there] would most likely be a record with the vendor who installed the elevator, as they typically require yearly maintenance and inspection.Other curious details about the building have since emerged.It was constructed sometime between  and  - after Epsteins  guilty plea of soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution.The billionaire financier maintained a low profile after he received a lenient plea deal over claims he paid girls for sexual massages.Many began to believe his need for privacy appeared more sinister.The palm-fringed paradise became the subject of lurid rumours.Those who worked for Epstein in constructing the buildings said they signed non-disclosure agreements and refused to talk.Security guards keep watch along the islands shores.Before Epsteins  guilty plea, he would visit the island archipelago about two or three times a month for stays of three or four days, according to the former staffer who spoke to SF Gate.He described it as a Zen-like retreat where women would sometimes sunbathe topless or in the nude.At least one alleged victim has since spoken out about an orgy on the island she had with Epstein and others, in a court affidavit obtained by the Associated Press.The same victim said that she saw former President Bill Clinton on the island but never witnessed him having sex with anyone.A Clinton spokesman issued a statement denying the claims, saying Clinton never travelled to the island.Virginia Giuffre, previously Virginia Roberts, has recently alleged she was among a number of young girls who were abused by Epstein and others when she was a teenager.In a  lawsuit, Ms Giuffre claimed that she was a “sex slave” for Epstein, and that she was abused in his homes in New York, New Mexico, Florida, and the US Virgin Islands.Giuffre, now , said she was allegedly forced into “an orgy with numerous other under-aged girls.”She also made alarming claims involving the Duke of York, saying she “was forced to have sexual relations with [Prince Andrew] when she was a minor” at Epstein’s Little St James estate.A Buckingham Palace spokesperson told Sun Online: “It is emphatically denied The Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts.”She renewed her claims from  in an interview with the Miami Herald, saying she was  when she met Epstein, who she was introduced to by British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of Robert Maxwell.The mother-of-three said she was sent to Epstein’s private Caribbean island and groomed as a sex slave.Back in , police in Florida received reports Epstein had sexually abused underage girls in his mansion in Palm Beach.According to an indictment, Epstein recruited victims to provide massages, which they would perform nude or partially nude.Prosecutors said the encounters would become increasingly sexual, where Epstein would masturbate and ask victims to touch him while he did.According to court documents in Florida, authorities say at least  underage girls were brought into Epsteins Palm Beach mansion for what turned into sexual encounters.Courtney  Wild and Michelle Licata were part of a  criminal case brought against Epstein in FloridaWild was just  when she alleges Epstein forced her into performing sex acts on him, ABC News reported.She said: “I was , I had braces on.“Like, I remember standing in his kitchen ... and he also had a lot of girls there all the time.”Michelle Licata was aged  when she claims she was brought to the banker’s mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, where she was paid to give him a massage.She said: “He said, god, youre just so beautul and sexy and gorgeous and it was making me feel really uncomfortable.“Then he wanted me to rub his back, and he kept asking me to go lower and he was kind of talking to me.”Epstein was sentenced to only  months in jail."},{"url":null,"title":"map cramped seaworld orca whales car park lake space","story":"The image is being circulated by The Orca Project, an campaign group seeking to improve the rights or marine mammals in captivity.It shows a satellite view of the SeaWorld theme park in Orlando, Florida, with a yellow line encircling the car park, a red line around a lake on which visitors use paddle boats, and a blue line around a much smaller pool where orcas are kept.The Orca Project claim the resorts orcas spend their entire lives in the pool.SeaWorld is a chain of theme parks in the US and Abu Dhabi that host roller coasters, marine le shows, and other entertainment.The parks have long been the subject of controversy, with animal rights campaigners arguing that tanks are too small for the whales to grow healthily, to shallow to protect them from the sun, and the whales in captivity have dramatically short lespans than those in the wild.Last month, Virgin Holiday announced it would cease to sell packages to attractions such as SeaWorld, opting instead to promote more natural encounters with animals.In , a major documentary on the subject, entitled Blackfish, was released.It told the story of Tilikum, a whale previously held by Canadian park Sealand and sold to SeaWorld after he killed a woman who fell into his pool.Tilikum went on two kill two more people in separate incidents after arriving at SeaWorld Orlando, and the film argued argued the conditions in which he had been kept contributed to the deaths.The film was nominated for a BAFTA the year of its release and garnered critical acclaim.SeaWorld responded to the film with a statement which read: Blackfish ... is inaccurate and misleading and, regrettably, exploits a tragedy ....[T]he film paints a distorted picture that withholds ...key facts about SeaWorld—among them...that SeaWorld rescues, rehabilitates and s to the wild hundreds of wild animals every year, and that SeaWorld commits millions of dollars annually to conservation and scientic research.The Orca Project said they hope to get these magnicent orcas retired to a coastal sanctuary so they can live out their lives in their natural habitat.One user responded to the image saying: We have been to sea world and seen this many times they are magnicent creatures and it’s an awful le they have.It has to be freedom for them.Another said: When I visited a few years ago I was shocked.Hundreds of rays in a tiny tank, bears in a ‘arctic’ set up, manatees all in cramped quarters."},{"url":null,"title":"lottery couple

After two years of planning then a whole year of trekking, Ash Dykes, , finished his expedition yesterday. He became a viral sensation all over China as millions followed his progress on the internet and on TV. In the early stages he was followed for two days by a pack of hungry wolves which had just killed a local woman. The route took him ,ft above sea level and he endured both blizzards and baking heat, with temperatures as low as minus-C and as high as C. Ash, from Old Colwyn in North Wales, said: “It’s an unreal feeling to cross the finish line. It’ll take a while to sink in. But it’s such a special moment – history is created.”    Four of his team dropped out on the first day after suffering extreme altitude sickness and refusing to go ahead for fear of wolf and bear attacks. Ash pressed on with just one guide and a trusty pack horse called Caster Troy. He said: “Before we heard the wolves we filmed the locals speaking to us in a dialect we didn’t really understand. “It was only  months later that our editor was going through the footage and said they were telling us not to go into the valley because a woman had been killed by wolves the day before.”  At ious stages Ash was joined by Chinese social media influencers who kept their followers updated on his trek. He said: “One guy joined me to livestream and we had more than .million viewers. The comments were coming so fast you couldn’t read any of the questions. “People in China have been amazed to see parts of their country they have never seen before, especially the people in the cities.”  He added: “This has been more than a personal achievement it is unlocking human potential. While every corner of the planet is occupied by people, there are still things that haven’t been done. “It has been far from just a challenging journey – it’s been a cultural one too.” Ash used the publicity he attracted to highlight conservation projects by organisations including the World Wildle Fund and the Green Development Fund, and he recorded the amount of plastic and pollution he saw along the way.    He said: “The good news is that I’ve seen a huge increase in knowledge and understanding within the communities, towns and cities along the way. “People are aware of the damage being caused to their water sources and are now actively changing their ways for the better. It’s inspiring to see.” To finance his trip, Ash won sponsorship from sunglasses and camera firms and launched his own “AD” range of outdoor wear with Kailas, a Chinese clothing giant.

From refreshing, to sweet, to fruit, there are an endless stream of choices to pick. You might have a favourite or prefer to mix it up - but what could say holiday more than a colourful drink with its own umbrella and straw. And then there are the names - from Long Island Ice Tea, to Mojito, and from a Expresso Martini to an Aperol Spritz - our mouths are watering just at the though. But do you know how your favourite summer tipple got its name  Here are the meanings behind some of the most popular cocktails out there Sex On The Beach    Arguably the most popular holiday cocktail, the Sex on the Beach is a go-to for many - it’s been around for years, and its striking name is enticing enough to get most people to order it. Typically containing vodka and peach schnapps, as well as orange, cranberry andpineapple juice, this summer classic is sweet, fruity anddangerous! Its name apparently came about when a bartender in Florida named Ted Pizio entered a contest sponsored by the distributor of Peach Schnapps - the contest offered prize money to the bar that sold the most of their product. So, on a bit of a whim, Ted came up with as appealing a name as he could - he figured “sex” and “the beach” were the  main reasons that holiday-goers visited the sunny state of Florida. It worked wonders, so he evidently summed up an ideal summer holiday pretty well. Woo Woo    The ‘Woo Woo’ is essentially a more cranberry-ish version of the Sex on the Beach - it contains vodka, peach schnapps and cranberry juice . As famous as the cocktail is for its bizarre name, it’s pretty much unknown where exactly the term ‘Woo Woo’ came from. One theory claims that it was named after the well-known Captain Jimmy “Woo Woo” Harker, based on the coast of Northern Carolina, whose go-to drink was peach schnapps and cranberry juice. Whatever the story behind it, its definitely a fun one to order - especially once you’ve had a few yourself. Long Island Iced Tea    The infamous Long Island Iced Tea is referred to by many as the ‘everything’ cocktail - vodka, gin, white rum, tequila, triple sec and a dash of coke . For a drink that contains so many dferent types of liquor, it’s surprising that its name sounds like a simple, refreshing cold brew. So, who came up with such an innocent name for this not-so-innocent drink  Apparently, a guy named Robert Butt. Much like the Sex on the Beach, this popular cocktail owes its name to a competition - Robert entered a contest where he had to create a new mixed drink that contained Triple sec, while working at a Long Island nightclub. And, supposedly, it just so happened that the drink ended up similar in colour and taste to a classic iced tea. So the name does make sense - an iced-tea-esque drink created in Long Island  a Long Island Iced Tea. Daiquiri    While the classic daiquiri simply consists of rum, citrus juice and sugar, the popular cocktail has gradually evolved into a range of iations - the Hemingway, the Strawberry and the Banana, to name a few. As far as we know, there’s no crazy story behind the name of this one - its often said that the daiquiri owes its name to the popular ’Daiquiri’ beach, near Santiago de Cuba. The cocktail itself was apparently first invented by an American engineer named Jennings Cox - many believe that he created the drink when he ran out of gin at a party, and so instead decided to use a local Cuban rum as his liquor for drinks. Genius. Martini    Another timeless classic that has evolved into its own family of cocktails is the Martini - the original consists of ginand dry vermouth. Some of the most well-known iations include the incredibly popular Pornstar Martini, and, for all the coffee lovers, the Espresso Martini - my personal favourite. In Martinez, Calornia, the locals claim that the drink was invented during the mid-s. It’s believed that when somebody asked for champagne from a local bar, which wasn’t available, the bartender attempted to recreate a similar tasting drink with the ingredients that he did have. Gin, vermouth, and a few dashes of ious other drinks were chucked together and resulted in what was then referred to as the “The Martinez Special”. “The Martinez Special” grew more and more popular as word of the revolutionary drink spread, and eventually it became known as the Martini. However, it is also believed by many that the drink owes its name to the vermouth used within, Martini  Rossi’s, so who knows. Mojito    If you’re into something a little less sweet and with a little more kick, you’ll know that the mojito is the one. Born in Havana, Cuba, the popular drink consists of five staple things: white rum, sugar, lime juice, soda water and mint. While the history of its name is unknown, there are many interesting theories - one claims that it relates to ‘mojo’, a Cuban seasoning made from lime, whereas others claim that it is a derivative of ‘mojadito’, which translates to “a little wet” in Spanish. Arguably the most popular theory claims that it was originally named El Draque, after Sir Francis Drake who went to invade Havana in the s, and ended up having to throw together a mix of ingredients to make something to drink to get by.  His concoction of mint leaves, juices from sugar cane and limes supposedly inspired a cocktail with similar ingredients that grew popular in Cuba shortly after. Aperol Spritz  This simple Italian cocktail only contains Aperol, soda water and prosecco - but the sweetness of the liqueur with the sharper fizz of the soda and prosecco make for a refreshingly bittersweet taste. In , the Italian liqueur “Aperol” was created by the Barbieri brothers, Luigi and Silvio, who wanted to come up with a new, unique aperit. And then, in the s, some genius decided to add soda water - and eventually prosecco - to the mix. So, the cocktail’s name is literally a description of it’s contents: “Aperol” is the Italian aperit, and spritz just refers to a splash of something fizzy - in this case, the soda water. Piña Colada  Another holiday classic! This creamy, tropical blend is the perfect sweet refreshment for a warm day on the beach - it’s really no surprise that it’s one of the most popular summer drinks. The Spanish name literally translates to “strained pineapple”, referring to the freshly pressed and strained pineapple that is used in the drink, along with white rum, coconut cream and a ton of ice. As for the drink itself, the most popular story of its origin dates back to , when a bartender named Ramón “Monchito” Marrero at a Puerto Rican bar was appointed the task of creating a new signature drink that would excite and entice customers. Monchito spent a very intense  months experimenting with dferent iations, eventually ending up with the first Piña Colada. Success! Bloody Mary  This one is known for its sharper kick, complex mix and ability to cure a hangover, apparently. Its made up of vodka, tomato juice, lemon juice, worcestershire sauce, tabasco, and ious other things like celery, salt, pepper - the list goes on. All of which - when stirred - result in the infamous deep-red drink, the Bloody Mary. Again, its origin is unclear, but the most popular story involves a bartender called Fernand Petiot who worked at Harry’s New York Bar in Paris - it is said that he chucked the drink together and served it to someone, who later referred to it as the Bucket of Blood . But its also believed by many that the drink is named after the English monarch Queen Mary Tudor and her notorious nickname “Bloody Mary”.

FBI agents raided Epstein’s private US Virgin Island, dubbed “paedophile island”, yesterday as the sex-trafficking probe continued, despite his apparent suicide, aged , on Saturday. US officials have also vowed to carry on probing Epstein’s ties to the UK amid fears about his offending overseas. And MPs are calling for an investigation into the Duke of York’s relationship with Epstein. Virginia Giuffre claims she was a victim of sex trafficking by Epstein and “loaned” to Prince Andrew for sex three times, which he vehemently denies. Labour MP Jess Phillips, who sits on the Women and Equalities Committee, said: “I think that, of course, the case must be properly investigated.” She said it was especially important as Prince Andrew, , “still appears to have some role as an envoy for the UK government”. He stood down as a trade envoy in  amid criticism of his links with Epstein.     Ms Phillips added: “No one is assuming guilt, but the Epstein case and evidence does mean that we have a duty to undertake a proper investigation. “We are talking about the trafficking of children, this is very serious and authorities should learn from the past in ignoring such allegations.” Labour backbencher and committed Republican Emma Dent Coad said: “Nobody should be above the law andthere is a case to answer then whoever it is should answer it.” Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle said the prince had questions to answer. He said: “He has been accused by a credible witness of keeping her as a sex slave when she was a child. “He is allegedly among many alleged co-conspirators in a child trafficking operation led by Epstein. It was likely that Epstein would have claried who  was involved and now his victims will never know. “Prince Andrew must give a full account of his relationship with Epstein and answer accusations levelled against him.” US investigators who looked at Epstein’s “little black book” found almost half of it read like a who’s who of British society. His  British contacts had more than , numbers and dozens of email addresses between them.    There is no suggestion the presence of their names in the book means any are accused of any wrongdoing or even met Epstein in person. The contacts included celebrities such as Mick Jagger, Simon Le Bon, the late Sir David Frost, Richard Branson, Naomi Campbell, Tamara Beckwith, Jonathan Dimbleby, Loyd Grossman and numerous lords and ladies.Former Prime Minister Tony Blair is recorded once, while his former cabinet minister Lord Peter Mandelson has  numbers, including one marked “direct line” one for “home” and another for “country home”.There are  numbers for Prince Andrew, including a mobile number, one marked “Palace ex-directory”, one for Balmoral, the Queen’s Scottish residence, where the Prince invited Epstein, and one marked “Sand”, for Sandringham, another royal retreat where he spent time. Epstein also recorded  numbers for Prince Andrew’s former we Sarah Ferguson, who took £, off the paedophile to help pay off her debts.    Federal prosecutors and FBI agents who built the case against Epstein have turned their attention to people his accusers claim were involved in his scheme to sexually exploit dozens of underage girls. It includes a circle of associates who victims claim helped recruit, train and coerce them. One document is said to describe in detail the “damning things” Epstein’s inner circle did as he abused more than  girls from across the world. A source said: “The document entails everybody in the Epstein case. It has some damning things, including about a number of Brits.” The ex-Wall Street financier flew “sex slave” Giuffre, formerly known as Roberts, to London in , when she was just . While in the capital, she was pictured with the then -year-old Prince Andrew inside the home of British socialite ­Ghislaine Maxwell. Giuffre claims she was “lent out” to the prince for sex in London and on two other occasions. Buckingham Palace has issued an “emphatic” denial, saying: “Any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue. “It is emphatically denied that the Duke had any form of sexual contact or relationship with [then] Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is  and without foundation.”  US Attorney General William Barr said yesterday that there were “serious irregularities” at the federal prison in New York City where Epstein died. And he vowed that the investigation into Epstein’s sex crimes would continue. Barr, the top US law enforcement official, said: “Any co-conspirators should not rest easy.” His comments came in a speech to the Grand Lodge Fraternal Order of Police’s National Biennial Conference. Barr said the criminal case against Epstein was personally important to him. He said the financier’s death had denied victims the chance to confront Epstein in a courtroom. Barr said: “I was appalled – and indeed the whole department was – and frankly angry to learn of the politan Correctional Center’s failure to adequately secure this prisoner. “We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a ­thorough investigation.” The decision by officials at the Bureau of Prisons not to keep Epstein on suicide watch even after he was found semi-conscious with neck wounds in July has come under scrutiny. The prison where Epstein died is run by the federal Bureau of Prisons, a ision of the US Justice Department.

Khalid Qadeer, who works as a tax adviser in London, is a frequent customer at the food chain and would always opt for its signature tuna baguette sandwich. However, the tax adviser was shocked to find out the sandwich contained white wine vinegar, after noticing the ingredient listed on a new printed label. White wine vinegar is not considered halal in Islam. Despite that, the ingredient is also not listed on fridge labels in store. Pret has come under fire in recent months over the deaths of two customers who suffered allergic reactions from consuming the restaurantaposs food.    They have since placed new labels containing a full list of ingredients on all Pret food products - and Mr Qadeer has slammed Pret for failing to mention white wine vinegar as a listed ingredient until now. Mr Qadeer said white wine vinegar is like a nut allergy for many Muslims as they have zero tolerance towards it. He told : Being a Muslim I can’t consume anything with alcohol. And there’s probably thousands of Muslims who buy products from Pret. As most people know, some Muslims drink alcohol and the rest, but there is a certain percentage that will have a “oh what the f***” moment here. He added: I’ve worked in the City for the last  years as a tax adviser and I would have never bought the product had I known. Mr Qadeer complained to his local Pret store manager and his case was later escalated to Pret’s CEO, Clive Schlee. In an email seen by , the CEO said his technicians have been calculating the alcohol content of the white wine vinegar in the tuna mayo baguette.

George Hobbs was placed on the list for urgent surgery after a specialist finally diagnosed the black horn-like growth was actually skin cancer - that had been sprouting out of the top of his head for nine months. The -year-old was taken to hospital after a nasty fall on the day of his weaposs funeral last August, but when the cut on his head was healing, the huge growth developed. George ignored the swelling lump until February, when the pain became so much he went to his GP, who sent him home with paracetamol, despite having a black, egg-sized lump on his scalp.    The retired civil servantaposs GP surgery sent him home with painkillers three times before he was finally referred to a hospital. He died on July  and his grieving daughter Clare Hobbs, , now wants to know why he was never prescribed medication and why it took medics so long to help her father. She said: There have been failures on a lot of peopleaposs parts. Towards the end heaposd spend a lot of time lying down as thataposs when it was at its least painful. He hardly went out because he was embarrassed. He filed all his documents and when I went through them after his death I found a note which read aposplease help me itaposs so painfulapos. That was heartbreaking. I just want someone to take responsibility. He was miserable and he did not deserve that. In May, George, from Gillingham, Kent, said he went to his local doctors, twice before he was sent to a specialist. He said: I saw a dferent doctor the second time and they took one look at it and told me it was too bad for them to deal with. The next I knew I had a call from the plastic surgery department at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead.    He slipped in his daughteraposs bathroom last August and cut his head open, and after patching him up, doctors sent him home. The wound gradually grew in size, and when he eventually went to the doctor it was the size of an egg and growing. After the doctor sent him home with painkillers, he said, he tried to deal with it as best he could, but the lump kept getting larger and more painful. He claimed the advice was repeated at two further visits until a new doctor sent him to see dermatology experts at the Community Living Health Centre in Gillingham, who referred him to Queen Victoria Hospital. The hospital arranged for Mr Hobbs to see a specialist during a weekly visit to Medway Maritime Hospital. The grandfather-of-three said he was later told by a specialist that he urgently needed to go under the kne. Earlier this year, he said: Iaposm furious that they didnapost take this seriously to start with. Itaposs really causing me a lot of discomfort. The specialist at Medway told me I should never have been told to take paracetamol for it. They were amazed it had been allowed to get this bad and said I should have been sent to them immediately. George, who had also been recovering from bladder cancer, was worried about going under the kne again.

The future Princess Diana was just  when her future husband invited her to Windsor Castle to ask her a question that would change her le forever.When she arrived he said: Iaposve missed you so much, before taking her to the castleaposs homely nursery. But his proposal wasnapost exactly the most romantic gesture, and what he did immediately afterwards was far from a special moment with his bride-to-be. Speaking in a Channel  documentary Charles and Di: The Truth Behind Their wedding, royal expert Ingrid Seward says Diana actually started laughing when he asked the question.    She said: She burst out laughing, I think that was probably her nerves. She didnapost think it was the most romantic of proposals but she had the proposal. Royal biographer Christopher Wilson added: She was completely bowled over by this, didnapost see it coming. In a later interview Diana revealed further details about the proposal. She said: He said do you realise that one day youaposll be Queen. And I said aposI love you so much, I love you so muchapos.    He said aposwhatever loves meansapos. He said it then. So I thought, that was great. I thought he meant it.

Mr Wilson said: He didnapost pick her up in her arms and embrace or do any of the things we might do when we propose marriage to the one that we love.

Their questions had to be pre-approved and they were warned not to stray from the script, and Charles and Diana came across as a couple very much in love and looking forward to their wedding. But looking back with hindsight, there was one moment of the interview which revealed the heartbreaking reality.  Angela watched the interview back in full for the first time for the documentary. She said: With the knowledge of hindsight you read so much more into body language, what was said, looks that were given, reactions. Thataposs the value of hindsight isnapost it.

Jack, nine, lost his father Robbie Fleming when he was found dead at his home in Lisburn, Northern Ireland after suffering with depression. Robbie, just  when he died, was a huge Liverpool FC fan and dreamed of taking Jack to meet their hero Steven Gerrard. Speaking before they met Gerrard, Jackaposs mum Alison said: Robbie and Jack were desperate to meet Steven Gerard, but never got to meet him. It would give me a bit of comfort to know that he knows how much Robbie loved him. Now, a year on from his fatheraposs tragic death, Jack finally got to meet Gerrard who arranged an afternoon out with him in Liverpool. Flying out from Belfast, the family-of-six arrived in the city for a three-day adventure ready to meet the man himself, reports the Liverpool Echo.    The family were taken by a private chauffeur to meet the Reds legend. Originally, they were meant to meet at Formby Hall Golf Resort  Spa, but due to a road traffic collision, they switched venues - ending up in a local Starbucks. Alison said: There was not a person there, it was just us. I think he must have phoned up beforehand to ask for the privacy. During the -minute meeting, Gerrard offered to buy the family whatever they wanted to eat and drink. He also signed a number of pieces including Jackaposs Build-A-Bear named after his dad, football shirts and an autograph which will be added to Vernonaposs tattoo in tribute to his son. Alison said: I first saw him coming through the door and Jackaposs face we will never forget it - it was priceless.

Alison said: It was a bit of a bittersweet moment, as all me and my husband could think of was how happy Robbie would have been to meet him. I got very emotional and tried to hold back my tears, but unfortunately I was unable to. Gerrard gave the family six tickets to Liverpoolaposs first Premier League game of the season at Anfield. The night saw the Redsapos beat Norwich City -, with Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Divock Origi scoring.

But step inside this th century tower and itaposs a totally dferent story. Martello Tower Y, tucked away on a quiet stretch of Sussex coastline, was built for a Napoleonic invasion that never came. It was meant to repel the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and as such dates back to the early th century. But a complete refurbishment in  has seen the property scoop a number of architectural and design awards, with English Heritage labelling the renovation as “exemplary”.    It has been described as one of the most original and soul-stirring modern homes in Britain - and it could be yours for a cool £.million. The three-bedroom home has a completely re-sculpted interior which perfectly blends period features with modern, contemporary architecture. It even has a modern-day drawbridge as well as a wrap-around roof terrace so buyers can take in that stunning seaside view, which is classed as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Inside, there are two elegant spiral staircases and a rustic, cosy atmosphere by the log-burner. Each of the three bedrooms fits between the inner funnel wall and outer curved wall, while lightwells and skylights are found throughout the property.    The roof extension, in the words of designer Duncan Jackson, “echoes the sculptural interior of vaulted brickwork creating a congruency between the contemporary and historic”. During its former le, the tower would have been shared by troops and coastguards in cramped, living quarters, with plenty of gunpowder and cannonballs for company. It was decommissioned in the s. Rightmove’s property expert Miles Shipside said: “This strikingly unique tower is one of the finest conversion projects I have ever seen.    It beautully combines its rich history and modern finishes with effortless charm. The innovation is second to none and I am hugely impressed by how sensitively the collaborators have dealt with the property. It’s a real gem.” There is a climb up a metal staircase to the first floor to get into the unusual home and there is a wood burning stive to cosy up next to in the living room. On the second floor is kitchen living dining area, which opens out onto the stunning terrace. The three bedrooms, two study spaces and two bathrooms are all on the ground floor.

Lydia, who happens to be the owner of Oakwood Dog Grooming, gave her dog bright-pink feet and a matching tail with magenta hair dye. Moments after posting an image of her handiwork online, the heated backlash started, with Lydia being labelled as cruel and selfish.    Lydia said: A lot of people have said I dyed her for attention, but even without her coloured bits she was already a pretty unusual looking dog.

The criticism also included accusations that using dye on dogs is in fact dangerous for them, with one person fuming: It is medically proven that there are no  per cent safe dyes for animals. Chemicals found in hair colour such as hydrogen peroxide and ammonia, are very strong chemicals that can cause allergic reactions in dogs. Hair colouring is a human fad and pets such as cats and dogs should be kept outside this ambit    Being a dog-groomer, though, Lydia insists that this is not the case with the dye she carefully selected, which was semi-permanent, vegan and dog-friendly Addressing the accusations of abuse, a salon spokesperson said: How on earth is it abuse  Eggz couldnapost care less what colour she is, and the dye contains less nasties than most leading pet brands.  Abuse is not brushing your dog so it gets so knotty itaposs painful, not walking your dog so it gets so fat it dies young from the strain on its body. Abuse is not feeding your dog or giving it water or love.

Europa League third qualying round lead from last week’s first leg.A miserable result on the Continent was compounded for NAC Breda loanee Leigh and his team-mates when they suffered a - Premiership reverse to St Mirren in soaking Paisley on Sunday.Nevertheless, the -year-old is convinced the Dons know what they need to do to fight their way to the Euro play-off round and keep their hopes of the lucrative group stages alive.He said: “Everybody who plays in these big competitions comes up against this at some point.“We’ve obviously come up against it really early.“We’re a strong group. Sunday was annoying, but we’ll get back stronger, kick on to Thursday and show what we can do.”Englishman Leigh pointed to May’s Anfield stunner when Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool overturned Barca’s - first leg lead with a - victory to reach the pinnacle of the European game.He said: “People wrote off Liverpool against Barca. But it’s a strong position to know what you have to do before you go into the game.“For example, a -, - scoreline is dficult for everybody, because you think, do we press  Do we sit off  Do we defend “But we know we need to score as many goals as possible – at least two – and not concede.“That’s a game plan we can go with and say ‘this is how we’re going to play to do that’.“It’s obviously a worry, but we just need to go out and do it.”Away in Rijeka, and at the Simple Digital Arena, Derek McInnes’ Dons have struggled to put the intricate attacking puzzle together.In Croatia, they kept the game goalless to half-time.However, against Jim Goodwin’s well-organised Saints, they were suckered after  minutes by Ilkay Durmus’ goal on the counter.One thing’s for sure, they need to come flying out of the traps at Pittodrie and find the flair they did in the - home victory over Georgians Chikhura Sachkhere.Leigh said: “No, we can’t . It’s something the manager has addressed after the game and that the players are aware of.“We know what we have to do as early as possible to give ourselves a chance.“Going away to a place like Rijeka, we didn’t show what we were about.“In the first game, we were obviously going in thinking not conceding was the ideal scenario.“But we know we have to show them what we’re about at Pittodrie, we’ve done that so farand we’ve got to do it again.”One problem on the horizon is the potential absence of Sam Cosgrove for the crunch meeting with Rijeka, as the hitman has a hamstring problem.Curtis Main was unable to fill Cosgrove’s sizeable boots in Paisley, but Leigh thinks inidual absences can’t be allowed to derail the team.Squad players like Scott Wright, Connor McLennan and new signing Zak Vyner were also below their best against Saints.Leigh said: “We need to be able to play without certain players. With injuries, suspensions, it happens.“With players coming into the team who haven’t had games, it maybe showed that they were a little rusty, but they can improve.“They’re good players, they’ve potential.“Heis important, but we have to be able to work without him as well.”The Eurpean qualying campaign has meant a hectic early season for McInnes’ squad, but it’s one of the reasons Leigh opted to move to the Granite City, so he won’t complain about the privilege.He added: “In a sense, it’s tough , but as players it’s exactly what you want to be doing.“You want to be playing in as many competitions and playing as much as possible. You need the mental side of things as well, but as players it’s what we train for.“We’re in every day to work hard and treat it like a game.

This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

We challenged the soccer centre to increase the number of children participating and ask how far and often they could let the young players experience events and festivals where and I am delighted they were able to match our ambitions. For that reason and for the second year running we are providing £, of funding. We know our funding last season allowed well over  young players to receive new strips in the Red Star design and attend events across the UK and we look forward to watching their developments over the next season.#Ben Tustin of the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre was equally delighted and said that the Ardrishaig Community Trust #is an excellent partner for us without which we would not have been able to deliver many of our strategic objectives. We are wholly dependent on external funding and volunteers and we do receive generous funding from other organisations as well as the Trust.

Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"mach1 scottish tarmack rally championship report","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith  starters and  Cobble shop STRC registered the championship tables were always going to change on this mid-season two day event.Sunshine was forecast for the Machrihanish Airbase Community Companycourse and that’s what was delivered. Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing. With navigator Ian McCulloch, his biggest problems were brake related but with some fluid changes and adjustments it was just all back to normal for the team finishing a well-deserved th overall and fourth in class.Kayleigh Strachan in the Citroen Saxo finished th in class on the event and th overall but managed to pick up  points and th in class in the STRC.Gary Coutts in the Fiesta commented after the final stage on the Sunday that on the second to last stage of day one he developed a few ‘minor’ issues. A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall. A great result for the team with no damage or mechanical issues to report.Class  had four teams registered in the STRC this year at Mach  but only one managed to finish.

Goddards were granted permission to turn the house into a wedding venue with marquees in July , but Scottish Borders Council imposed strict conditions on the use after receiving strong objections from neighbours.One condition, that the planning permission was only valid for two years, was removed on appeal but the condition that only two rooms can be rented out in the mansion at a time has remained in place.The most recent application, submitted by Lanark-based Burrel Design Studios on behalf of the Goddards, seeks to lt this condition and allow guests to stay in the mansions year-round.A supporting statement accompanying the application reads: ldquoThe effect of the councilrsquos ruling means that year-round self-catering accommodation may legitimately be offered in the lodge, the white house and penthouse, and the rights bestowed under the planning acts mean that year-round bed and breakfast accommodation may be offered for a maximum of two bedrooms within Hartree

the historic structure from being a building lsquoat riskrsquo to being a fully restored historic building incorporating some contemporary elements, which have served to reconcile former unsympathetic earlier additions and have made the building fit for occupation in the current age.ldquoRegrettably, the limitations imposed by the planning status of the property at Hartree have restricted the opportunity for the current owners to accommodate visitors who have wished to re-establish their connection with Hartree House.ldquoThe opportunity to offer accommodation in Hartree House to guests will add signicantly to the attraction of Hartree as a venue and will assist towards the upkeep of the house and grounds.A castle, known as Hartree Tower, was present on the site by at least the th

Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace.

at Barrel Law, near Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms

The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here.

are fortunate in Scotland to have a way out of such dficulties in the form of a Debt Arrangement Scheme , which is one of Scotland’s best-kept secrets.  It’s available from charitable organisations such as StepChange and from commercial debt advisers such as TC Debt Solutions, too.  It is a Scottish Government scheme that is legally binding and prevents creditors from taking further action against people who owe money.Set up back in  by the Scottish Government, the scheme allows people to freeze interest and charges on their debts and pay their debts off interest-free over a longer period of time.  This brings payments down to levels that people can afford and gives people the chance to get their lives back on track.  Interest and charges are simply written off.Apart from reducing debt, one of the best things about the DAS scheme is that it protects people from their creditors but is not a form of insolvency: people get to pay back their debt in an affordable way.  Lenders like the scheme because they know they will eventually get their money back – and borrowers like it because they don’t have to pay interest charges and they get longer to pay their debts off.  It’s a case of everyone wins.There’s plenty of information about the Debt Arrangement Scheme online at  www.aib.gov.uk debt-arrangement-scheme.  Thousands of people have used the scheme, but so many

summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots

It is an intimate world, personal and subjective, the world of our thoughts and feelings. Children live in it quite naturally, but as adults we tend to withdraw from it.#I use high-key expressionist colour to express how I feel about the landscape.#I’ve been painting the area around me now for over  years, and the more I paint Knapdale, the more intensely I use light and colour to express my emotions for the landscape.#John worked for  years as an art teacher at Lochgilphead High School, then in art education with Strathclyde Region before leaving work to paint full-time in .His distinctive colourful landscapes quickly made him one of the Scotland’s most successful painters, with celebrities such as Sting, Madonna, Simon Le Bon and Gregor Fisher collecting his work.Wilma Meikle, who owns the Archway Gallery with her husband Iain, said: #We’re delighted that John has supported the gallery for all these years.

McDonnells Edinburgh Declaration caught the Scottish political world completely by surprise. The SNP couldnt believe their ears. I initially thought his remarks, especially the reference to ldquothe English Parliament, were just a badly-briefed UK politician talking off the cuff. But no. It is now apparently UK Labour policy to accept the SNPrsquos call for ldquoindyref. Gobs were well and truly smacked.Most smacked of all were the Scottish Labour Partys. Their leader, Richard Leonard, was left speechless. The Shadow Chancellor had directly contradicted Labours  manesto promise to oppose a repeat referendum. Only in March, Leonard made clear in an interview with the Daily Record, that a future Labour government would, like Theresa May, refuse any request for a ldquoSection  Order to trigger a legally-binding referendum on independence. No s no buts.:Scottish Labour registers lowest level of income in nearly two decadesNot any more, it seems. The Branch Office, as the SNP like to call Scottish Labour, has been told to back the policy of their deadly enemy. Christmas has come early for Nicola Sturgeon, without the turkeys.Many Scottish Labour MSPs were incandescent, as was the former Labour shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray MP, who called McDonnell ldquoludicrous and demanded that he ldquoapologise to Richard Leonard , and reaffirm Labours policy of opposition to a referendum . Off-the-record comments from Scottish Labour figures were unprintable. Unionist Labour MSPs put together a statement ldquodeploring\" the change in policy. This backfired when it emerged they hadnt cleared it with Richard Leonards office.The Labour MP, Paul Sweeney, then added to the confusion by calling for a multi-option referendum including federalism, or devo max as it used to be called. This was once proposed by Alex Salmond in , and rejected by Labour and the Conservatives in favour of a binary Yes No question. Saying Labour were all over the place would be an insult to geography.So, what on earth is going on  Why was one of the key figures in the UK Labour party provoking a split on one of the most contentious issues in British politics  And right in the middle of the Brexit row. Labour is now ided every which way on the constitution: over Scottish independence and over leaving Europe. McDonnell has left the Scottish party an impossible task: trying to win Scottish votes without a policy on Scotland in a general election thats possibly weeks away.:Scottish Labour breaks silence over anti-semitism investigation by blasting \"biased\" BBCWhat seems to have happened is this. Labour, at a UK level, has started to think about forming much wider political alliances in future in order to defeat the rising tide of the right. This has been discussed by a number of Labour people, including the former BBC economics editor Paul Mason in his book Clear Bright Future.Mason has argues that Labour should abandon its traditional base in the white working class and the trades union movement, and look to creating a new progressive alliance, or ldquopopular front, with LGBT and BAME groups, and with other progressive political parties. Mason regards the SNP, unlike most other nationalist parties, as progressive and social democratic. On the eve of McDonnells Edinburgh interview Mason called infor ldquoa penalty-free independence referendum whenever Holyrood chooses.Im not saying that Paul Mason is writing Labour policy. Far from it. Many in the party regard him with suspicion, not least for appearing to abandon the working class. But it looks asthe Labour leadership has finally been persuaded that the SNP is not just a band of ldquotartan Tories, and that Jeremy Corbyn could do business with Nicola Sturgeon.Scottish Labour is anyway likely to be crushed again in the forthcoming General Wlection, while the SNP is in line for around  Westminster seats according to the polls. Its support would almost certainly be requiredLabour is to try to form a government, and McDonnells intervention could be an attempt to prepare the ground. Theres been no love lost between Corbyn and the mostly Blairite rump of the Scottish Labour Party, so he probably regards them as expendable.Not that Labour is admitting any of this. Indeed, the line from McDonnell in Edinburgh, echoed by the Shadow Business Secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey on Newsnight, is that Labour will not form any ldquocoalitions or pacts with anyone. Labour is still smarting from those Tory election posters in  which showed the then leader, Ed Miliband, in Alex Salmonds breast pocket. It is imperative for Labour, in England at least, to deny any hint of an alliance with the SNP.But Scotland is a dferent. A ing Labour government in Westminster would require the tacit assistance of the SNP, perhaps on a confidence and supply basis. At any rate, the UK party leadership seems to have decided that offering a referendum is a risk worth taking to help some future co-operation to happen. This is huge development and raises questions about whether Labour can still be called a Unionist party.Paul Hutcheon: the biggest threat to the Union is Scottish Labours disintegrationLast week felt asa dam has broken. After three years in which Scottish politics has been in suspended animation, suddenly everyone was talking about independence again. Even Conservative commentators like The Times Iain Martin are now calling for a referendum in five years. s Simon Jenkins believes independence itself is now unavoidable, and called on Westminster to plan for it now.Of course, a referendum may not deliver a Yes. The polls still show Scotland split down the middle on independence. But this is a vindication of Nicola Sturgeons cautious, constitutional approach to winning independence. It is a blow to her critics, who had been calling for an unauthorised referendum, or even UDI. The former SNP MP, George Kerevan, had been calling for mass civil disobedience to obstruct London transport. But this is a blow her internal critics will be happy to take for there is now a real possibility of a referendum in the next couple of years.That isLabour manages to defeat Boris Johnson ndash a big ask, perhaps, but far from impossible. There will likely be a vote of no confidence the Tory PM next month, and he will almost certainly lose. If Labour fails to form an alternative government in  days, then Johnson has to call a General Election. Hes hoping to delay polling day until after Brexit on October . But that is a risky tactic. Such constitutional jiggery pokery could easily alienate voters, many of whom are anyway unconvinced by Johnsons abilities.Just about anything could happen in the next few weeks. But what is not in doubt is that Scottish independence, or at least a referendum, is back on the agenda. And almost exactly five years since the last one."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed-uk-shoppers-want-39-perfect-39-community-high-street","story":"In a land of strip malls, edge-of-town supermarkets and soulless retail parks, shoppers still dream of traditional mom and pop stores.A survey , adults has found a real community shopping street should have baker, a butcher, a barber, post office, and hardware store.And even in an era of downloads, those surveyed said they would want a record shop.So we all know want makes the perfect high street.

There they would live in simple huts, shielings, making butter and cheese, with the younger generation learning about themselves and their heritage from the elders.:Climate change warnings for Victorian infrastructureIt is exactly that spirit of community and transmission of customs that Dr Harrison and partner Karen Marshall, who runs the projectrsquos outdoor nursery, are working so hard to maintain.The Shieling Project was dreamed up  years ago when Dr Harrison, who at the time was a nomadic educator, travelling from school to school, was helping children paint a ldquopicture of the richness of where they lived.He dreamed of having a permanent site where he could rear livestock and teach people the value of working with, and for, nature. It was during the study of his PhD in Place Based Education that the idea began to crystallise.He said: ldquoI was thinking about the shieling as a way of educating kids because thatrsquos how they learned about the wider natural landscape. In the old days, they went up to the shieling, they found about all the place names and all the plants and animals out there.ldquoI loved the idea of kids being in the outdoors, running around the hills, learning about them, looking after the cows, fending off the wolves, singing all the songs around the fireplace.ldquoEventually, I just kind got to a stage where I had no choice but to start.Six years on and the project now has  employees who welcome school and private groups to pitch in while learning lost skills.The project represents the value of how communities used to live. Dr Harrison said: ldquoItrsquos a reminder that we managed to live for a very long time in a sustainable way. There were more people living off the land who were self sufficient.Careful not to romanticise what would have been a hard le, Dr Harrison believes modern societies would only benefit from reconnecting with the wild.He said: ldquoI think nowadays when we think about environmental issues, we just think humans are bad but the Shieling is giving children a story that people arenrsquot inherently bad but were part of a healthy eco-system.ldquoThe Shieling is a little tradition that has got a big message about what wersquore struggling with today about sustainable communities.Children, young people and adults come to the project to learn how to tend to animals, grow food, cook and turn off their devices to collaboratively create a culture for themselves through songs, storytelling and film.Guests help construct low carbon buildings and monitor the energy they are using while on site.:Skip meat twice a week to help save the planet, say climate change expertsDr Harrison said: ldquoTypically environmental education has been disaster education. How rubbish everything is, attempting to motivate change by guilt and shame. Here, and especially for children, we think that a stronger motivation is love, enjoyment, care for a place.ldquoHere we let people experience a bit of off grid living and be outside for long periods of time. All this adds up to skills for a sustainable future, but it also adds up to fun, to a sense of mental and physical well-being.Dr Harrison hopes that visitors might then see any changes they need to make to adapt to and mitigate climate change as positive.He said: ldquoIn terms of educating children like this, the idea is that we try and use practical experiences so wersquore getting peoplersquos bodies and minds engaged, because most of schooling is either sitting being told stuff or is virtual and itrsquos not engaging peoplersquos bodies and hearts, as well as their minds.It is during the practical experiences of making a basket or digging up peat or feeding calves where young people can think through the ideas they are being taught and ldquolive through some of the big questions being asked.Dr Harrison said: ldquoYou canrsquot ask a child what a stable future looks like and expect an answer in a minute. They need weeks or years or lives to think about that. And they also need to experience it, rather than just have it as an abstract thing, because thatrsquos the problem with all these big things like climate change, sustainability, and bioersity, theyrsquore so huge. How do you get hold of it  How do you understand it  How do you make it real in a way that you can hold on to and do something about it ldquoOtherwise, itrsquos just like, lsquooh, Irsquom scared about thatrsquo, because itrsquos just an idea.The untraditional gender politics of the historical shielings is another teaching arm of Dr Harrisonrsquos programme. While the men remained in the low lands with the burgeoning crops, the women took the cattle, and therefore all the wealth, up to graze.He said: ldquoThat alone was fairly unusual in some of these traditional cultures where the men tend to be fairly entrenched in their power positions.Children are ldquowonderfully resilient, and flexible and open to new ideas but are not able to make the choices about how they live and what they do.Dr Harrison said: ldquoWhat wersquore trying to do is show that sustainability is a way of being happier and healthier and having fun.ldquoWe want them to see that we can build up build some of our buildings, we can grow some of our food, we can take our entertainment, art, and cultural experience back into our own control and do it ourselves. We can actually have a feeling that wersquore involved in our landscape and our community.The beauty of the project is that it looks both backwards and forwards to inform its teachings.Dr Harrison said: ldquoWersquore asking what the future is going to look like, and what does that mean to you."},{"url":null,"title":"safety-alert-brake-issues-blamed-caledonian-sleeper-emergency","story":"The Rail Accident Investigation Branch raised their concerns over brake failure while launching an investigation into how the Lowland Sleeper sparked an emergency at Edinburgh Waverley station.The RAIB said the train eventually came to a halt, but over  yards beyond its intended stopping point.While there was no damage or any injuries as a result of the incident the RAIB said the outcome could \"potentially have been worse, had it led to a collision with another train\".:Brake issues to Caledonian Sleeper caused emergency at Edinburgh WaverleyInvestigators say that on the approach to Edinburgh at .am on August , the driver discovered that the trains braking performance was \"well below normal\" and it \"failed to stop as scheduled\".An RAIB preliminary investigation indicated that he had no control of the brakes on the coaches because a brake pipe isolating valve was in the closed position when the train left Carstairs station.The RAIB said this meant that the only effective brakes on the train as it approached Edinburgh were those on the locomotive, which were \"insufficient to maintain control of the train\".Now it has emerged the Sleepertrain operator Serco issued a safety alertto the industry in relation to the incident, four days later.The RAIB said the reminded railway staff of the importance of \"carrying out a brake continuity test after all other train preparation activities\".Neither the RAIB, Serco or the Rail Safety and Standards Board would allow sight of the alert.:Investigation underway after Caledonian Sleeper overshot  at Edinburgh WaverleyThe train was eventually brought to a stand still by the operation of an emergency device in one of the coaches by the train manager, which caused the train brakes to apply.The incident meant services to London, Dunbar, North Berwick and Tweedbank were cancelled or delayed, before the train was pushed back to the .The Caledonian Sleeper has suffered a number of setbacks since it relaunched with a new poundm fleet in April.

Finlay gave an address to the Smile For Future meeting, which was attended by about  people from  countries, including Swedish climate activist Ms Thunberg.The three main demands include ldquoclimate justice, increased awareness of the results of scientic research on climate change as well as keeping global warming limited to .C compared with pre-industrial levels.But Finlayrsquos fame went ahead of him. ldquoGreta said lsquoyoursquore Finlay from Ullapoolrsquo, said the boyrsquos father, Geoff. ldquoThey spoke about the environment and Finlay thanked her for inspiring all the young climate activists around the world.Ms Thunberg recently became the first person to receive a GQ Men Of The Year award, which was specically created to celebrate her work on the global climate crisis.The -year-old is on the cover of the latest issue of GQ ahead of formally being crowned the magazinersquos Game Changer Of The Year next month.Ms Thunberg spearheaded school strikes for climate change, encouraging students across the world to skip classes and call for action from world leaders. GQ magazine editor Dylan Jones hailed her ldquofearless dedication to raising awareness of the global climate change crisis.The teenager, who will receive the award via a video link, said: ldquoI am very grateful and this award is for everyone in the Fridays For Future movement, everyone whose school is striking for the climate.ldquoWe all deserve this award because together we have accomplished so much. So thank you to everyone who has been school striking as well.Ms Thunberg, who is taking a year off school to raise awareness of climate change, is set to attend the UN climate summit in New York next month, travelling by racing yacht and avoiding planes, as well as polluting cruise ships.But Finlay is fast developing his own fan following. Television wildle presenter Chris Packham described him as ldquoinspirational after an online row with Grylls saw him trolled online. The BBC Springwatch host hailed Finlay a hero for standing up to the intimidation, and even invited the youngster to share a stage with him.ldquoI donrsquot think it is right to put sharks in tanks and make money from it, Finlay told the BBC at the time. ldquoAs chief scout I thought it set a very bad example to children on how we should treat animals.The -year-old has spent part of his year on a mini-world tour. In June he travelled to Vancouver, Canada, on an international organisation-sponsored scholarship to attend the Ocean Heroes Bootcamp. The three-day event trains young people to be global ambassadors for fighting plastic pollution.On histo the UK, Finlay went to Sheffield for the Childrenrsquos Media Conference  after being selected as one of  ldquochange makers.His presentation was on sharks, plastics and climate change and how the media can help educate and spread positive message to young people.Earlier this month Finlay was also on a youth  at Birdfair, Rutland Water, near Leicester, with other young wildle campaigners answering questions from the audience on subject of wildlersquos future and the impact of climate change.His mother Rachel said: ldquoWe are very proud of Finlay ndash he is so passionate about trying to persuade people to make a dference to the planet.ldquoHe also learns a lot talking about subjects like plastic pollution in the sea and sharks.ldquoHe made a New Yearrsquos resolution to become vegetarian for the sake of the planet ndash which he has kept to ndash and is now thinking of going vegan.

It may be the low quality of our petty, patronising political discourse at Scottish, UK and EU level. Or it may be the cringe I feel when I hear that the NHS or the education system or whatever  is the ldquoenvy of the world, with all available evidence suggesting the contrary.Either way, Irsquom not exercised by national identity. My political decisions are made clinically. I am emotionally cold to political parties and to the sides of a referendum campaign. I cast my vote based purely on the perceived risk and reward for me and my family.:UK first in line for trade deal post Brexit, insists US security chief John BoltonAll of this is to make clear that, whilst I may not win a Patriot of the Year award, I am not uncomfortable with the theory of living in an independent Scotland. But in rsquos independence referendum my risk reward matrix led me to vote No. In truth, it was not a dficult choice. I have never doubted the long-term viability of an independent Scotland, but in the short-term I saw a fiscal hole with a policy  which would have made it bigger, not smaller. Too much risk, not enough reward.My choice was not an unusual one it is generally accepted through subsequent polling that uncertainty over the economic case was the central inhibitor to pushing the Yes campaign over the  per cent line.The prospect of a second independence referendum is now real. The  Scottish election is the most important in devolutionrsquos short history. The campaign will be, as good as, single-issue: should there or should there not be another referendum  If the pro-independence partiesa Holyrood majority, based on a clear, unambiguous and identical manesto pledge, then indyref  is in my view a democratic requirement. This is, effectively, the point acknowledged by both John McDonnell and David Mundell last week.How could Yes win  First, it could double-down on the - ldquocampaign ndash tack to the left, promote populist economics, arrange a big march, wave some Palestinian flags, Bairns Not Bombs, End London Rule and all the rest.Perhaps we are in an era where this can work. The recent record of prevailing economic theory winning political arguments is murky. The Yes campaign in  almost won despite the economic orthodoxy running contrary, as did Jeremy Corbyn in , and in , of course, the Leave campaign proved that relentless economic warnings can be ignored by a majority of the population.However this ndash a win based on a socialist fairytale ndash is no way to create a new country. We can damn private enterprise, wealth creators and taxpayers, but without them wersquoll find ourselves at the bottom of a social and economic pit in short order. This is student union politics, and high school economics. Eventhey could win this way, they shouldnrsquot.I spend most days with the Scottish business community. Their world is ruled by risk. And although, of course, this ies industry-to-industry, they generally see three primary political risks affecting their business. The first, and most concerning for them, is a Corbyn-led Labour government, the second is Scottish independence and the third is Brexit. Yes campaigners may wish that this order was radically altered, but that is the reality on the ground.:Mark Smith: How a Wings Over Scotland party could turn Yes to NoMost people in business ndash generally Remainers, generally No voters ndash are miles away from voting Yes, and every time they see the marchers and their flags and their populism on a Saturday afternoon, they move still further. They want to see some adults in the room.It is not as though the SNP doesnrsquot understand this. Andrew Wilsonrsquos Growth Commission was an effort to reassure this key demographic. And it was a very good one, primarily, in my view, because it acknowledged the economic reality of a small country in a big world, and did not bow to populism .But the Wilson report is one of very few items on that side of the balancing scale, still sitting high in the air, weighed down by the cacophony of evidence that the economic argument has not evolved.The SNP needs a long runway to prove that an independent Scotland can be an economic success story. There are a couple of obvious hurdles along the way. The first will come later this year, with the Scottish Governmentrsquos annual Budget. Since the  election ed a minority government, the SNP has relied on Green support for three budgets in a row. Each one has involved further concessions each one has pulled the SNP further left, particularly on tax. Not a lot just a little each time. The  budget will do the same.With the backdrop of a Boris Johnson government which might lower personal taxes in England, an expanding gap between Scottish and English taxpayers will really start to bite. Scots donrsquot like paying taxes any more than anyone  attempts to argue the contrary are delusional.The second hurdle is,anything, more dficult to tackle. Over the coming weeks, Westminster mathematics may present the SNP with an opportunity to replace Boris Johnson with Jeremy Corbyn infor a second independence referendum. This will be tempting. Indeed, it will likely be impossible to resist, and I am not suggesting that it should be.:Marianne Taylor: Gordon Brown insults us all by claiming independence is an evilHowever, this action would have a consequence. As the leaders of the past, current and future Yes campaign, the SNP is responsible for creating that sensible economic narrative. Where does putting Mr Corbyn into Downing Street fit into it The Yes campaign needs to build economic competence. From scratch. Partly because it will help it win. But primarily becausewersquore going to be an independent country, then we need to be a grown-up country.

The reality is that any use of a phone distracts from a driverrsquos ability to pay full attention and the Government should consider extending the ban to reflect this.:Boy injured at Sinclair Castle fallRAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said: ldquoBefore outlawing hands-free phone use at the wheel we believe the Government should focus all its attention on enforcing the current law, which has been in place since  yet is still flouted on a daily basis by thousands of drivers.ldquoThe falling number of roads police officers has clearly not helped the enforcement situation. This is why we feel the time has come to look at new technology capable of photographing offenders using their hand-held phones while driving.ldquoIf hands-free use were to be banned then it could arguably be even harder to catch drivers in the act than it is now.ldquoDrivers should also be aware that, evenyou are using a hands-free device,you are not in proper control of the vehicle then the police can take enforcement action.A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: ldquoWhile mobile phones are a vital part of modern le and business, drivers must always use them safely and responsibly.ldquoBeing distracted by a mobile phone while driving is dangerous and puts peoplersquos lives at risk.

Philip Robinson contacted the Herald on behalf of an Italian acquaintance, Vanda Mammi, who has an old photograph of her late father Otello Mammi with another man and dog. The mystery picture of Otello Mammi with Sandy Thomson and dogPhilip siad, “Ms Mammi knows that after being captured and becoming a prisoner-or-war, initially at “Camp No ” near Sheffield, her father was employed on a farm, and that he had a local friend, named as Sandy Thomson. “The photograph shows these two men, and on the back of the photograph is the inscription of which reads “The Cottage, Badenscoth, Rothienorman. Mammi Otello and Sandy Thomson...”. Otello Mammi is on the left of the photo. The word at the bottom seems to be “Cluck” - I do not know the signicance of this.“It seems from this inscription that Otello Mammi was working in the Rothienorman area, perhaps at a farm owned by Sandy Thomson, or where Mr Thomson was also employed. Badenscoth is the name of a small locality about two miles to the North-west of Rothienorman.Philip added, “During my research I have found a reference to the Aberdeen Journal of March , which gives a numbered list of “additional War Work Parties”.One of the work parties was in the charge of “Miss Hislop, The Cottage, Badenscoth, Rothienorman”. Of course, this was too early in the war for The Cottage to have any connection with prisoners-of-war, but it would appear that the The Cottage had some connection with work for the war effort. It was evidently the home of “Miss Hislop” and the two men were later photographed there.“As you will see, the photograph is in poor condition with creases, surface damage etc. but its main features can be seen. The men are evidently standing in a porch which has a gable roof with decorative fretwork.”Anyone who thinks they could help Mr Robinson, can contact the Herald at news@inverurieherald in the first instance. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.motherwelltimes webimage ..!

Internal features such as stone benches have also been found along either side.The hall is oriented towards the sea and finds include steatite , pottery, a bone spindle whorl and a fragment of a Norse bone comb.The find provides tantalising evidence of the earliest phases of inhabitation on this farm and settlement mound which may well have been inhabitated for over , years.It provides another piece to the ,-year jigsaw along this archaelogy rich stretch of coast as Westness in Rousay — described as the #Egypt of the North#.A team of archaeologists from the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute, Rousay residents and students have been digging at the site for a number of years, investigating the later stages of the farm complex and its waste heaps with a particular focus on past diet, farming and fishing practices.Although only partly uncovered at this stage, the Skaill hall has parallels with other Norse halls excavated in Orkney, such as Snusgar, and where in Scotland.The excavation is part of the Landscapes of Change — Archaeologies of the Rousay Clearances and Westness Estate project which is exploring the Skaill farmstead.The present farm at Skaill dates to the th and th centuries and was part of the Rousay clearances during the mid-th century.The name Skaill suggests the site was home to a Norse hall or drinking hall, and was a high status site.Westness is mentioned in Orkneyinga saga as the home of Sigurd, a powerful chieftain, so it was always likely that a Norse settlement was located somewhere at Skaill.Earlier structures have been found below the present farm during previous seasons, and this season explored more of the Norse phases of the site.Three dimensional models of the farmstead can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Sales will be licensed from August   until October  . This short trial period takes advantage of the European Commission’s approval for Scotland-wide sales.Claudia Rowse, SNH’s head of natural resource management said: #We are delighted to announce Scotland-wide sales of resident greylag goose meat for a short trial period. Now, licensed sellers from Orkney will have a chance to develop the market for their product and people can try goose for themselves, on Orkney, and across Scotland.“Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. Striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult. Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, enabling them to control goose numbers sustainably, and sell goose meat for profit.”Until now, meat generated by the Orkney resident greylag goose project could only be sold locally by retailers based on Orkney.SNH is working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland. The overall number of geese will be maintained at a healthy, sustainable population. Sale of wild goose meat shot outwith the project is still prohibited under the Wildle and Countryside Act .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Residents need to be registered to take part in any future elections.Dennis Stevenson, the electoral registration officer for Orkney and Shetland, said: “It’s important that residents respond as soon as they can, so we can make sure we have the right details on the electoral register for every address in Orkney.“If you’re not currently registered, your name will not appear on the form. To make sure you can have your say at future elections, simply check the form you receive and respond as soon as possible.“All responses can now be made online and we would encourage householders, where possible, to use this method rather than ing the form in the post.”People who have changed address recently are particularly encouraged to keep an eye out for the form and check the details.Research by the independent Electoral Commission indicates that recent home movers are far less likely to be registered than those who have lived at the same address for a long period of time.Across the UK,  per cent of people who have been at their property for more than sixteen years will be registered, compared to  per cent of people who have lived at an address for less than a year.Further information about registering to vote is available on the Electoral Commission website at https:www.yourvotematters Any residents who have any questions can contact the Electoral Registration Office at  Broad Street, Kirkwall.

But now that Lord Ashcroft’s poll has confirmed that the feeling ismutual, there’s been a tidal wave of influential opinion pieces from the English left, urging Scots to launch the leboats and save ourselves. According to Matthew Norman in the Independent: “Were I Scottish, I would be mad for independence. I’d say sod the crude oil price [and] sod the Barnett formula.” Last week John McDonnell’s surprise revelation that Labour will not block a second independent referendum prompted the ’s John Harris to promise: “If another independence vote materialised … I would be back there [Scotland] in a flash, to seeat least one part of these islands can leave behind the current wretchedness, and find something better.” Yesterday the Observer carried a long piece from Aberdeenshire, where  per cent voted No in . Harriet Sherwood observed: “In Inverurie’s market square, most willing to express a view appeared to favour independence. But many who declined to discuss their political leanings may be supporters of the Union.” That’s perfectly true, but Sherwood’s piece is full of quotes from No voters ready to publicly admit they’ve changed their minds or at least are open to argument. Simon Jenkins’ no-holds-barred Comment is Free column last week was the most widely circulated on social media. Clearly no heartfelt supporter of independence, Jenkins surveyed the long history of English indference to first Irish and then Scottish Home Rule campaigns, compared Scotland’s flatlining GDP with that of soaring Denmark and suggested “separatists” should thank Boris and Brexit for hammering the final nails into the Union’s coffin: “If I were a Scot, I would vote for independence tomorrow. I would want nothing more to do with the shambles of today’s Westminster Parliament.”Scots-born Times’ columnist Iain Martin insists the end of the Union isn’t preordained but admits the “most ominous news for unionists” was that only  per cent of Ashcroft’s poll sample thought Scotland would vote to stay in the UK in a second independence poll. Actually the truly ominous news was probably already known. The UK Government’s private polling has remained unpublished in Scotland for obvious reasons – but Boris Johnson would be well aware of its contents. So, everything from the “do or die” Brexit declaration to the ridiculous  pence coin “celebration” has occurred in the full knowledge they are driving Scots towards independence. Clearly the Minister for the Union believes that’s a price worth paying. Martin’s solution has already been outlined by others without the capacity to enact it: “A commission devolving maximum powers across Britain, on taxation, for example, and something closer to a federal collection of states, pooling defence and foreign affairs [with] an elected replacement for the Lords in the shape of a Britain-wide senate.” Friend, it ain’t gonna happen and everyone knows it. Gordon Brown’s weekend intervention ironically confirms that the F-option is stone dead. Five years after his fateful Vow, the former Labour leader insists that, “to prevent the rise and rise of dysal nationalism, the first step is to stop no-deal in its tracks”. Really.Quite apart from the Ashcroft poll’s revelation that  per cent of Scottish Labour voters also back “dysal nationalism” , SNP politicians have been highly visible in the legal action that won the right for MPs to revoke Article  and will be part of this week’s court bid to stop Johnson suspending parliament. Despite taking pelters for their troubles, Nicola Sturgeon and her MPs are trying to stop no-deal in its tracks far more constructively than the party Brown once led. In fact, his stale rhetoric only serves to remind voters that “a system of government as close to federalism as you can have” never materialised. Instead the Brexit power grab and new Westminster plans to spend cash directly in Scotland mean the Vow is meaningless and its architect is lost in time. Still, the intervention of the English Left and prominent Remainers is strange, given that Scotland’s departure would leave them with a near-permanent Tory majority – or whatever worse fate awaits once Brexit delivers economic disaster. Are they motivated by a selfless “you go, because we can’t” sentiment or by enlightened self-interest – “you create a sane, social democracy because we may need escape north soon” A friend went south last month to visit English relatives who were quite hostile to independence first time around. Now they want to knowtheir kids will get passports in the new independent statethey attend Scottish universities now. It certainly seems that many English people are surprisingly clear-sighted and decisive about independence – either from a “glad to see the back of the whining Jocks” perspective or from an honest acknowledgment that Scots “didn’t vote for this mess”. My guess is that important strands of English opinion have never been sentimental about the Union. It’s just been an arrangement that has now run its course – in the view of prominent players on both sides. South of the Border, the Union has been a calculation, not a calling – however overwrought English politicians sometimes contrive to appear.Former Labour MP Tom Harris told Radio Scotland last weekend that the “hard Left” of his party “always regarded the Union as a colonial construct. That’s why Jeremy Corbyn stayed at home on his allotment when Labour MPs came up in .”Perhaps. In Scotland, though, that colonial construct has been much more than a calculation. It’s been cloaked with sentiment, studded with power and fuelled by the chronic fear of failure that bedevils the disempowered. Thanks to Johnson and Brexit, that cloak is slipping to reveal the intractable problems that blight the once gilded Union path. Opinion here is taking a while to turn, but that’s understandable.Folk are detaching from the authority of Westminster and considering the idea of a new independent country without a blueprint to hand. But make no mistake. Quiet consideration is a crucial part of any change process. A final decision needs a final focus – a deadline.

The ‘Barbour’ brand is the ultimate symbol of being proud to be British worn by celebrities around the world, including our own British Royal Family, and made in South Shields in North East England. Although Nicola’s grandmother did come from Sunderland, so it might have been an unconscious calling from her ancestors. ‘Second Working Man– “Leebralism is – feth I can hardly richtly tell dee what hit is!’“What is Leebralism” A Liberal candidate made it clear on a visit to Shetland.It is being in favour of the freedom of business and the freedom of the inidual, even though these may conflict.The man was standing for the European Parliament back when John Major was PM. He was speaking at an NFU meeting in the Lerwick Hotel.Asked about a Tory threat to the minimum wage protection that was in place for agricultural workers, he said he didn’t hold with a minimum wage workers should be free to accept as low a wage as was offered.Their “freedom” was to be exploited.Back then LibDems opposed Labour’s plan to extend the minimum wage on principle. Something to do with their backing from small businesses.Of course they changed their minds once it was clear it was going to happen.A bit like Tavish backing the right of women to join the Royal and Ancient golf club at St. Andrews, after they’d let them in.So the clash between securing the freedom of iniduals and that of business is resolved by sitting on a fence and waiting for a strong wind.What is Liberalism Whose round is it Another classic cock-up from the SNP!

The people of Shetland could then have consented to the project or not.In his book, The Liberal Challenge – Democracy Through Participation, Jo Grimond sought more opportunities for the public engagement in the running of their affairs, arguing increased involvement would be of benefit in itself and would promote further benefits.

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port. A breakwater will allow us to provide overnight berths and efficient, comfortable transfer for cruise ship passengers, while a visitor centre will provide a warm highland welcome to visitors from across the globe. This project will be transformational for Portree and surrounding areas.#The community trusts of Skye and Lochalsh all have several features in common. They have vision, ambition, energy and drive and they are full of volunteers who are committed to bringing long-term projects to fruition for the benefit of their community # and their visitors # for decades to come."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Skye-Bridge-2018-winners.jpg","title":"skye bridge 10k race to kick start kyleakin gala","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe first bridge k was held  years ago, and since  hundreds have taken on the challenge in an event which has helped raise thousands of pounds for good causes based in Kyleakin and surrounding areas.back again.Online entry — which is discounted — will be open until Friday th August, or runners can register on the morning of the race for £.

fascinating book of religious art that dates to the early s.-year-old Fred Brady bought the dusty tome from a market in Kildare over -years ago, and it had lain forgotten in his attic for decades.Published in  by the now seemingly defunct Catholic Picture Company of Ireland, the book includes high-quality prints of the Stations of the Cross, which depict the crucixion of Jesus Christ.While largely an artistic work, the book offers some detail of its publication. The book states that “being the nineteenth century of the Redemption of mankind” the then Pope, Pius XI, had proclaimed  a “Holy Year”.“These facts have prompted the publishers to devise and reproduce this beautul and artistic Album containing the fourteen ‘Stations of the Cross’,” it states.“The primary purpose of the work of Irish Art is to provide a most appropriate and lasting souvenir for the Catholic home, in honour and commemoration of Holy Year.”It also reveals that the artworks are “exact replicas of the celebrated and valuable set in the Church of Mount Alphonsus, Limerick”, which belonged to the Redemptorist Fathers, who gave permission for their reproduction.According to the Redemptorists in Limerick, the Stations of the Cross in their church date back to  – just four years after the church was officially completed.Explaining his find, Fred said: “I bought it in a massive market in Kildare. I’m  now, so I would say it was about  years ago, maybe more.“I liked it because it was the Stations of the Cross and I thought it maybe would be worth a few bob in a lot of years’ time, but I never tried to sell it or do anything with it. It was exactly like that when I bought it so it was a good few years old then.“I just found it up in the attic of the house. I was clearing the attic out because we’re changing over from oil to gas and I came across it again.”He continued: “I just want to see what’s what with it. I thought back then that it was an oddball of a thing to be getting sold. The only person I took it to was Father Hanna down in Clonard Monastery last week. He looked at it and said it was very, very good, it’s very nice, but he couldn’t give me an opinion of where to go to see about it. Then somebody told me to bring it up to the Andytown News.”He added: “If it turns out to be stolen or anything then I would give it back to whoever owned it, but I don’t think it is.”If you have any further clues or information about the book or its contents, please contact the Andersonstown News."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"lansdowne is ready to enjoy another golden age","story":"THE recent opening of the Lansdowne Hotel in the leafy surroundings of the Antrim Road and Cave Hill has got local people talking of how it was back in the day.It was the place to go and for one businessman, the opportunity to transform the once-so-popular venue was simply too hard to turn down.Born and bred on the Glen Road in West Belfast, Jim McLaughlin left home at  years old to pursue a career in the food industry.He worked in Cavan and Monaghan and boasts a spell as a chef at the Hilton Hotel in Amsterdam on his CV.Jim ed to Ireland and went to Benedict’s Hotel in Belfast city centre, working as their Head Chef before becoming manager a few years later.When the Lansdowne Hotel was put up for sale, Jim says it was an opportunity he could not turn down.“The Simpsons offered me the opportunity to be partners with them in their latest project – the Lansdowne Hotel – and here we are today,” he said.“The attractive thing for me was that when I came here  years ago when I was young it was for a night out and a bit of fun. Back in the day, the Lansdowne Court Hotel was the place to go in Belfast. In the past year or so, the place had become a bit tired and it was put up for sale. I see it as a great opportunity to restore it to its glory days and bring something to the people of the Antrim Road and North Belfast.”Jim and his co-owners have put a lot of money into the refurbishment and he is very pleased the way the stunning new premises have turned out.“It is the city centre on the Antrim Road,” he added. “Everything is top class from the drink, food, garden and bridal suite. We have invested heavily and also boast around  staff so it is great to bring jobs to the local community.“When we bought it last March, we thought it was going to be a quick refurb and it would be opened for Christmas but the further we looked at it, it wasn’t going to be a quick turnaround.“We wanted to do things right and we are very pleased with the way it has turned out.”Jim is hoping the eye-catching new surroundings and features of the Landsdowne will bring people through the door – and he hopes to bring his expertise to the project.“Our support from the local community to date has been second to none since we opened seven weeks ago.“Customers have been very welcoming to me and I want to welcome them too.“I am here every day as the face on the floor. My background is in s and food so I hope to bring a fair bit to the table knowledge-wise.“For anyone who hasn’t been yet, come and try us – you will not be disappointed!“We are open to suggestions for anything that can be improved.“The bridal suite is stunning. It is the only room that hasn’t been used yet but there are a number of weddings booked for later in the year.“The garden has been there over  years.“We have invested a bit of money in it for people to sit and relax, enjoy a bit of food and drink.“We also put a lot of thought into the food. It is served both in the restaurant and bar. The small plates are proving a huge hit with customers.“We think our food is top end and we are not charging top end prices.”“It is a pleasure to be here. I am really excited about the Lansdowne,” he added.The Lansdowne Hotel Antrim RoadBelfast BT EFTel:    www.thelansdownehotel"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland couple create stunning sea of","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The businesses in Portglenone are delighted as its brought a lot more people into the town.\"It doesnt take that long to sow the seeds,\" said Damian, who works at the local DLF Seeds company and knows what it takes to bring the field to le. \"It was just a couple of hours of walking up and down shaking the fiddle, but after that its out of your hands as to whether everything comes good.\"This year Damien and Karen, with their three children Cara , Ryanand Therese , have crafted another masterpiece. Visitors are greeted by scenes reminiscent of a Monet impressionist painting with a touch of Van Gogh, all on the edge of Seamus Heaney country.\"We live in a very green country with lots of rolling meadows, but people seem to like a splash of colour too. Its dferent and we like to think its a very romantic setting,\" said Damien. \"We had three marriage proposals in the field last year, wedding parties coming for photographs, plenty of fashion photo shoots, buses stopping off on tours of the country and, of course, plenty of photographers. There were also a couple of music videos filmed.\"The families who have come along are getting back to nature. Its so good that people are getting out into the fresh air and appreciating natural beauty. Kids are running around the path spotting butterflies.\"Thats an added bonus this year, with a neighbour lending an extra acre-sized field where Damian has created the perfect haven for butterflies, and when work commitments allow, he is only too happy to take visitors on a guided walk through the wildflowers.\"Its worked so well,\" he said. \"Were getting plenty of guests! \"Weve seen some of the rarer types, like painted ladies and peacocks. Youd almost think they were looking at you as the patterns on the wings resemble eyes. Its lovely to see them coming into their natural habitat.\"Obviously were relying a lot on the weather, but its been warm enough so far this year to allow the sunflowers to come out. They are a tropical plant, so heavy rain can take its toll, but theyve survived so far andwe can manage to get a couple of decent sunny days, even more of them should come out. Were at around % right now, and they thrive on direct sunlight.\"Karen and her kids, plus an army of young people from the town, have all been roped in to keep the meadow in tip top shape, and she expects the field to be open to the public for the next few weeks.\"Obviously theres a limited time span for when the sunflowers are in bloom, soanyone does want to take a stroll through, forget all about everyday le and lose themselves in a natural world, the next two to three weeks will be the best time to experience it,\" she said.\"In the meantime, were only too happy to have people as our guests, bring a picnic or a flask of tea and enjoy it while it lasts.\"This year, Damien and Karen are raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. Entry is £ or £ for  to -year-olds. Under s go free.

Some of the features retained in the house include a stone floor that is over  years old and a Royal Mail postbox that dates back to Queen Victorias reign. The unusual detail of the thatched house with its steep roof, eaves gutter and tall chimney is unique in Northern Ireland, according to the Department for Communities.This means the house appears to the passer-by as two dwellings, each with a front door, but it is in fact a single dwelling which for most of the past century has been home to the Maccombe family.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetMurray Maccombeis the third generation of his family to live in the magnicent dwelling, which sits on a three-acre site.Speaking to the Belfast , Mr Maccombe said he has fond memories of the house going back to his early years.He said: \"My grandfather Robert Henry Maccombe bought this house around  and it has been in our family since, but the original owner was a man called Hugh McCullagh.\"At the time my grandfather bought it, it was a farmhouse but also a grocers shop hardware store and it stayed like that until  when he opened a shop separate from the house.\"I have very clear memories of visiting my grandparents and obviously living there when my father Alan took it over.\"My father passed away in  but my mother stayed on, on her own.\"I moved in with my own family in  and I will be sad to leave the house, but really it has outgrown my we and I. \"Our two daughters are away at university and the reality it the house is too large for us to upkeep, especially the gardens, but it will be a great buy for someone.\"The house is being sold for Mr Maccombe by Donnybrook Estate Agents in Derry for offers over £,.Stephen McCarron said he expects that the house will attract a lot of interest.He said: \"We are delighted to have this magnicent property on our books for sale and there has been interest shown already from people in the UK and further afield. \"It is a property steeped in history but also comes with so much potential for development and I am optimistic it will have a new owner before long.\"Further details and an appointment to view can be arranged through Donnybrook Estate Agents on   "},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

That total and then some was passed in no time and has now risen above the pound, mark which has delighted Jeff.ldquoMany thanks to all the sponsors, supporters, players, umpires and scorers, Jeff enthused.ldquoThanks also to Liz Byrne, Jackie Wilson and Dave Crudgington who ran the refreshments and food made by chef Ryan Finnegan. We just couldnrsquot have achieved our target without the help of a lot of people and I can never thank them enough, he added.Sunday was an emotional day for Jeff and he was at times reduced to the odd wee tear.ldquoRodney Hassardrsquos tribute had me close to breaking down, but I was able to hold it together. I got my wish of playing alongside a lot of my former team-mates and I am indebted to them all for turning up and sharing the occasion with me.In the first challenge game of the day Dundrumrsquos current first team took on a squad of former Dundrum players that included Alan Mills and Darren Oldroyd, from Drumaness, Mark Yeates, from Downpatrick, and Byron Woodruff, from Saintfield.The game was competitive to say the least and thanks to decent knocks from Terry Hutley , Stuart Campbelland Sean CameronDundrum posted .Yeates sent the stumps cartwheeling on two occasions with Oldroyd also picking up two wickets. Harry Hitchins got the prize wicket of first team captain Ian Wright.The golden oldies rolled back the years in reply with Rodney Hassardshowing his undoubted class in his first game in five years.Woodruff made , including two big sixes off Cameron and Shilliday danced his way down the wicket, as used to be the norm, for a quick fire . Oldroydand Yeatescompleted the job with five wickets to spare.The second game saw some excellent ball striking and decent bowling from an NCU Select team.Saintfieldrsquos Byron Woodruff and the best young prospect in County Down,  year-old Adam Reid, treated all the bowlers with contempt as the runs flowed quicker than the refreshments.Man of the match Reid hit  not out in only  balls including eight boundaries and one massive six that went out of the ground.Superb all rounder Woodruff showed his old team-mates what a talent he is, hitting  in  balls with four big sixes and the same in boundaries.If both had not retired they would have scored centuries and the Dundrum bowlers were happy to clap them off. Ricky Owens then rolled back the years with a splendid , including three big sixes and three fours, the NCU side posting .It was perhaps fitting that Alan Mills, the oldest player on the pitch and still ultra competitive, finished  not out.Dundrum fought back well after the early onslaught with good fielding catching and astute field placing by captain Gavin McNerlin.Wickets were shared around with Chandar Shekhar the pick of the bowlers, taking  for  of three overs. Shilliday was again on the money and finished with  for . McNerlin, Keba Butler, Neil Reilly and Peter Calvert all got one wicket apiece.Dundrum got a steady start from Greg Hutleyand Rodney Hassard before Drumanessrsquo Neil Gelston removed them both. Oldroyd then hit the middle stump with successive deliveries leaving Dundrum on  for .McNerlin hit Gelston straight over the scoreboard in his  before Stuart Campbellwas run out by Woodruff. Saintfieldrsquos T McCavera picked up two wickets with CIYMSrsquo Steven Hughes and Woodruff also getting in on the act.The last wicket partnership of  between Neil Reillyand Keba Butlergot Dundrum closer than it looked as the NCU side ran out comfortable winners.The match ball sponsors were Bao and Bento and Pizza Palazzo, Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Downpatrick railway’s first afternoon tea event is runaway success  ","story":"THE Downpatrick and Co Down Railway got out the best china when it hosted its very first afternoon tea event recently.The experience started with guests boarding the train at Downpatrick town station and taking a relaxing journey, travelling in a comfortable s carriage, to Inch Abbey by steam train.They then boarded the buffet carriage where guests were welcomed by the volunteers with a glass of prosecco, wine or a soft drink, before being directed to their allocated tables to enjoy a mouthwatering selection of freshly handmade sandwiches, luxury homemade scones with jam and cream and mini French patisseries.Guests were also offered bottomless teas and coffees, or their own pot of luxury specialist tea.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner, who was one of the servers, said: ldquoThis is something wersquove wanted to do for some time, and itrsquos always been a very popular treat on heritage railways in Great Britain.ldquoNerves may have been a bit jangled as with all first events. How would it go down with our visitors  Wersquod never done anything like this before.As it turned out, stomach butterflies were swtly replaced with full bellies.ldquoIt sold out very quickly and in the end there were lots of smiling faces and empty plates, Mr Gardiner said. ldquoThe only downside was that the volunteers didnrsquot have any leftovers to enjoy.Mr Gardiner reveals the preparation that went into the event.ldquoWe knew the food would be great. It was freshly prepared by Franck Breacuteteacutecheacute from Mange Tout, who we have worked with before on private charters mdash including my own th birthday party mdash and we were determined that this would look the part.ldquoWe scoured charity shops across the county to give forgotten but beautul old bone china tea sets a new lease of le, including fabricating  new cake stands from scratch using these lovely vintage finds ndash no modern off the shelf crockery for us.ldquoIt also marked an attempt to ersy our offering and attract more people to the railway and the local area than might otherwise come.Paula OrsquoNeill, along with her friends Natasha Mellon and Denise McGuinness, travelled from Ardee in Co Louth and gave the day the thumbs up.ldquoThe gluten free option was excellent mdash great iety and lovely presentation with plenty of options of drinks available.

The group was also taken on a walking tour of Montalto Estate in Ballynahinch.The Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group also organised a charity garden party to enable the visitors to meet their friends from the Rowallane and Slieve Croob areas in an informal setting, which included the councilrsquos deputy chairman, Terry Andrews, and concluded with a rousing performance of La Marseillaise.Cllr Casey welcomed the French delegation with a reception at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel, Ballynahinch.He said: ldquoThe main objectives of the three-year plan of the twinning arrangement are to organise healthy activities and events, bring generations together in experiencing two fabulous cultures and share our heritage with partners from all over the south of Ireland, west of Scotland, Galacia in Spain, Wales, the Isle of Man and Brittany.ldquoAs part of our councilrsquos strategic objectives, we are striving to become a premier tourism destination on the island of Ireland, and empowering and improving the capacity of our communities.He told the visitors: ldquoThese objectives could not have been achieved without the continued support we have received from initiatives such as twinning arrangements.ldquoFrom visiting the area and investing in our local businesses, to bringing dferent cultural experiences to the citizens of our district through ious projects, I would like to thank you.He added: ldquoOur mission as a council is to lead and serve a district that is prosperous, healthy and sustainable.ldquoI am pleased to have you all here to celebrate the  years of this twinning arrangement.

If something does not happen soon we are finished, he said.ldquoTo be owed something like pound, by a public body like the Housing Executive is scandalous and someone should step in to sort this mess out.The crisis has been sparked off by staff shortages and industrial action in the accounts department of the Executive.A spokesman for the Executive said they were extremely concerned at the situation and had brought it to the attention of the Government.ldquoThere have been a number of vacancies in the department and we are unable to fill them because of the Government ban on recruitment to the public service. The result is that we cannot porocess these settlements as quickly as we normally do.He added: We are trying to do all we can to help the smaller contractors who are always much more vulnerable in such a situation.NEWCASTLE mdash A verdict of accidental death has been ed on Newcastle motorcycle ace Tom Herron, who died at the North West  earlier this year.Thirty year-old Herron, ranked third in the world, came off his bike at mph and smashed into a lamp post just  yards from the finishing line in the cc race. He died in hospital two hours later.The inquest at Coleraine heard how Herron had ridden in the race with an injury to his thumb and arm, but the pathologistrsquos report could not determine whether this would have interfered with his ability to control the bike at high speed.Two police constables, who witnessed the accident, told the inquest that the bike scraped the ground and the rider then lost control.The coroner, Mr Robin Wray, discounted suggestions to close the Portrush circuit and said that the racing gave a great deal of pleasure to a lot of people. He added that he had seen Herron race many times and always had a great admiration for him.DRUMANESS mdash Fresh hope for the old Drumaness Mill, which was becoming something of a white elephant, emerged this week with the news that Irish Waste Services have long term plans to develop it into an industrial estate.This week a spokesman for the company confirmed they had already moved on to the site. The long term plans for the , sq ft red brick building involve the setting up of an industrial estate with potential for several hundred jobs. The firm will advertise shortly for tenants and the spokesman explained that there was a real need for small factory premises providing employment in the area.The story of the mill since it closed down when owned by Hurstrsquos as part of the Ulster Weaving Group, when at one stage it provided work for  people, has been a long saga of disappointment.The mill was sold to Irish Waste for around pound, recently. This figure falls far short of the original asking price at a public auction held in Ballynahinch last year, which was believed to be around pound,.The news of employment hopes for Drumaness was welcomed by the chairman of Down Council, Mr Eddie McVeigh, who said it was ldquogood news indeed.He added: ldquoI would welcome anything which would bring jobs to the Drumaness area and I hope that this is not one of the many disappointments which we have suffered over the last few years.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Plessey Telecommunications in Ballynahinch was closed on Monday when more than  production workers walked out as part of a national campaign to obtain shorter hours and more pay.The strike action will be repeated on the Monday of the next two weeks and the production workers are also refusing to work overtime.Their demands are for a basic skilled rate of pound, a reduction in hours to an eventual  hours a week and two extra daysrsquo holiday.A spokesman for the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions said: ldquoWe would have prefer to have obtained our realistic claim by mutual agreement with the employers, but unfortunately we are left with no other alternative.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A strong plea is being made to boat owners on Strangford Lough to combat the nuisance caused by inexperienced owners of large fast powerboats.It comes from Mr T W McKee, of Sketrick Island, a noted yachtsman with more than  yearsrsquo sailing experience behind him.He is annoyed by a recent ldquomafia-type display of outrageous aggressiveness by a powerboat owner and would like to find an authority with the power to control such ldquoblatant abuse of delightful waters, not to mention the risk to innocent people and their boats by sea-borne thugs.In a letter to the Recorder, Mr McKee describes how his -foot yacht was rocked from side to wide so viciously by the wash of the powerboat, which buzzed around it, that his family and grandchildren were lucky not to be seriously injured as they were flung back and forth across the wheelhouse.He has passed the complaint to the Coastguard in the hope that they can have action taken, but understanding that use of Strangford Lough as a navigable waterway is free to all who wish to use it, he does not expect any success.PORTAFERRY mdash A public meeting is to be held in Portaferry next week to protest about plans for sewage disposal in the town.The meeting has been called by the local development association, which is concerned that the scheme about to be launched will be inadequate.Councillor Paddy Doherty, a member of the development association, appealed for the support of townspeople to support the meeting so that plans can be drawn up to combat the scheme by Ards Borough Council.Mr Doherty said the council originally proposed a filter bed scheme, which would pump treated sewage into Strangford Lough, but then abandoned the filter bed idea.LOUGHINISLAND mdash It was a historic day for the community in Loughinisland when Paddy McFlynn, the president of the GAA, declared open their new Macartan Park on Sunday.The weather certainly could have been kinder for the biggest day in the history of the club, but nevertheless there was a good crowd to witness the opening, as well as the football and hurling games.Mr Vincent Doran, the chairman of the club, welcomed the distinguished guests and said Loughinisland was one of the oldest clubs in East Down. They had a proud tradition and the opening of the new park was the fulfilment of a dream.The new park was blessed by Fr Charles Bready, PP, Loughinisland, Among those also presentwere Gerard McShane, East Down chairman T P Murphy, county secretary Harry McEvoy, Ulster Council delegate and Matt Fitzpatrick, county registrar.LISTOODER mdash Mr Thomas Steenson, who is leaving shortly to live in America, was the recipient of a specially inscribed Bible from Mr James Brownlee, Worshipful Master of Listooder Orange Lodge, at a dance in Listooder on Friday night..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gaelic championship fever erupts  ","story":"CHAMPIONSHIP fever will be sweeping through the county over the next five days.Reputations will be put on the line as all the sparring that has taken place throughout the league campaigns is replaced by an iron resolve to make a mark.The action gets underway tomorrow night with four games down for decision.Most interest will be focused on Pairc Esler with Clonduff taking on Saval in the SFC at pm. A few weeks ago Clonduff would have been regarded as red hot favourites to progress against their Division  opponents.However, it is uncertainthe Hilltown outfit will be at full strength as several of their players headed off to the USA a fortnight ago.Clonduff were beaten - to - on Friday night by Burren and given half a chance, Pat Havern and Daniel McCarthy could take full advantage of Clonduffrsquos misfortunes and lead Saval to a surprise win.The curtain-raiser for this game is the IFC encounter between Drumaness and Glasdrumman at .pm. Drumaness are expected to progress as the Quarter Road outfit have yet to win a game this season and seem certain to be relegated from Division .A Gary Murdock-inspired Drumaness beat Glasdrumman - to - at the start of July and they will be intent on repeating that result.There are two IFC games also down for decision over at Fontenoy Park when Drumgath face Darragh Cross and Teconnaught clash with St Johnrsquos.Darragh have been involved in a tense battle for promotion into the top flight, but recent defeats to Carryduff and Longstone have dented their aspirations.However, they are a championship team and in Shane Murray, Michael Monan, Joe McKinney, Matty Hardy and Anton McGrattan they have players capable of going all the way this year and Drumgath, who lie in second place in Division , will do well to get a result.The Teconnaught v St Johnrsquos derby should be a nice opener for the Drumnaquoile side who are more than holding their own in Division  with John Clarke, Conor Morgan, Marty Keenan and the Flanagans all in good form.Teconnaught, who won the JFC title last season, will rely on Paddy Grant, Jack Larkin, Ciaran Carville, David Kelly and Tony Davis to keep them competitive.Friday night sees another four games take place mdash two in Burren and two in Newcastle.A lot of focus will naturally fall on the SFC game between Kilcoo and An Riocht in Burren.Kilcoo have made no secret of the fact that they are determined to regain the Frank OrsquoHare Cup after losing out to Burren in last yearrsquos decider.They have blooded several new faces this season and are well in the running for the ACFL Division  crown, but they will not be taking An Riocht lightly, despite theirindferent season in Division . The Branagan, Devlin, Laverty and Johnston brothers will ensure Kilcoo go into the game in the right frame of mind.At the same venue, Shamrocks clash with Tullylish with the outcome hard to predict.Tullylish have fallen from grace in recent months and have been cast adrt at the bottom of Division . Shamrocks are in the top half of Division , but it looks asthey have missed out on promotion yet again.The game of the night should be in Newcastle where Carryduff lock horns with Castlewellan in the SFC.D J Morganrsquos Carryduff side seem destined for Division , while Castlewellan are battling to avoid relegation to Division .Carryduff have really made their mark this season with James and Daniel Guinness, Owen McCabe, Ronan Beatty, John McGeogh and Josh Connery all to the fore.Castlewellan are just now starting to get a few of their walking wounded back in action and Sean Dornan, Liam, Donal and Gareth McKibbin, Colly Flanagan, Rory Burns and Daniel Morgan could prove a handful for a young Carryduff side.The curtain-raiser to this game is the IFC encounter between Annaclone and Atticall.Ciaran Branniganrsquos Annaclone have been blazing a trail of glory at the top of Division  and it is unlikely that Atticall, who are  points behind them in the table, will inflict their first defeat of the season on them.Annaclone were held to a - to - draw by a fast-improving Ballymartin side on Friday night, but they still should have too much firepower for Atticall.Saturday sees another four games take place.Top billing goes to the Loughinisland v Longstone SFC clash in Castlewellan.Loughinisland have taken Division  by storm since theirthis season and are riding high in third place after Friday nightrsquos - to - win over a good Warrenpoint offering at Macartan Park.Longstone, on the other hand, are embroiled with Carryduff for an automatic promotion place at the top of Division  and now that Ambrose Rogers and Mark Poland are back to full fitness, this should be a cracking affair.Absolutely nothing separated the sides when they met in Division  last year and the same should be the case on Saturday.Loughinisland will rely on their big hitters Dan Gordon mdash still good enough to be playing county football mdash Jonny Flynn, Rory Mason, Stefan Mason and the McClements brothers and they should progress.This game will be proceeded by the Saul v Bosco IFC encounter.Saul,they can reproduce the sort of form they showed a fortnight ago to beat Carryduff, will be expected to ease past their Division  opponents, but championship football doesnrsquot always work that way.Bosco fell to a narrow - to - defeat away to Clann na Banna on Friday night while Saul were soundly beaten - to - by Bredagh.However, Donnan Ritchie will have his charges pumped up for this encounter with the Arnold, Harney and Mahoney brothers prepared to take the game to Bosco.It will be a short trip down the road to Kilcoo for the next two games on Saturday.Glenn play Liatroim in the IFC at .pm and Bryansford take on Bredagh.Neither Glenn or Bredagh have been causing a stir this season, but now is the time to turn it on. Liatroim should be at full strength with the McCrickard connections finally finished with their county hurling commitments and the Fontenoys might just cause an upset.The big game on Saturday night is the Bryansford v Bredagh game in the SFC.Bryansford have been plagued by injuries to key players all season long, but in Davy McKibben, Ruairi Wells, Danny Savage and Conor Maginn they have the men for all jobs and I would expect them to see off Bredagh.Brendan Masonrsquos outfit hammered Saul on Friday night and in Donal Hughes, Tommy McElroy, Eoin Costello and Conor Francis they have players capable of mixing it with the best, but last yearrsquos IFC winners might find Bryansfordrsquos physicality too much to handle.There are another three games to be played on Sunday.Ballymartin face Clann na Banna in the IFC at Mayobridge at pm before Warrenpoint take on Ballyholland and Burren lock horns with neighbours Mayobridge at Pairc Esler.Ballymartin seem to have turned the corner after a few disappointing results, but they are now operating at full strength again and warmed up for the championship with a draw against runaway Division  leaders Annaclone on Friday night.Clann na Banna are sitting in a comfortable mid-table position, but I donrsquot think they will give Ballymartin too much to worry about.The Ballyholland v Warrenpoint game should be another close encounter.Ballyholland may lie bottom of the Division  table, but Warrenpoint are only four points above them. The lsquoPoint have potential match winners in the Boyles and Ross McGarry with Ballyholland looking to the Murphy brothers, Tiarnan Rushe and Seamus Loughran.The Mayobridge v Burrren game is the tie of the round.Paddy OrsquoRourkersquos side, the defending league champions and Frank OrsquoHare Cup holders, will not relinquish their grip on both trophies without a fight.They have been a little bit inconsistent of late, but bounced back to their best on Friday night with a comfortable - to - victory away to Clonduff, while Mayobridge were beaten - to - by Kilcoo.In Kevin McKernan, Donal OrsquoHare, Liam Kerr and the McAvoy brothers, Burren have the perfect blend of youth and experience, while Maybridge will look to Corey Quinn, Shane Annett and the combative Conor Garvey to keep them interested.Downpatrick and Rostrevor bring the curtain down on the first round of fixtures when they clash in Hilltown on Monday night.The sides met last Friday night in the league at Petit Park with Rostrevor winning - to -. However, Caolan Mooney, who was literally unplayable in that game, is unable to play in the championship and that could well hand the initiative to the Hoops.Downpatrick will again look to big performances from their big game players and they donrsquot come any bigger than Gerard Colllins, Michael Magee, Conor McGrady, Jarlath Branagan and the Turley brothers.Without Mooney, Pete McGrathrsquos side will look to Conor Doyle, John Connolly, Shan Parr and Piras Kane for inspiration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great turnout for multi cultural event in Ballynahinch  ","story":"HUNDREDS of people attended the multi-cultural family friendly celebration at The Square in Ballynahinch on Saturday.The Connecting Cultures Event was held to help promote community cohesion and encourage acceptance and understanding of other cultures.In addition to music from all over the world, there were dancers entertaining the crowd, face painting, an exotic petting farm, stilt walkers, circus skills and cuisine from ious parts of the world.The African drumming proved particularly popular, with people of all ages keen to take part.

Wersquove had reports of youths consuming alcohol, using nitrous oxide canisters along with reports of damage caused to motor vehicles.Officers are working with British Transport Police to tackle this issue.Alcohol has been confiscated from groups of youths and a number of anti-social behaviour referrals orders have been made.Patrols have increased around the anti-social behaviour hotspots and operations at the train stations and surrounding areas will continue.I would also like to raise awareness of rogue traders in the area.Last week, officers attended to an address after concerns were raised about an elderly woman being asked to pay a large sum of money to have her patio cleaned.No money was exchanged and enquiries are ongoing into this incident.Residents should be wary of anyone who arrives at their property unannounced and uninvited and they should always very callers are who they say they are.We would advise people not to allow cold callers access to their property, to get at least two separate quotes before agreeing to have any work being carried out, to look out for their elderly relatives and neighbours, be vigilant and to contact the police immediatelythey are approached by any suspicious iniduals.If you see something suspicious or have any information related to this activity then call us on  or on appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was clear there was potential to design a scheme that would honour the buildingrsquos character and heritage, while creating something new and contemporary for future generations to enjoy.Features include double height windows in the duplex and both private and communal outside spaces. A full floor penthouse has a roof terrace to the front and back with panoramic views.Dorothy Foulkes, daughter of Stanley Sadler, who designed and built the distinctive building and ran his business from there for many years, still lives in Penarth and recently visited the site of the development.She said: ldquoI have many memories of the garage over the years. Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We learn about the Romans, World War Two, the American Civil War at school, but most people have never been taught about the history of their own country.ldquoWe have more castles than any other country in the world per square mile, and thatrsquos something worth celebrating.Fonmon Castle is a rarity among Welsh castles, uniquely well-suited to creating interactive events like jousting, workshops, Renaissance and Steampunk fairs, and many more.ldquoFonmon Castle is one of the few Welsh castles that is still lived in, explained Mr OrsquoHenessey. ldquoIt has remained within two families since it was built by the Marcher Lords during the Norman invasion.ldquoIt recently it was sold to a very friendly couple and they headhunted me in order to help them turn the castle around, to open it up to the public and help teach people more about Welsh history.ldquoTheyrsquove basically provided me a blank cheque. I want people to wake up in the mornings, and wonder lsquowhat shall we do today at Fonmon Castle rsquoThe first of these events, on Wednesday, August , will feature medieval re-enactments, living history displays, medieval combat lessons, have-a-go archery, childrenrsquos play areas and dino walks - and will be free.ldquoWe have so much history to offer as a country, said Mr OrsquoHenessey. ldquoI want to really start to show it off.To find out more, email info@fonmoncastle article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute. Let’s hope it’s the former.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flav_1.jpg","title":"top  moy park takes number one spot","story":"Posted on Thursday August  by Ulster Business From a purely editorial perspective it would be refreshing to have a dferent company head up the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list.But Moy Park has now made it to the top for eight consecutive years, as the poultry processing giant continues to expand both its workforce, global sales and pre-tax profit – firmly setting its place at Northern Ireland’s biggest business, with a workforce of more than , here alone.In the last year, it has grown turnover to just over £.bn, up from £.bn a year earlier, while pre-tax profits have surged by % – rising to £.m in its latest set of accounts, ending December .The business supplies Moy Park branded and own label chicken products to leading retailers and foodservice providers throughout the UK, Ireland and Europe.In numbers, Moy Park processes six million fresh chickens each week, , turkeys a year, along with , tonnes of other ‘added value products’.London-born Chris Kirke replaced long-serving boss Janet McCollum in , less than a year after Craigavon-based Moy Park was taken over by new US owners Pilgrim’s.And around a year ago, Flavio Malnarcicjoined the business – then as executive business director – before taking over as the firm’s chief financial officer.He was formerly business director at JBS Global, and has a senior leadership background as executive director of the poultry and export business in Seara, also as chief financial officer and chief executive at Tyson do Brazil and finance roles in Cargill.“There has been a consistence in the performance. We have been growing volumes… we got to six million birds each week, which is about a third of the UK market. For the UK, it is a signicantly big company.“Looking year-over-year, our performance was very consistent in the last few years.”“For people working there, working for a company which is the largest employer in a country, the top company, it is a source of pride for us.“But I don’t think that drives the behaviour of the team. We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s. They are very keen on efficiency, so that’s one of their strategies. “ a lot of focus in improving our performance, it’s how we can be more efficient, focusing on a portfolio that feeds our customer base, how we deal with our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
