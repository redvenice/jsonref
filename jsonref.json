He lost his children, his wife, and his international standing after Sir Andrew McFarlane, president of the Family Division, found he had conducted a ‘campaign of fear and intimidation’ against Princess Haya, forcing her to flee to London with their two children last April.         Dubai\u0027s Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (right) and his wife Princess Haya bint Al Hussein arrive for the first day of the Royal Ascot race meeting June 16, 2009The judge also found the sheikh ‘ordered and orchestrated’ the kidnap of Princess Latifa, who was snatched from a boat in the Arabian Sea in 2018. She and Shamsa are still captive in Dubai.Sir Andrew said the sheikh’s actions, on balance of probabilities, ran ‘contrary to the criminal law of England and Wales, international law and internationally accepted human rights norms’. The sheikh, who did not attend court, denies any wrongdoing. He repeatedly tried to keep the findings secret but the case was ruled to be in the public interest.Mr Beck said he had never forgotten the plight of Princess Shamsa, who ran away at 19 because of her father’s oppressive treatment of women and girls.She fled his Surrey estate, but after weeks on the run she says that after visiting a pub in Cambridge she was grabbed by four of armed heavies, injected with sedatives and taken back to Dubai.         In mid-July 2000 the ‘headstrong’ then 19-year-old princess – reportedly angry her father wouldn’t let her go to university and disgusted by Dubai’s human rights record – evaded high-security at her father’s sprawling Longcross estate (pictured) in Surrey, where the family spent most summersYesterday, both Tony Blair, who was prime minister in 2000, and Jack Straw, who became foreign secretary in 2001, denied any knowledge of the case.

This is a theoretical method of transmission – poor sanitation caused many SARS infections – but there is no evidence yet that Covid-19 has been passed on like this.HOW DOES IT MAKE US ILL?By forcing the lung cells of the infected person to replicate its RNA, Covid-19 disrupts normal respiratory functioning. This includes the constant waving motion of cilia: tiny hair-like projections in the lungs which sweep out mucus and dirt or particles that have been breathed in from the air around us.With this vital defence mechanism impaired, the lungs are more vulnerable to potentially deadly infections like pneumonia.We know that our immune systems are strongest when we are younger, so it is not surprising that children appear to be the least vulnerable to developing the worst symptoms of coronavirus.The opposite is true of elderly people, especially if their lung function is already compromised – for example, by life-long smoking or conditions like COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).       In people of all ages, the symptoms can be worsened when the body’s immune system goes into overdrive in its response to infection. White blood cells dispatched to fight the virus and reduce the inflammation in the lungs can damage healthy cells in the process.The fever experienced by many victims is another immune response, with the body raising its internal temperature to a level at which the virus can no longer operate.The majority of people infected with Covid-19 will experience symptoms so mild that they will not even know that they have had the disease.WHAT IS THE VIRUS’S ‘AGGRESSIVE’ STRAIN?Viruses mutate all the time and what the Chinese scientists have identified is a minor variation (known as L-type) to the existing Covid-19 (S-type) rather than a new and insidious new virus.The word ‘aggressive’ is being used to describe it but the facts are less alarming. The S-type which kicked off the epidemic in China appears to be milder and less infectious L-type seems to be more infectious – it currently accounts for 70 per cent of cases – but does not appear to be causing symptoms that are any worse.Bear in mind that new strains of influenza are evolving constantly. That is why our annual flu jabs contain two or three different vaccines which change year on year.Any future vaccine against Covid-19 will similarly take account of the different strains out there.WILL IT DIE DOWN OVER THE SUMMER?Respiratory infections are certainly more common in winter. There is no simple explanation for this, but one theory is that viruses can survive longer in colder weather when there is less UV radiation (which can kill microbes) from sunlight bearing down on the hard surfaces on which they linger.Or it may be that people get together in confined spaces more often in winter.Whatever the explanation, there is no way of knowing what warmer weather will bring for the coronavirus. During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, UK cases peaked in July.CAN YOU COMPLETELY PROTECT YOURSELF?Short of wearing a spacesuit, or stopping the people around you from breathing, the answer is no.But public health control measures proved highly effective in eradicating SARS in 20022003.Even if we are not completely rid of Covid-19, it may eventually evolve into different strains of the common cold – a recurring winter infection which many of us build immunity to, having caught it once.That said, there is no room for complacency. And if we can draw anything positive from the spread of Covid-19, it’s as a reminder that we cannot skimp on funding if science is to keep pace with the ever-evolving threats to our health both now and in the future. "},{"url":null,"title":"PLATELLS PEOPLE Boycotting Amber Rudd Oxford University just makes red","story":"Share this article That does not include their allowances for housing, gold-plated final-salary pensions and expenses.The armed forces, teachers, prison staff and police officers all got less than that, without the perks.

After we were able to raise our questions with them in a public forum, we grabbed our things and walked out.”The employee did not think the company would change course but on Friday, it did.Hachette “will return all rights to the author”, its statement said.“The decision to cancel Mr Allen’s book was a difficult one. At HBG we take our relationships with authors very seriously, and do not cancel books lightly. We have published and will continue to publish many challenging books.Hachette said it was committed to “making sure every day in our work that different voices and conflicting points of views can be heard” but also “offering a stimulating, supportive and open work environment for all our staff”.Allen, 84, denies the accusations by his daughter Dylan Farrow, which were the subject of two investigations. The director was never charged.Allen rose to fame as a stand-up comedian and comic writer and has made films for more than 50 years. He reportedly came close to publishing a memoir in 2003, reaching a deal with Penguin before changing his mind. Hachette said it made its deal with Allen last year.Hachette published Ronan Farrow’s Catch and Kill, an account of his work on #MeToo stories including the case against the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was convicted of rape in New York last month.In a statement in response to news of his father’s deal, Farrow said he was “disappointed” his publisher had “concealed the decision from me and its own employees while we were working on Catch and Kill – a book about how powerful men, including Woody Allen, avoid accountability for sexual abuse”.This year, Macmillan will publish a debut novel by Dylan Farrow.In her own statement on the decision to publish her father’s memoir, she said it was “deeply upsetting to me personally and an utter betrayal of my brother whose brave reporting, capitalised on by Hachette, gave voice to numerous survivors of sexual assault by powerful men.”On Friday, Hachette concluded: “Over the past few days, HBG leadership had extensive conversations with our staff and others.“After listening, we came to the conclusion that moving forward with publication would not be feasible for HBG.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b90185405b464236a43d6a147d746abbb4fe5abc/598_4_2757_1654/master/2757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40bcff00b40f513fb72c1425714b4fe9","title":"how small businesses can defeat the issue of late payments once and for all","story":"With some small tweaks, SMEs can better prepare themselves against the damage inflicted by late paymentsAfter one large online retailer paid Pietrasik late two seasons in a row, she decided to walk away and now prioritises small independent boutiques and her own website. “We’re focusing on staying strong and small,” she adds, “not needing to grow big and unstable. We grew very quickly and were stocked in all of the major department stores, but it didn’t necessarily mean larger or healthier profits.”And it’s not just big businesses taking advantage of their smaller suppliers, Torres says SMEs have a duty to pay each other on time, too: “Small business owners are busy people – and paying bills on time can often be a struggle. Paying a bill should be the first thing you do in the morning, whatever size business you are.”But it would be nice not to have to think about it at all, he adds. “My business isn’t chasing invoices.

He is a meandering, unfocused speaker, often unable to complete a sentence, let alone a thought, with a record in office that is decidedly patchy, marred by several past positions he struggles to defend. And yet Biden is now the frontrunner for his party’s nomination to take on Donald Trump. What’s more, the current mood, and specifically the threat of coronavirus, might just turn his defining weakness into a strength – and give him a serious shot at the White House.I saw his limitations for myself last month in Hudson, New Hampshire, as he paced around a high school gymnasium delivering a rambling monologue that suggested a politician well past his prime. Stronger on autobiography than policy, he strung together childhood memories, mottos taught him by his father and a kind of perplexed outrage that Trump’s America was not a country he recognised any more: “What’s this all about?” he asked, as if befuddled. “What do we stand for?” In New Hampshire, he finished fifth.Yet in the last seven days Biden has staged what is surely the most remarkable turnaround in modern US political history, a massive win in South Carolina setting off a chain reaction that brought victories across the south and midwest on Super Tuesday. Only Bernie Sanders now stands between Joe Biden and the nomination, with the map of upcoming primary contests tilted in the latter’s favour.Sanders likes to say it was the “political and corporate establishment” that handed victory to Biden, but that’s a stretch. For one thing, the Biden campaign was all but broke going into Super Tuesday, outspent by Sanders by a ratio of seven-to-one (and outspent by Mike Bloomberg by 100-to-1). Biden had only a skeletal presence on the ground, dwarfed by Sanders’ vast grassroots operation. Besides, it was not the establishment that turned out for Biden, but African-American voters – the most consistently faithful group within the Democratic coalition – who backed him over Sanders by huge, crushing margins. Along with suburban women, it was black America, not corporate America, that made the difference.There are plenty of lessons here. One is that money and organisation are not the decisive factors they were assumed to be: just ask Bloomberg, who spent $500m and won not a single state, while Biden won states he didn’t even visit. Another is that sexism and its offshoot - second-guessing other people’s sexism - pervades US politics. Elizabeth Warren was the smartest candidate in the Democratic field, the most accomplished debater and may well have made the best president, but she could not make headway. I saw part of the explanation for myself in New Hampshire, speaking to countless women who admired Warren enormously, and were desperate to see a woman in the White House, but who had ruefully concluded that their fellow citizens were just not “ready” to make that happen. They had seen how misogynistic unease with an older, opinionated woman had proved fatal to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and they were not prepared to risk a repeat of that in 2020. So they voted vote for a man instead. Perhaps inevitably, the face it chose was a familiar one, belonging to a man whom Democrats feel they’ve known for ever, whom most of them trust and like. Even the voters I met who were not backing Joe Biden described him the same way: as a “good man”, as a “really decent person”, as someone of warmth and “empathy”. Americans know the losses he has endured. His first wife and daughter were killed in a car crash when Biden was 30 his eldest son, Beau, died of cancer aged 46. Biden’s best moments in Hudson came as he listened to people talk of the pain they had endured. “Like most of you, I’ve lost a lot in my lifetime,” he said. “But I’ll be damned if I’m going to stand by and lose my country.” That ability to show basic human empathy could count in a country that is currently fearful, even bracing itself for disaster.Which brings us to the coronavirus. For four decades, the US right has had great success in persuading voters that government is the problem, not the solution. That’s found its most extreme form in Trump, elected on an implicit pledge to shake the whole thing up, if not burn it all down. He’s gutted government departments and run down federal agencies, left posts vacant or filled them with pals, cheered on by a base that for years has heard the fire-breathers of Fox News and talk radio cast “government bureaucrats” as the enemy.But how does such talk sound now, when people are trembling at the prospect of a pandemic? In a moment like this, people don’t turn against government, they turn to it. In good times, you might get applause railing against “federal officials” or “elite experts”. In a crisis, those are precisely the people with the authority to get a grip and offer reassurance.Suddenly, Biden’s 50 years as a Washington insider can be presented less as a liability than an asset, because that’s half a century of valuable experience. Better still, Biden is remembered as the number two in the most unflappably efficient administration most Americans have ever known, namely the one headed by Barack Obama. The fact that Obama chose Biden as his deputy has meant that, even without making an explicit endorsement, Obama has long served as Biden’s chief character witness. Now that line on the résumé counts for even more, with Biden’s presence in the team that presided over an economic recovery and governed with stability and calm – “No drama Obama” they called it – a prime credential.That will help Biden if he faces Trump, but it could also ensure he does. For Bernie Sanders’ brand is not one of steady calm so much as upheaval and “revolution”. That thrills his most devoted supporters but, Tuesday’s results suggest, it scares off those who yearn for stability. (At a crucial moment a fortnight ago, after he’d won in Nevada, Sanders could have moved to assuage those fears instead he reinforced them, defending his past praise for the record of Fidel Castro.) At any other time, Biden’s age, manner and CV could have doomed his candidacy. But with a plague looming, Americans might just view a flawed man of undoubted empathy and with an intimate knowledge of loss, a man who’s spent a lifetime inside the US government, as something like a remedy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b68d29678b33431d9e222c6bc863c69130fb625e/0_128_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d15866b45563e0e1593f881626811f24","title":"return of the burbot great lost fish to be reintroduced to uk","story":"Freshwater predatory cod species to make comeback after 50-year absenceForget dreams of wolves, bears or lynx – the next animal to be restored to the British countryside could be a river bottom-dwelling fish that resembles a giant tadpole.The burbot, much-maligned for its unprepossessing appearance with a fleshy appendage dangling from its chin, was last sighted in British rivers in 1969.A reward for spotting it remains unclaimed and now a costed reintroduction plan is being drawn up for Natural England, the government’s conservation watchdog.“The chance to bring back burbot to our rivers is hugely exciting,” said Jonah Tosney, operations director of the Norfolk Rivers Trust, which is masterminding the reintroduction plan. “Unlike beavers, lynx and sea eagles, they haven’t been gone for long only about 50 years. Anglers still remember catching them. We’re hopeful that recent work to improve water quality and to restore habitat has brought our rivers back to a good enough state to support England’s great lost fish.”The burbot, also known as the eelpout and the lingcod, disappeared at the same time as the otter vanished from waterways. In both cases, agricultural and heavy metal pollution may have played a role.Tosney said the cause of the burbot’s disappearance remained “a bit of a mystery” but was a combination of pressures including the disappearance of natural “messy” edges to rivers, including pools, flooded areas and back channels.“People did used to eat them but it’s more likely to be water quality and habitat quality slowly degrading since the second world war that caused their disappearance,” he said.The burbot, the only freshwater species of cod, once thrived at the bottom of cool lowland rivers across eastern England but leaves its preferred habitat for ponds and pools to spawn and so requires pools and other freshwater close to the river.Burbot could also be a beneficiary of beaver reintroductions, as the beavers create burbot-friendly habitat.The fish has been successfully reintroduced into Belgium and Germany, and Tosney said there were several river valleys in the East Anglian Fens with good floodplains that could be ideal habitat.Before the fish is brought back there will be further feasibility studies and also an environmental DNA survey to check there are no traces of burbot DNA in rivers, which would prove that a few survivors have evaded detection since the 1960s.The Norfolk Rivers Trust hopes to raise £80,000 to fund a five-year reintroduction pilot. Because of the high mortality rate for young fish, hundreds of thousands of young burbot will be first reared in captivity from eggs brought from European hatcheries.Dave Ottewell, a fish specialist for Natural England, said: “Over recent years great efforts have been made to restore our freshwater environment, rectifying some of the historic damage inflicted on these valuable and complex systems.“This work has focused on rebuilding the natural processes that underpin high quality freshwater habitats. It is the successful restoration of these habitats that has led us to a position where we can now realistically look towards the reintroduction of this recently lost species back into its native range.”The reintroduction may worry trout fishermen in particular because the omnivorous burbot will eat trout.“They eat pretty much everything – invertebrates, other fish, and trout, no doubt about it, but trout will also eat burbot,” said Tosney. “Anglers do not like predators but I can’t see any other reason to object – it’s a native species, it should be here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efdace8b3262d68c1a15298e771d3b060d224258/0_0_8688_5792/master/8688.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7f0b976ebda5f5ea2f333b1f52468efe 1440w","title":"cinema coronavirus projected 5bn loss","story":"Blockbuster releases remain largely on track, as do plans for the Cannes film festival but unease increases behind the scenesA spokesperson for Cineworld, which owns multiplexes throughout Europe as well as UK arthouse chain Picturehouse Cinemas, pointed to the fact that most releases remain on track, with studios apparently reluctant to change schedules unless it becomes absolutely necessary.“Admissions remain high,” Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK cinema association told the . “In line with the advice given by the deputy chief medical officer this week, all sites will remain open,” he said.A similar defiance was demonstrated by the Cannes film festival, which said it remained committed to proceeding as planned in mid-May.On Thursday, the French government extended a ban on public gatherings of more than 5,000 people until the end of May.“It’s a confidence thing,” one industry source added. “You can’t start saying you’re worried. It has to be very on until it’s suddenly very off. In part, that’s just a legal and insurance thing.”More than 12,000 delegates attended Cannes last year, but the largest cinema at the Palais des Festivals seats only 2,300. Invitations to the Cannes lineup press conference in Paris on 16 April were sent out on Friday morning.Cannes regained credibility as a launchpad when three of its 2019 premieres – Parasite, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Portrait of a Lady on Fire – performed well during awards season.This followed a couple of underpowered editions for the festival in which its programme was overshadowed by Cannes film festival director Thierry Frémaux’s row with Netflix, whose films he barred from awards eligibility.Pressure on festival directors not to skip a year would therefore be considerable, despite both unsettling government advice and increasing industry precedent.On 4 March, organisers of the Cannes MIPTV content market – which also takes place in the Palais – announced they were cancelling this year. Forty of France’s cinemas have been closed and the number of confirmed cases in the Cannes area has reached double figures.More than half of Italy’s cinemas are closed and regulations prohibit people from sitting less than a metre away from each other in public.Mario Lorini, president of ANEC, the national association of exhibitors, has unveiled a system he hopes would comply and enable cinemas to remain open: allowing the booking of every third seat in a row, with empty seats directly in front and behind.Lorini said his team had been “working round the clock” to try to make the plan viable.On Friday the International Indian Film Academy Awards were postponed because of “sensitivity” over the mounting health crisis. Originally due to take place on 27 March, the annual gala is Bollywood’s version of the Oscars.The inaugural Red Sea international film festival in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, was cancelled earlier in the week, and increasing numbers of attendants – including Amazon and Apple – have withdrawn from the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas. SXSW has a significant film sidebar, and is still scheduled to take place for 10 days from 13 March.But it is the mainstream end of the film industry which is likely to be hit hardest by the spread of coronavirus, while smaller films and streaming sites such as Netflix could be set for an unexpected boost.MGM’s decision to delay the release of the Bond film was applauded by many, despite a potential $50m bill to cover logistics – as well as costs and share falls for the many sponsors whose tie-in campaigns have already begun.In earmarking an alternative window quickly, the studio has bought dominance over a key date in the cinema-going calendar – No Time to Die opens in the US over Thanksgiving weekend – while the seven-month hiatus allows time to redraw plans.“That feels like a safe amount of breathing room,” said a source close to the production. “Tentpole movies live or die on large audiences going out of their houses and watching them in cinemas with hundreds of other people. Right now, nobody wants to do that.”“In China infections seem to have peaked but you can’t see them opening cinemas before June,” said another industry insider, “nor people being keen to go for a while after that. Add three months for the rest of the world and November starts looking very attractive.”Widespread cinema closures across China, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan and South Korea have already done drastic damage to the global box office, with one consulting firm suggesting that the loss during China’s new year holiday alone amounts to around $1bn.Among projected big-hitters yet to be released in China’s 70,000 screens are Dolittle, Sonic the Hedgehog and Oscar contenders such as 1917, Marriage Story, Jojo Rabbit and Little Women. When cinemas do reopen, the backlog will cause further delays and local titles will be prioritised.Bond’s distributors did not directly mention coronavirus in their Wednesday statement, instead saying that the decision had been taken after “careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace”.Two-thirds of the money made by Bond movies comes from outside the US, with east Asia increasingly courted by Hollywood producers.Forthcoming blockbusters such as Mulan – whose $200m budget makes it Disney’s most expensive live-action remake yet – and the ninth Fast and Furious film are highly reliant on Asian markets for their profits.The Chinese premiere of Mulan was cancelled some weeks ago and updates are anticipated from Disney on any changes to the worldwide launch, which is currently still scheduled for 27 March.Early estimates suggest that Mulan’s US opening weekend may still manage a $90m take, with some crediting coronavirus’s reportedly less dramatic impact on children as one reason that family films may not suffer as much as their adult counterparts.How Mulan fares will have substantial implications for the strategy surrounding Disney’s first blockbuster of the year: Avengers spin-off Black Widow, which is meant to open worldwide at the start of May.Should these films flop, many forecast a domino effect as studios scramble to reschedule tentpole releases. F9, Scooby-Doo movie Scoob!, Wonder Woman 1984 and Netflix’s Eurovision movie are all early summer releases whose release dates look vulnerable.Production disruption is already considerable, with Paramount halting a planned shoot in Venice on Mission: Impossible VII last week citing “concerns of the crew”.“Who is going to underwrite a movie which goes into production next week?” queried one source. “If an actor is due on set in say, late March, their agent might well forbid them from working, saying it’s too dangerous.”Nervousness was demonstrated by talent agency CAA on Wednesday when it clamped down on anything other than virtual meetings. The same day, Sony Pictures’ offices in London, Paris and Poland were shut for the remainder of the week after a UK employee was feared to have been exposed to the virus while travelling abroad.Paramount is, however, pressing ahead with the release of the sequel A Quiet Place Part II on 20 March. Just a 10th of the original film’s $340m take came from China the curious parallels between the plot – a family self-isolates to try to survive – perhaps boosting its box office appeal among populations relatively unaffected by illness.Contingency plans for mid-range releases may involve fast-tracking them to streaming services, where there is likely to be a substantial appetite from a captive at-home audience.Water-cooler titles such as Promising Young Woman – in which Carey Mulligan feigns drunkenness on nights out before taking bloody revenge on men who attempt to take advantage of her – are thought to be prime candidates for films that could do well online, if a cinema release appears optimistic.However, legacy inertia could make such innovation challenging. “The ecosystem of release strategies would be really damaged by that kind of thing,” said one source. “Everything is booked and lined up already. I don’t know if that tactic has real financial merit.”The industry’s structural makeup may also prove problematic, with studios and exhibitors prizing competition over collaboration, meaning strategy communication is limited.“It’s uncharted territory,” said one source, “but that also means there are lots of opportunities out there if streamers can move quickly.”Representatives for Netflix and Amazon did not respond to the ’s requests for comment, but a boom in users and dwell time over the coming weeks appears likely.Even long-established studios are seeing silver linings online. Contagion, Steven Soderbergh’s unfortunately prescient 2011 thriller about the global outbreak of a deadly virus, has proved such a viral hit over recent weeks that it’s already Warner Bros’ second-best-performing film of 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e335ebf4c2f867f5308d69c9186fb4c826543d98/0_293_7200_4320/master/7200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3c1e2dfbf0b386fe86ba2272503f247","title":"spenser confidential review mark wahlberg netflix","story":"The actor plays a justice-seeking ex-cop in a clumsy, unfunny adaptation of a much-loved literary crime seriesMark Wahlberg’s first film for Netflix, a charmless little shrug of a caper called Spenser Confidential, is the kind of film that evaporates as it’s being watched, destined never to be thought of again. It’s regrettable given those involved, from director Peter Berg, who has worked with Wahlberg four times before, including on 2016’s criminally underseen Deepwater Horizon, to writer Brian Helgeland, who won an Oscar for his LA Confidential script before getting nominated for Mystic River. It’s also a story based around a much-loved private eye created by Robert B Parker, one who provided inspiration to crime authors such as Dennis Lehane and Harlan Coben. But it would take a master sleuth to detect any of that pedigree in the finished product.Wahlberg, slumming it before later this year starring in both a summer sci-fi thriller and an Oscar-bait drama, is Spenser, a Boston cop getting out of prison after assaulting a colleague he claimed was crooked. His plan is to leave the city and the ghosts within it but when the cop he attacked is found murdered, he soon gets sucked into a murky underworld of drugs, violence and corruption.It’s an action-comedy-mystery-thriller that manages to spectacularly fail at all the above, an algorithmic abomination that’s as coldly constructed as it is clumsily made. It’s actually surprising just how flat the whole thing is, given that Berg has experience with bigger budgeted films with a more ambitious scope, but there’s a deadening lack of spark to his direction here which he tries to hide with lively and recognisable soundtrack choices. The character of Spenser appeared in the 80s in a network show called Spenser: For Hire and one can see this envisioned as a franchise-starter for Netflix, given the wealth of stories from Parker and later Ace Adkins, who took over writing duties. But Berg never once shows us why this should be the case. Spenser is identical to every other wisecracking, punch-throwing, gold-hearted tough guy that we have seen before and the plot he finds himself up against is similarly tired.It’s a dusty, connect-the-dots plot that offers nothing in the way of surprise even if Helgeland, and co-writer Sean O’Keefe, try to include some throwaway references to fake news, gentrification and the opioid crisis. Spenser is paired with wannabe MMA fighter Hawk, a partnership that’s built up to be fractious but in actuality is bizarrely easy, the two getting on almost instantaneously, denying us of any quippy conflict. Playing Hawk is rising star Winston Duke, who broke out in Black Panther and then Us, but he’s given nothing to do here other than throw the odd punch, a strangely thankless role given how the character played such an integral part in the original Spenser series of books. There’s also a sleepwalking Alan Arkin as Spenser’s mentor, an unfunny turn from comic Iliza Shlesinger as his ex and Bokeem Woodbine, saddled with a predictably structured turn as his old partner. As Spenser himself, Wahlberg is coasting, sticking to a dog-eared playbook, as bored as we are watching him. A snappier script could have and should have found smarter ways to utilise a talented troupe of actors such as this but instead, they’re wasted, unable to lift the pedestrianism of what they’re saddled with.It just sort of sits there, desperately needing an injection of something: humour, style, better action, energy, life. Spenser Confidential will find an audience on Netflix, given Wahlberg’s involvement, but this is soulless bargain basement stuff."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/152223a0443ca1665559d436b180d6391a363070/0_0_4432_2659/master/4432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=970d8477c2abe03456ab23192c511e0d","title":"manchester city face ultimate test to maintain pep guardiolas legacy","story":"The club can learn from cautionary tales of Manchester United and Liverpool when trying to prevent a slump after successAt Liverpool in 1990 and Manchester United in 2013 an era of dominance became a spiralling freefall. After Kenny Dalglish claimed an 18th title for the Merseyside club, a 30-year drought followed. Sir Alex Ferguson led United to a 20th crown and the wait for a 21st will stretch into an eighth season. Both plunges occurred after the manager stepped away – Ferguson in May 2013, Dalglish in February 1991.When Pep Guardiola one day departs as Manchester City manager, the history of their two fiercest rivals may resonate for those charged with replacing him.Guardiola’s contract expires in June 2021 and the club’s two-year Champions League ban has renewed attention on his future. The coach insisted he was open to renewing his contract but so far he has never stayed at a club longer than his four years at the Camp Nou. The ban may be retained, reduced or scrapped but whatever happens City’s Guardiola endgame may be played out sooner rather than later. The appointment of a successor will be the most important strategic call of Sheikh Mansour’s ownership since Guardiola was hired in the summer of 2016.Last Sunday Guardiola claimed his sixth major trophy with City by winning the Carabao Cup. He is comfortably the most successful manager in their history. And yet a high-ranking executive insists the Catalan is not the most important person at City. The declaration spoke to a long-term strategy overseen by Khaldoon al-Mubarak, the chairman, and executed by the sporting director, Txiki Begiristain, and chief executive, Ferran Soriano. Their task is to ensure that whether Guardiola or AN Other manager is in charge, City’s underlying philosophy is maintained: in broad terms this is to play stylish football while accumulating silverware.Liverpool’s Boot Room provided them with highly successful managerial solutions in the past, and Mubarak, Begiristain and Soriano have in place an equivalent of sorts: the eight-club City Football Group, of which Manchester City are the flagship. In addition to offering Mansour a global reach, the CFG is a finishing school for prospective managers to take charge of its various teams.Patrick Vieira moved from leading City’s reserve side to become New York City FC manager in 2016. Nick Cushing departed as City Women’s head coach to become NYCFC assistant manager this February, and Erick Mombaerts stepped down from Yokohama F Marinos in January 2019 and took over at another CFG club, Melbourne City FC later in the year.The profile of the job, though, plus the pressure of following Guardiola, means if a homegrown replacement is desired to take over then rather than searching within, Mubarak, Soriano and Begiristain may look to lure back Vieira, who has been in charge of Nice since 2018, or Mikel Arteta, who was Guardiola’s assistant until leaving to lead Arsenal in December.Among contenders with no links to the club are Mauricio Pochettino, who got the better of Guardiola as Tottenham manager in an epic Champions League quarter-final, and RB Leipzig’s Julian Nagelsmann. They appear to be similar spirits in footballing terms.“They’ve created a spirit where everybody wants to be part of that journey. When a club is not run well, when there are too many people talking about who should be brought in, too many people talking about maybe even team selection, what do you do then? You attract the wrong type. And as a player you get a feeling when you speak to people at a club. You think: ‘Either something is growing or I go here because I get an awful lot of money and if it doesn’t work out, I will be off after 12 months.’” Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:www.thefootballaudio2020mar05dier-straits-the-fa-cup-and-coronavirus-football-weekly-extra-podcast To find a successful heir to Guardiola, Mubarak and City would have to be pioneers. A dynasty in the Premier League era is yet to be achieved. Ferguson’s feat was a generational success at United in the 1990s and 2000s but there was no smooth transition of dominance to an heir, as first David Moyes, then Louis van Gaal and José Mourinho failed to seriously compete for the title.Ferguson’s departure occurred concurrently with that of the chief executive David Gill and was compounded by the removal of key coaching staff – Mike Phelan and Rene Meulensteen – by Moyes. The culture imbued by Ferguson across a 26-and-a-half-year reign vanished, and a vacuum of leadership and direction prevailed.When Dalglish left, Liverpool believed all of this remained intact. A proud lineage that began with Bill Shankly’s arrival as manager in 1959 and ran through Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Dalglish, appeared safe when Graeme Souness became a fifth permanent No 1 in 32 years. Souness, a former captain who played under Paisley and Fagan and with Dalglish, was steeped in the club. With Roy Evans and Ronnie Moran on the coaching staff there was firm representation of the club’s vaunted Boot Room.Evans, who took over from Souness, says: “Continuity was a big part of our success because you were not getting major changes. When you’re changing managers for someone who hasn’t been at the club, normally it takes a while for them to blend in, though not too much with Jürgen Klopp at Liverpool.Hamann cites another of his former clubs, Bayern Munich, as an example that might lend itself to the appointment by City of an outsider such as Pochettino. Hamann says Bayern’s approach is predicated on a variant of the “family and friends” model at City. Its version is to look outside for star coaches – as with Guardiola (2013-16), Carlo Ancelotti (2016‑17), and Van Gaal (2009-11) – who walk into an operation teeming with former players in on- and off-field roles.As at City, those who take strategic decisions adhere to club ethos. “Not understanding the culture of Bayern Munich is absolutely impossible,” Kern says. “Tradition plays a very important role, since the times of Beckenbauer and Müller.“Without Ferguson, Manchester United would not have been the same. Success depends always on big personalities, and we had fantastic personalities a Bayern, and we will have in the future.”Here Kern hints at the complexity of replacing Guardiola. A manager will be sought with the ability to continue Guardiola’s unparalleled success, the personality to allow deference to club philosophy and the courage to follow a genius.As at Liverpool when Dalglish left, Barnes states that even with structures in place an appointment can backfire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da591d12e459aaa3900b1e071307dc87d8d1fb6a/0_51_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76548c097fbf2a5c631e6fe2f6bd71ab","title":"from sous chef to security guard how the nation uses its smart speakers","story":"While more than one in five households now own a smart speaker, not everyone is getting the most out of their device. We asked some Amazon Echo users to share their most-used commandsSmart speakers have become a fact of life in the UK in 2019, so much so that in March this year, they were added to the list of items the government uses to accurately measure the cost of living.For some, the Echo is the perfect device to keep children entertained on a regular basis. Laura Moross, a PR consultant from London, explains that her family’s Echo is placed in the kitchen, so that she can use it when playing with the children or helping her kids with their homework.“At breakfast we can shout out song requests – everything from Baby Shark to G-Love and Special Sauce,” she says.Last Christmas, she says, she used the Echo to amuse her children by asking Alexa to track Santa’s whereabouts around the world, as well as asking: “Alexa, how many sleeps until Christmas?” Meanwhile, her children are also amused to hear the Echo’s various fart noises on demand.Meanwhile, Govind Dhaliwal, 31, from Milton Keynes, uses the device while he cooks – to convert units of measurement, and also as a timer.“I can run multiple Alexa timers simultaneously – and I can identify each one by giving them names, that way I know when to check on the food,” he says.Dhaliwal also uses the BBC Good Food skill from time to time to get specific recipes read out to him. He says that the “hands-free” element helps him to focus on cooking without having to keep washing his hands to revert back to a screen to read the recipe again.“It’s especially helpful as you can ask Alexa to pause the recipe while you carry out each part of the method and then carry on from where you left off,” he says.Kate Smith, 35, from London, asks Alexa to turn on her downstairs lights when she walks into the room. This works using a smart plug, which she has connected to her lamps.“It’s quite nice to walk in and be able to turn on the lamps to provide mood lighting, as we don’t use the main lights as much,” she says.In addition, Smith asks Alexa to add items to her shopping list, which can also be viewed on the Alexa app on her phone, meaning she doesn’t have to worry about forgetting her shopping list anymore.For Paul Granger, 67, from Derbyshire, the main reason he uses the Echo is to listen to Audible in his living room.“Since retiring I have more leisure time, and I enjoy being able to sit down and listen to one of my favourite books, while taking in the view of my garden at the same time,” he says.In addition, Granger uses Alexa to remind him to take his medication and to ask for the latest news from the . To do this he asks Alexa to open the , and then asks for the latest cricket headlines and the latest news on Brexit.There are also those that rely on Alexa to control their smart homes.Kelly Morgan, 23, from Hull, has connected her smart speaker to her smart lights, doorbell, camera and lock. This means she can ask Alexa to lock her front door without the need for keys. It also gives her peace of mind when she’s on holiday.“We keep the Echo on when we’re away, as the doorbell triggers Alexa announcements, and we also have scheduled the lights to go on at certain times to give people the impression that we’re at home,” she says.As our world becomes more connected, smart speakers will only prove more useful – perhaps, one day, even vital. But even in 2019, a mere five years since Amazon Echo first hit the market and took smart speakers mainstream, the question is less “What can I use my Echo for?” and more “What can’t I use it for?”Learn more about what you can do with Alexa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24b22eeab50acc7b9dfd2966c05a8568c6abde54/0_317_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df671746e64d79ac6e90201c3a3e058f","title":"can a shaman cure my insomnia","story":"I always rejected my mother’s ideas of chakras and balance. But on holiday in Bali, I saw a sign: healing this way“At the end of the session, Sami will tell you all your problems,” reads the outline of my meeting with a traditional Balinese healer, the fifth generation of shamans in his family. All my problems? How long has he got?I did not expect that a holiday in Bali would lead me to a healer, in search of an insomnia cure. The idea of chakras has never really appealed. I grew up with these concepts, having been raised in a mostly Asian community, by a mother who evangelised about mind-and-body balance. To this day, the smell of incense conjures up my childhood. But that was all the stuff of my elders who, in my teenage eyes, seemed stuck in the past. Later, I’d smirk when people called this stuff “new age”. New for who, exactly?But in Bali I saw a sign on the street: Healing This Way. And, perhaps moved by the sight of exquisite temples and their devoted attendees, combined with a when-in-Rome attitude and worsening sleeplessness, I followed that sign.As I write, I don’t know if it worked (Sami said to wait three days). I know that the full-body procedure was painful: the fingers prodded deeply for pressure points. And I know that when he “cleansed my energy” and said I shouldn’t criticise myself too much, nor worry about things I might have done wrong in the past because I did everything right, that I felt tears rush to my eyes. (Although I had also been punched in the butt for an hour, so that might explain it.)In the taxi home, I read about the placebo effect – how it is no longer seen as a medical failure, but an effective treatment for conditions in which the brain controls symptoms such as insomnia. If you can trick the brain into thinking it’s healed, it is. But I don’t remember much of the journey after that, as I slipped into a very deep sleep."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e0ced5796cc9b79df841d325b4c2fc7a8605331/0_7_1172_703/master/1172.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83b2796ebd5ba15d1908e3ef5dca96c5","title":"not learning portuguese romesh ranganathan this is europe","story":"I am still being lazy and ignorant, but this time it’s for a reasonThis summer I will be visiting Portugal for the fifth year in a row, which is either a huge compliment to the country’s hospitality or a true illustration of the rut into which the Ranganathans have descended. We even go so far as to stay in exactly the same place every time, considering it adventurous to pop to a beach we haven’t been to before.The reasons for this are mainly to do with how great Portugal is: it has sunshine and beautiful beaches and lovely food and welcoming locals, like many holiday destinations, but without wanting to sound like one of those wankers who’s just been travelling, we just like the vibe. I also love familiarity. I like turning up to the house and knowing whose room is whose. I know that we unpack quickly and head to the local supermarket to stock up. I know that I text my mum to let her know we’ve arrived safely, and she replies telling me to remember that children go missing there.The one thing I haven’t done, much to my chagrin, is to learn any Portuguese whatsoever. The truth is that there is no real need, as everybody is used to tourists and speaks impeccable English, but still it feels lazy. The first time I went, I didn’t feel bad I’m not going to start learning a new language for a single trip. But having been many times now, the decision not to try to at least pick up some key phrases seems wilfully ignorant.Before my wife and I had kids, when holidays were about having a nice time, we visited Barcelona for a weekend. I speak a little bit of Spanish, and used it when we went to restaurants and bars. The main effect was impressing my wife, because she speaks no Spanish and it looked as if I knew what I was doing. In order to keep her impressed, I had to pretend that what arrived at the table was what I thought I had ordered, and that, yes, I had decided that tonight she might like the squid she had always told me she hated.Learning Portuguese would be a wonderful way of connecting with the locals and engaging with the country in a deeper way. But I know this is not what will happen. What is more likely to happen is that I will try to learn Portuguese for a couple of weeks, forget about it for ages, and then start again in the two weeks before the holiday. Then my wife and children will watch me offend a series of locals by struggling to say something basic, and then being completely unable to understand the response.For this reason, I would strongly argue that not speaking Portuguese not only makes the holiday better, and subject to fewer logistical errors, but is also better for Ranga–Porto relations. And so I have resolved not to learn the language, and this time feel much better about it, because it is a considered rather than a default position. I am still being lazy and ignorant, but for a reason.What I could do instead, over the next few years, is learn at my own pace. Gradually pick it up with no deadline, until one summer, as we head to the first supermarket shop of the holiday, I start smashing out fluent Portuguese, understanding responses, and engaging with grocery items in a way that previously seemed impossible. My wife and children will look on in awe as one of the shop assistants unlocks a door accessible only to people who speak the language – where the bread is fresher and the prices lower.Far more likely is that I don’t, and instead use my one Portuguese word in every interaction and wait for the locals to be impressed, in a way that I haven’t been by the fact they speak completely fluent English. And then I will kiss my new blue passport."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f97d2d67dbc852ec693ae31f95f79ced8d10dd00/0_128_5557_3333/master/5557.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=838c94e6a3fb0782aff9817cc88f7a9e","title":"gran designs could building my mother an upstairs flat renovate our relationship","story":"Friends thought we were mad and tried to dissuade us. Despite misgivings, we went aheadWhen my elderly mother came to live with us, a granny flat was not an option. She needed more space than the typical one-room studio. Being frail and disabled, logic might have dictated that she take over the ground floor of our home and we build an upper floor extension for ourselves – the kind real estate agents promote as a “parents’ retreat”.But, as a longtime top-floor apartment dweller used to expansive views, living downstairs did not appeal to her. She wanted her own self-contained area, with more privacy, away from our guest room and frequent visitors.Friends thought we were mad and tried to dissuade us from what they thought of as a Faustian pact taking on too much responsibility – and proximity – in return for a bigger house. We were, they told us, setting ourselves up for nothing but trouble.Aware of the downsides, we canvassed all the alternatives, including buying a flat close by, or Mum moving in to a residential care facility, but she balked at both suggestions as too daunting, expensive, depressing and isolating.Despite our misgivings, we went ahead, hoping that the project would renovate our often fractious dynamic and that Mum’s oft-stated desire for her own space and the opportunity to cook her own meals would make explicit conversations about boundaries and expectations unnecessary. I always was an optimist.Her brief was for an inexpensive, spacious, well-insulated and light self-contained apartment with a kitchenette and sitting room, all reached via a stair chair.Once plans were drawn, we held the usual beauty pageant tendering process interviewing builders. Only one – the youngest, it turned out – understood, despite introductions, that Mum was the client and spoke directly to her. All the others assumed we were paying (wrong) and making the decisions (wrong).Despite making it very clear who the boss was, they pushed the plans across the table to us, in front of her, without acknowledging her in any way, their attitude demonstrating the lack of agency that is so common when it comes to care of elderly people: often unconsciously we decide for them, without asking them directly what they want. We give children endless opportunities to express preferences but deny our parents the same right. Understandably put out, she cast her vote accordingly, choosing manners over experience.As the project progressed, Mum visited showrooms and pored over brochures and samples to choose every fixture, fitting and finish. Always keen to try new things and realistic about her limitations, she had definite ideas, such as deciding that an induction cooktop would mean she would neither burn herself nor leave the gas or electricity on.Being French, she was used to a bidet as an essential item of personal hygiene, but having lost her balance, straddling one was no longer possible. Instead, she decided on the contemporary alternative: a premium-brand Japanese toilet with a washing function.She chose a hand-held shower to make washing herself easier and suggested raising power points to waist height to make them more accessible whether seated or standing. A fan of technology, she opted for a front-door cameraintercom system that meant she could hear the (extra loud) doorbell, see and speak to visitors via her iPad and let them in (or keep them out) without having to move more than a finger.The only modifications we made to her brief were to persuade her to add an undercover deck area for gentle exercise as recommended by her physio, and an overflow spare room that could, if necessary, be converted into a bedroom for a live-in carer, if illness required us to call on long-term additional support, giving her a total floor area of 84 sq m. Unwilling to consider future frailty and wary of strangers, she agreed reluctantly.The most frustrating setback related to her desire to have a non-slip vinyl floor in the bathroom, instead of ceramic tiles, dictated by her entirely reasonable fear of falling and knowledge of the stats: most falls occur in bathrooms where hard surfaces make them potentially more severe.It turns out that there are compliance standards for flooring installation. Maddeningly, these vary from state to state. Although it is used in hospitals, the non-slip vinyl my mother wanted could not be installed in her home. We moved out for the build. When we moved back in, she expressed surprise at how the plans translated into reality.“Oooh look, I’m cantilevered,” she exclaimed, amazed the the gravity defying engineering of the bathroom. “Won’t it collapse?” she asked, and avoided that end of the shower stall for days.As soon as she buckled herself in, it became clear that the stair chair was a triumph: safe, quiet, smooth and precision-engineered, it wrapped around the staircase with sinuous discretion, a far cheaper and less intrusive option than a lift. As she rises through the air on her mobile throne, Mum waves regally.After a few days mastering the many washing and drying functions on the remote, Mum pronounced the Japanese toilet “delightful”.Some things have not worked out as planned: the kitchenette is virtually unused, except for the microwave if we are away. We had lowered the benchtops to accommodate a wheelchair but, while unable to stand at the stove, Mum is not ready to accept the alternative. Her intention of cooking for herself has not become a reality she glides downstairs for every meal. We have regained some privacy, but not as much as we’d hoped: although she has her own TV upstairs, she prefers to watch in our company. The juliet balcony with sweeping ocean and escarpment views from her bedroom remains unused perhaps it’s a little too high for someone whose balance is precarious.Within months, Mum felt at home. We drew satisfaction from being within reach when needed, while reclaiming our spare room to welcome friends to stay. Even the sceptics are impressed. All of them want a ride on the stair chair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae78408689938bf0317cbc740debb89912e5ef46/561_293_3578_2147/master/3578.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=592500ff2c56b12dfb20da94aa23b873","title":"canine stars at crufts in pictures","story":"More than 26,000 dogs and 166,000 fans are expected over the four days of Crufts this year at the NEC in Birmingham.

She died a few years later, while still in her teens or early 20s.In 1885, workers renovating the parish church of St Mary and St Eanswythe close to Folkestone harbour found a lead container of human remains in an alcove – probably hidden to avoid the destruction of relics during the Reformation.The bones, which comprised about half of a skeleton, were assumed to belong to Eanswythe. But it was not until January this year, following a grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, that a team of experts set up a temporary laboratory in the church, which was closed for five days.Initial analysis suggested the bones were consistent with Eanswythe: they came from one person, probably female, probably aged between 17 and 20, and with no signs of malnutrition, so potentially a person with high status.A tooth and a foot bone were sent to Queen’s University Belfast for radiocarbon dating. The tests confirmed it was highly probable the person died in the mid-seventh century. Fears that the remains might be part of a medieval fad for fake relics were allayed.Andrew Richardson, of the Canterbury Archaeological Trust, said: “It was a brave move by the church. We could have come out and said: ‘Folks, it’s not her.’ I was 50-50 about it, and a lot of colleagues were sceptical. But everything is consistent with it being her.”He said the result of the analysis was of national significance. “It now looks probable that we have the only surviving remains of a member of the Kentish royal family, and one of the earliest Anglo-Saxon saints.“There is more work to be done to realise the full potential of this discovery. But certainly the project represents a wonderful conjunction not only of archaeology and history, but also of a continuous living faith tradition at Folkestone from the mid-seventh century to the present day.”Lesley Hardy, the director of the Finding Eanswythe Project at Canterbury Christ Church University, said: “Folkestone is an extremely ancient place but much of its heritage has been erased through development in the 19th and 20th centuries. Eanswythe was at the centre of the community – people would have seen her as a local hero. To bring her back into the light is something quite special.”The findings were revealed at an event at St Mary and St Eanswythe’s on Friday evening. Andrew Plested, a church warden, said: “Obviously it’s what we wanted to hear.” He said he expected the relics to lead to an increase in pilgrims to the church.Funds will now be sought for further scientific analysis of the bones – including establishing DNA – and to ensure they are securely housed and displayed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/403184e30843625d011703c3feb16b5e157fc3e8/0_332_3192_1915/master/3192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc0b234c72e3ace12257e09096039fdc","title":"scotland womens six nations game off player tests positive coronavirus","story":"Scotland’s match against France in the Women’s Six Nations on Saturday has been postponed after a member of the Scotland team tested positive for coronavirus, Scottish Rugby has announced.The Scottish women’s team returned from northern Italy on 23 February, after their match there was postponed.

The first major of the year, which Woods won in such sensational style in 2019, is now little over a month away.Mark Steinberg, Woods’s manager, issued a statement via ESPN on Friday evening as the deadline to enter the Players approached. “Back just not ready,” Steinberg said. “Not concerning long term, just not ready.” Nonetheless the long-term nature of Woods’s back problems means wider speculation is inevitable. Woods has undergone four surgeries on that area.“I have to listen to my body and properly rest when needed,” said Woods. “My back is simply just not ready for play next week.”The 44-year-old complained of rigidity in his back when finishing last among players who made the cut at the Genesis Invitational. “I feel stiff but I have weeks like that, especially in the cold mornings,” added Woods. “I don’t quite move as well and that’s just kind of how it’s going to go.”He subsequently skipped the WGC Mexico and this week’s Arnold Palmer Invitational, with the prevailing sense he would make a return to competitive action at the Players. Steinberg had previously claimed his client was “not quite ready” to participate in the Arnold Palmer. That fitness concerns have persisted will inevitably raise eyebrows. Woods is a two-time Players winner, with this year’s event carrying a record prize fund of $15m.Curiously Woods’s year had started reasonably well. He shared ninth at the Farmers Insurance Open and played his first nine of the Genesis in 31.Matters appeared to deteriorate thereafter, however. It now remains to be seen whether Woods is capable of playing tournament golf at all before the Masters. Should he opt to do so, the Valspar Championship from 19 March or the WGC Match Play the following week would come into the equation. The Masters tees off on 9 April.In maintaining an ominous theme, Jason Day withdrew from the Arnold Palmer Invitational midway through his second round, with a back injury the cause. Day was three over par for the tournament at the time of his latest departure. “Jason had some stiffness in his lower back on putting green before the round,” read a statement from the player’s management. “He tried to play through it but it stiffened up again later on the golf course.”Tyrrell Hatton, seeking a first win on the PGA Tour, is tied with Sung Kang at the top of the leaderboard after 36 holes. The pair are seven under, one clear of Danny Lee. Rory McIlroy’s 73 means he is two adrift at halfway. “I think if I shoot two scores in the 60s and get myself to double digits under par, I’ll have a really good chance,” said McIlroy.Phil Mickelson was among those to miss the cut on Friday at Bay Hill. Mickelson added a 72 to Thursday’s 77. “It was a really hard golf course and I enjoyed the challenge of trying to play in these type of conditions,” he said. “I’m a little frustrated that I haven’t gotten off to the start this year I would like but I’m not discouraged. I don’t feel like I’m that far off, but yesterday’s score was a little disappointing.”Mickelson subsequently appeared to aim a dig at McIlroy, who was forceful in his dismissal of the breakaway Premier Golf League plan. Mickelson’s interest in the scheme was endorsed by the playing of a pro-am in Saudi Arabia with some of the iniduals behind the ambitious project, which seeks to offer players an alternative and highly lucrative playing environment.“I wouldn’t come out and say I’m not going to do it right away ... and lose all your leverage,” Mickelson added.

So its revival, in the light of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepping back as senior working royals, has a certain contemporary resonance.The abdication of 1936 hangs over the play (we hear Edward’s radio broadcast and “crowds around the palace”), though the crowning of his brother, George VI, is not mentioned. Tension between brothers is central to the story here: Evelyn and Rupert Farrant are at war with each other.Tom York, best known as one of the Carne brothers in Poldark, plays both Evelyn, a camp, down-at-heel thespian, and Rupert, the richer, more respectable of the pair. One lives in dingy Soho and is forced to flirt with the landlady to stave off paying the rent the other has inherited the family fortune and lives a gentleman’s life.We meet Evelyn in the opening scene, persuading an ex-army major to murder Rupert. What follows is a kind of revolving-door farce with twins, dead bodies and a gun. York plays the brothers with gusto and there are some nifty manoeuvres that suggest both brothers are present on stage, even if we can see and hear the effort of the production team behind various curtains.But this cannot take away from the tepid humour as Corpse! seems to retreat into a nostalgic world of bygone Englishness. Evelyn goes to Fortnum \u0026amp Mason for lunch Rupert wears a smoking jacket and dines at his club. The production, directed by Clive Brill, seems like a melange of influences thrown together, from Hitchcock to Ealing comedy to Carry On.Stereotypes abound, from the none-too-bright Irish conman posing as an army man (Paul Kemp) to the lonely, lascivious landlady (Felicity Duncan). There are mannered references to performance and other in-jokes, engineered to appeal to a theatrical clique (“acting is a calling for people who don’t want to work,” says one actor). York is good at playing both the cad Evelyn and the upright-if-priggish Rupert. Beth Colley’s revolving set, showing the brothers’ respective households, is also appealing. But these features are not enough to save Corpse! as it limps to its deathly end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9aa83d2f32b1a217a9bdce084af8ba9264d29e01/0_405_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48afd14f2253a0352e2ab0dc0bba0289","title":"do you have a question about podcasts for our critic miranda sawyer","story":"The Observer’s audio critic is here to help find your perfect podcast.

He joined a group of alien chasers, but being a black Dominican among mostly white believers was challengingThe first time my dad ever heard someone talk about aliens and objetos volador no identificados, or UFOs, was when he was 13. One day in high school, an older student described a sighting to my dad. “The first thing I thought was, ‘This man looked like an alien to me!’ He was so out of the ordinary: blonde hair, white skin, blue eyes, in a sea of black bodies like mine,” my dad recalls being told.The talk with the older student validated a curiosity first sparked by a walk to school about five years prior. On an empty road in Cristo Rey, a lower-middle class, industrial neighborhood in Santo Domingo, a ball of light the size of a car tire appeared about 80 to 100 feet above him. It pulsated, moved steadily, horizontally, away from him, then vanished.“I was paralyzed for like 30 seconds. I didn’t understand what it was. I was so scared,” he told me. “I didn’t tell anyone because no one would have believed me.” He marks that day as one that changed him forever. “I started looking up all the time, looking at the sky,” he said.For my dad, a black teen growing up poor in the Dominican Republic, trying to learn everything he could about extraterrestrial life proved nearly impossible. There was no extra money to buy books, and no reliable public transportation to the Biblioteca Nacional Pedro Henríquez Ureña. Plus, his religious household – Seventh Day Adventists with a belief system that classified alcohol, tattoos, piercings, and rock music as satanic – inhibited him. “If you do something wrong, I would often hear, the devil is going to come for you,” he told me. “It made me fearful of being curious and asking questions.”But by 19, paychecks from his job at a bank allowed him to buy books on UFOs, aliens, the Bermuda Triangle. He watched local and international news, which is where he first learned about the alien abduction of Freddy Miller, who disappeared in Santo Domingo in 1959 and reappeared in 1973.It was not until his move to America in 1991, however, that my father’s curiosity – and by extension, my own – truly took root.Growing up in what I affectionately call the Segura Alien Household meant family trips to Barnes \u0026amp Noble to buy books on astronomy, physics, Area 51, and government cover-ups. By 11, I could discuss things like the reptilian conspiracy theory – which alleged that governments around the world were controlled by aliens disguised as humans – as easily as I could discuss Steely Dan, my father’s favorite band and the soundtrack to our reading and talking about outer space.Alien pictures my father drew and painted – aliens with white skin, long arms, black eyes, and a grimace creatures with pointed ears and fangs – lined the walls of our home. He drew an alien race with long arms and slanted eyebrows titled “the Pamelians” for my younger sister, Pamela, who, by age 13, was convinced she would be abducted by extraterrestrials it was only a matter of when.My dad would become so rapt watching the History Channel’s UFO Files and Ancient Aliens that my sister and I weren’t allowed to ask him questions until an episode was over. Still, I wondered: how many aliens exist? Where did they live? How did they live? Were they, like me, listening to their fathers talk about life beyond the world that they saw?It was during an episode of Ancient Aliens that my father first heard about the Mutual UFO Network, an organization of alien enthusiasts who study alleged UFO sightings.In 2015, he became a member. As a shy man, local chapter meetings never appealed to him, but as a truck driver on the road five to six days a week, whether in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania, or Charlotte, North Carolina, he connected to a hub of others who shared his unusual theories. It offered a refuge, company. Mufon allowed my dad to feel like he belonged, no matter where he was originally from.Then in 2018, Newsweek reported on a wave of resignations within Mufon after John Ventre – the state director for the organization’s Pennsylvania chapter, one of the largest in the country – posted on his personal Facebook that white men in America were being attacked by “illegal affirmative action” and “interracial couples in every show and commerical”. Despite apologizing the day after his post, Ventre resigned as state director. “I don’t hate anybody, I apologized for what I said” he told Newsweek. “I’m feeling like because I’m a 60-year-old white man I’m getting totally unfairly attacked here.”The fallout continued. Mufon board members and other chapter leaders resigned after learning of Mufon’s ties to JZ Knight, an author and New Age teacher, who, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, has made derogatory comments about Mexicans, LGBTQ people, Catholics, and Jews.“It’s very disappointing to me to hear about these people, and the organization should be more careful,” my dad told me. “But I’m not going to move away from a place where I am able to get access to a world that I love.”My father cherished the digital space this organization allotted him, and with my encouragement, was even considering attending local chapter meetings after he retired. But after learning about Ventre and Knight, I was worried. I wondered if Mufon was actually not safe, not a sanctuary, for a black man like him. So, I went to a meeting myself.Windsor Locks, Connecticut is two hours north of New York City and home to just under 13,000 people. The town, according to Mufon, has one of the highest numbers of reported UFO sightings in America. On a Saturday in February, I joined about 70 members – almost entirely white – at a pizzeria to discuss sightings that had occurred nearby, and hear a psychic talk about the secret space program called Solar Warden. “Solar Warden is a program based in Dahlgren, Virginia, run by the US navy that is responsible for monitoring all traffic in our solar system,” the psychic told us, as people around the table nodded knowingly. “It was developed in the 1960s and 70s and deployed by earth governments to protect Earth from hostile aliens.”Once the meeting was over, I wanted to talk to some members, many of whom have been attending for years. There was Pat, a woman in her 60s with bright red hair and married to another member, Mike. I met Mickey, an intense man who ranted about my iPhone giving me cancer and how aliens were, at that very moment, all around us. “Their technology is so advanced, we wouldn’t even be able to see them,” he said.And there was Geoffrey P Whittum, who calls himself “the Woods Walker” and believes that there is evidence of alien habitation in the forests of Connecticut. Although many were fervent in their attempts to convince me that the government was poisoning Americans through spacecraft – a common belief shared by all the members I talked with – not one of them seemed racist. They all seemed to enjoy gathering and creating a space where they could express their obscure thoughts about life beyond our world.After those initial greetings with members, I eventually worked up the nerve to ask everyone I talked with if they were familiar with Ventre and other allegations of racism within Mufon. They all said no. “Everyone is welcome here, no matter what you look like or believe,” Pat said.I left pleasantly surprised by the camaraderie I found. It felt almost spiritual. I wanted to return with my father to introduce him to a space that he has only known digitally but that proved more welcoming than I expected.On the ride back home to the Bronx, my thoughts about my father had become clear. I guess I’ve always known that he’s brilliant – he can play instruments, write songs, knows a lot about history, excels in math. Aliens are just one of the many facets of who he is. But what if he had arrived in America sooner – before marriage, before kids – and had the resources my sister and I enjoyed? Would he have been an astronomer? Written sci-fi? Worked for Nasa?That night, I told him about the Mufon meeting and the people I’d met. He seemed relieved and happy because there I was, over 50 years after he fell in love with space, enthusiastically rambling about government cover-ups, UFOs, and extraterrestrial life. “They’ve got a skywatch in the spring, and I’m invited,” I told him. “Let’s go and look up at the sky together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54d1e02cf6256db33c5dc7e13eafd9dabdba6109/0_303_4548_2729/master/4548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c6d3f9c6c8b8a56a37d90198180f015","title":"chinese schools reopen as coronavirus cases in europe continue to rise","story":"WHO calls on countries to make containing spread their highest priority, as Trump signs emergency spending billThe total number of coronavirus cases confirmed around the world passed 100,000 on Friday as Iran reported a sharp rise in cases and threatened to use force to stop people travelling between cities.Tehran’s announcement came as the World Health Organization called on countries to make “containment their highest priority” and Donald Trump signed a $8.3bn emergency spending bill to deal with the virus, despite insisting that it “will go away”.In Italy, Europe’s worst-affected country, the death toll rose by 46 to 197, and the number of confirmed cases increased by 778 to 4,636.Speaking at a televised press conference on Friday, a spokesman for Iran’s health ministry said the authorities had confirmed 4,747 cases of the virus, a rise of 1,234 on the day before. While he did not elaborate on the threat to use force, the spokesman acknowledged that the virus was present in all of Iran’s 31 provinces.The threat may be aimed at stopping people from using closed schools and universities as an excuse to go to the Caspian Sea and other holiday spots in the run-up to the Persian new year, which falls on 21 March.Semi-official news agencies in Iran posted images of long lines of traffic of people trying to reach the coast from Tehran on Friday despite authorities earlier telling people to remain in their cities.Checkpoints on roads in Mazandaran and Gilan provinces were being operated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in perhaps the most visible intervention by the state yet. There also appeared to be checks for those entering or leaving the holy city of Qom.Friday prayers and football matches have already been cancelled but public trust in the authorities’ capacity to deal with the virus had been undermined by the government’s sluggish and complacent initial response to the outbreak, and by the state’s secrecy over the killing of hundreds of street protesters in November.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.UK Chief Medical Officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland\u0026nbspChina, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and who is experiencing a cough or fever or shortness of breath to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 4 March, the\u0026nbspglobal death toll was 3,190, while\u0026nbspmore than 93,000 people have been infected\u0026nbspin more than 80 countries.The death toll has passed 3,000 in China, where there have been over 80,000 cases. South Korea, the nation worst hit by the outbreak outside China, has had 5,328 cases. More than 44,000 people in\u0026nbspChina\u0026nbsphave recovered from Covid-19.There have been 87 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK. There are 53 confirmed cases in Australia, with two deaths.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed outside China, but by no means in all 195 countries on the WHO’s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority of cases are travellers who picked up the virus in China.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has\u0026nbspdeclared the outbreak to be a public health emergency\u0026nbspof international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.Stung by criticism of its handling of the outbreak, Tehran has pointed to WHO assessments that have not challenged the government figures. Health officials said the new figures may reflect the availability of more accurate testing kits.In two further signs of rising concern about the situation in Iran, Christoph Hamelmann, the WHO country director, told senior overseas diplomats in Tehran that funding was urgently needed for a “rapid upscaling” of laboratory and clinical components, and Saudi Arabia called on citizens to declare visits to Iran in the past 14 days. Members of the kingdom’s Shia minority tend to keep their visits to Iran secret because of the bitter rivalry between the two countries.But at a briefing on Friday, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director general, praised Iran for “switching on” to the outbreak and for taking an “all-of-government approach”.Tedros said the epidemic was continuing to spread, adding: “We are continuing to recommend that all countries make containment their highest priority.”Elsewhere in the Middle East, 12 new cases were reported among workers on a cruise ship in Egypt. A tourist who travelled on the same ship sailing between Luxor and Aswan tested positive for the virus on her return to Taiwan a week ago.Across Europe there were significant rises in death tolls and infections. In France, where cases rose by 190 to 613, and deaths by two to nine, President Emmanuel Macron urged people to limit visits to elderly people, even though this could prove “heartbreaking” at times. The UK, meanwhile, reported what is believed to be its second death, and the Netherlands its first.Elsewhere, the first confirmed cases were reported in Costa Rica, Colombia, Cameroon, Togo, Serbia, Bhutan and Vatican City.As the outbreak continued to spread in the US, the Trump administration was forced on to the defensive following criticism of its approach to the virus. Fifteen people have died from the coronavirus there and more than 200 infections have been confirmed across at least 18 states.The president also said he believed the financial markets would “really bounce back” despite concerns that the virus was spreading beyond the control of governments around the world.Passengers on a large cruise ship off the California coast were instructed to stay in their cabins on Friday as they awaited test results that could determine whether the virus was circulating among the more than 3,500 people aboard.A military helicopter crew lowered test kits onto the Grand Princess by rope and later retrieved them for analysis at a lab as the vessel lay at sea off San Francisco, under orders to keep its distance from shore.Authorities undertook the testing after a passenger on a previous voyage of the ship died of the coronavirus and at least four others became infected.“The ship will not come on shore until we appropriately assess the passengers,” the Califorinia governor, Gavin Newsom, said.In Asia, a diplomatic row erupted between Japan and South Korea after Tokyo said it would quarantine all passengers arriving from the country, which has the highest number of cases outside China.From Saturday, anyone arriving in Japan from South Korea will be placed in a two-week quarantine at government-designated sites, the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said on Thursday.Seoul described the move as “unreasonable, excessive and extremely regrettable”, accusing Japan of failing to address its own outbreak properly, and threatening retaliatory measures.The International Olympic Committee and Tokyo 2020 organisers have insisted the Games will open as planned on 24 July, but speculation is growing that they will have to be cancelled.Meanwhile, schools in parts of China were set to reopen as the central province of Hubei – excluding the provincial capital Wuhan – reported no new cases of the coronavirus over the past 24 hours for the first time since the outbreak began last year.While Hubei reported no new cases for a full day, Wuhan, the centre of the epidemic, said it had confirmed 126 new cases of the virus on Thursday.Additional reporting by Lily Kuo in Hong Kong and Justin McCurry in Tokyo"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebf91c3056f38b3edf2134c5ab6e42cd176bf8e2/0_40_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26de6279e8ce706d3557627ff44d5971","title":"coronavirus facts what is the mortality rate and is there a cure covid 19","story":"Covid-19 essential guide: can it be caught on public transport, how is it different from the flu, and how sick will I get? The Covid-19 virus is a member of the coronavirus family that made the jump from animals to humans late last year. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city of Wuhan. Unusually for a virus that has made the jump from one species to another, it appears to transmit effectively in humans – current estimates show that without strong containment measures the average person who catches Covid-19 will pass it on to two others. The virus also appears to have a higher mortality rate than common illnesses such as seasonal flu. The combination of coronavirus’s ability to spread and cause serious illness has prompted many countries, including the UK, to introduce or plan extensive public health measures aimed at containing and limiting the impact of the epidemic.Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and do this often, including when you get home or into work. Use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available. Avoid touching your face. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or the crook of your elbow (not your hand) and put used tissues straight in the bin. Avoid close contact with people who are showing possible symptoms. Follow NHS guidance on self-isolation and travel.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.The coronavirus outbreak hit amid flu season in the northern hemisphere and even doctors can struggle to distinguish between the two – the overlap in symptoms probably contributed to slow detection of community infections in some countries, including Italy.If you have symptoms or think you might have been exposed to the virus when travelling or through other contacts, call the NHS 111 service or visit the online service, or contact the equivalent service in your country. Do not go to a GP, pharmacy or hospital.Most infections happen in families, where people live at close quarters. You need to be within one to two metres of somebody to be infected by viral-loaded water droplets from their coughs or when they are speaking. That is less likely on public transport. However, it would be possible to pick up the virus on your hands from a surface that somebody with the infection had touched. The virus can linger for 48 hours or even possibly 72 hours on a hard surface, such as the hand rail in the tube – though less time on a soft surface. That is why the advice is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face, to prevent the virus getting into your nose, mouth or eyes.Not at the moment, but drugs that are known to work against some viruses are being trialled in China, where there are thousands of patients, and new trials are starting in the US and other countries. Large numbers are needed to find out whether they work in a few people or a lot of people or nobody at all. The most hopeful are Kaletra, which is a combination of two anti-HIV drugs, and remdesivir, which was tried but failed in Ebola patients in west Africa in 2013 and 2016. Some Chinese doctors are also trying chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, which is off-patent, therefore cheap and highly available, and would be very useful in low-income countries. The first results are expected in mid-March and should indicate if the drugs will at least help those who are most severely ill. A miracle cure is not expected.Efforts to develop an effective vaccine for Covid-19 have been quick compared with historical epidemics, such as Ebola. A number of teams are already testing vaccine candidates in animals and preparing to carry out small trials in people. The US company, Moderna Therapeutics, is already recruiting and hopes to enrol 45 volunteers between 18 and 55 and launch the trial by the end of April. Phase one trials like this look at whether the vaccine triggers an immune response and whether the given dose causes adverse effects and could be completed quite quickly. However, the subsequent phases, which will involve thousands of volunteers and will look more closely at efficacy, will take longer and obtaining a commercially available vaccine within a year would be extremely quick. The government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he did not think a working vaccine to protect people from the coronavirus would be produced in time for the current outbreak, but that a timeframe of a year or 18 months “was not unreasonable to assume”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59c739560c67d5c36913b54ef4704b58e641da13/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5636d2bce2191a23354311b4999df1b5","title":"coronavirus symptoms what is covid 19 wuhan doctor","story":"What is coronavirus, how does it spread, what are the symptoms, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before.

Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a8aaa203ddc0e9806cd07eaed10036ccf365801/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc3779ba51ee22a5aee63f435d728def 465w","title":"this is surreal italian towns struggle under coronavirus lockdown","story":"Doctors unable to visit patients while some who have recovered say they are still stigmatisedQuarantined Italian towns are buckling under the strain, major cities are emptying out and some of those infected say they are being stigmatised as Europe’s worst outbreak of coronavirus takes hold.As of Friday night, 4,636 cases had been detected as Italy aggressively tests for the virus. Out of that number, 197 people have died.Eleven towns are under lockdown – 10 in Lombardy and one in Veneto – and schools have been closed across the country as the government tries to contain a virus about which there are still many unknowns.Its neighbour Austria announced it is introducing “spot” health checks at the border for two weeks as of next week.Stories that have emerged since the outbreak began reflect the contrasting nature of the virus’s impact, from the reassuring accounts of people cured to the suffering of those who have died or are in a critical condition. The heavily pregnant wife of “patient one”, the 38-year-old man who was Italy’s first confirmed locally transmitted case, was dismissed from hospital on Thursday her husband, a marathon runner and amateur footballer, remains in intensive care.The dead, mostly elderly and with underlying health problems, are buried quickly without ceremony to mitigate the risk of infection posed by their corpses. The living have become wary of those with even the slightest cough.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.Nowhere is the situation more acute than in the areas under quarantine. In Castiglione d’Adda, a town of 4,600 in Lombardy, 18 people have died within the past two weeks and, as of Thursday, 121 inhabitants were infected. The youngest victim was a 55-year-old man it is unclear whether he had an underlying illness. With three of the town’s five doctors in quarantine and two hospitalised with the virus, there is nobody to tend to the sick at home.“We have many people with a fever who are at home and who are unable to be visited by a doctor,” Costantino Pesatori, the mayor of Castiglione d’Adda, told the . “A substitute doctor came but he wasn’t provided with protective clothing and so, justifiably, refused to see people at home.”Pesatori is yet to learn whether the 14-day quarantine period, due to end on Sunday, will be extended. “This is such a surreal situation as the virus is difficult to comprehend it’s like living in a film,” he said. “People are also getting fed up of staying at home and some are starting to break the quarantine rules.”Stefano Lovisetto, a 58-year-old from Vo’ Euganeo, the only quarantined town in Veneto, was dismissed from hospital on Monday after being given the all-clear.“I had no symptoms, not even a cough,” he said. “People are saying this is the plague, but it isn’t. At least for me, it was only slightly more aggressive than a normal flu. The hospital staff were so kind and reassuring, despite having to deal with so many cases.”Morena Colombi, 59, is also among the recovered, but said she was being treated by fellow inhabitants in Truccazzano, a town of almost 6,000 near Milan, as if she had the plague. Colombi is the only confirmed case in the town, which is not under lockdown.“They are speaking badly about me, it’s as if I did a robbery or something,” she said. “But all it is is a virus that just so happened to affect me. When people hear the words ‘virus’ or ‘quarantine’ and ‘there is no cure’ they get frightened. For me, I had hardly any symptoms. Others are suffering badly, but most of those have other pathologies.”With 2,008 confirmed cases as of Friday, Lombardy is the worst-affected region, followed by Emilia-Romagna (816) and Veneto (454). The number of those infected across Italy’s other 17 regions so far totals 638. Italy has so far tested 36,359 people.Beyond the outbreak zones, everyday life has also changed dramatically. Venice, usually overflowing with tourists, is empty. As are the normally busy shops, bars and restaurants in Milan and Rome. Holidaymakers have cancelled trips and several airlines suspended flights amid warnings the tourism sector could suffer €7.4bn of losses. All major sporting events, including Serie A football, will be played behind closed doors until 3 April.“There’s no tourism,” said Simona Susanu, who works in a bar close to the Trevi fountain. “You only have to see how empty it is around the fountain to understand what is happening.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb42d0a9a221c7d10217dd9cb6f75b1ec8c959a8/0_198_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b3997b27a292622d993deacc93c7f8a","title":"good thing for small packages tiny homes movement wins big in new zealand","story":"Owner of a home that measures just 8m by 3m wins high profile three-year legal battle with government over rates and regulationsYachts and caravans have all served as home for Alan Dall but it is his tiny house in Canterbury that has finally claimed his heart and where he’s firmly put down roots after 25 years of transient living.Measuring just eight metres long and three metres wide, Dall’s tiny home has become something of an inspiration for the movement, with his fight to retain its status potentially having lasting ramifications around the country.Dall, originally from Scotland, has been engaged in a high-profile legal battle with government and the local council for three years, after the council classified his tiny house a building, making it subject to the same building codes and consents as standard homes.Dall appealed to the ministry of business, innovation and finance (MBIE) but it backed the council’s decision that the “house” must comply with the building code or face being demolished.Determined not to lose his first-ever permanent home, built with his own hands, Dall took his fight to the Christchurch district court at a cost of around NZ$10,000 and last week Judge Callaghan ruled in his favour. The ruling could set a precedent as dozens of other tiny home owners around the country are engaged in similar disputes.“Don’t get me wrong, I would love to be able to buy a house but at 56 years old I think I’ve missed the boat on that,” Dall said.“I’ve had so many emails from people saying ‘thank you, thank you, we feel a bit safer now’. I’ve also heard of some of the councils backing off, though others are still going hard at it.”As the housing crisis deepens in New Zealand, owners of alternative, low-cost homes say an overhaul of regulations is urgently needed, as many people interested in downsizing and lowering their carbon footprint have been “scared off” by legal battles.Others, for whom tiny houses are their only affordable option, are experiencing stress and anxiety at the prospect of losing their home.“The mental and physical stress has been huge,” Dall said. “It’s really taken a toll”According to a recent Demographia International survey, New Zealand has one of the most unaffordable housing markets in the world. Over the past decade homelessness – defined in the country as “having no other options to acquire safe and secure housing” – has increased to more than 40,000 or one in 100 New Zealanders. Working families are also now feeling the bite, with some forced to sleep in cars, tents and shipping containers despite being in full-time employment.The Green party MP Gareth Hughes said the rate of council evictions from tiny houses was rising as they increased in popularity, and evicting anyone in the midst of a housing crisis made no sense.Hughes has visited Dall’s tiny house and said his court victory was “significant” clarifying the situation for others.“It has increasingly become an issue of concern. Tiny homes are a grey area and I think that’s the problem, they’re stuck between transport and building standards codes,” Hughes said.“We need stand-alone tiny house rules, particularly for relocatable buildings. We also need to modernise our land use rules, people are wanting more flexibility, and we should be open towards that in the middle of a housing crisis.”“In a housing crisis it doesn’t make sense to be threatening people with eviction notices and potentially put them on to the street or into cars.”There are no clear figures on how many tiny homes exist in New Zealand as many people keep them under the radar – for fear of persecution, or because the landowners hosting them might be slapped with fines in the tens of thousands of dollars.Colin Wightman, who builds tiny houses for Eco Cottages, said New Zealand had its “head in the sand” about alternative housing. “While the government pretends they want to innovate for affordable housing, they are actually working against it and exacerbating the homeless problem themselves,” said Wightman, who plays an advocacy role for tiny house owners.Wightman said the industry and owners wanted tiny homes to “have our own set of rules and regulations that maintain minimum standards”, similar to legislation enacted in the UK and the US where the tiny house movement is flourishing.“I’m at the coalface of homelessness. I have people coming to me and crying on my shoulders,” said Wightman, adding that the popularity of the movement had stalled in New Zealand with many now “scared off”.A recent visit by the UN special rapporteur on adequate housing, Leilani Farha, said that while the government was sincere in its efforts to tackle the housing crisis, it was lacking creativity and urgency. “I’ve seen and heard a lot of interesting and thoughtful policies, but I think what remains to be seen here is courageous acts, creative measures, and structural change,” Farha said. “In terms of innovation, I just didn’t get a feeling that really creative ideas were being explored. It’s a little bit same-old, same-old.”For Dall the court case has taken a real strain and he is now looking forward to finally enjoying his home, without the looming threat of eviction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c64159171038b3bdd957d444ad8d36057fc633a/0_39_1860_1117/master/1860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=324c877008364c559902c8e974156db0","title":"saudi arabia detains three royal family members in latest crackdown","story":"Royal relatives accused of plotting to oust King Salman and successor Crown Prince Mohammed bin SalmanSaudi authorities have detained three royal family members including two senior princes, according to US media reports, signalling the crown prince is further tightening his grip on power.Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, a brother of King Salman, and the monarch’s nephew Prince Mohammed bin Nayef were taken from their homes early on Friday by royal guards after being accused of treason, the Wall Street Journal reported citing unnamed sources. The pair were allegedly plotting to oust King Salman and the son he has designated to succeed him, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, it reported.The New York Times also reported the detentions, adding that Prince Nayef’s younger brother Prince Nawaf bin Nayef had also been detained.Saudi authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The detentions mark the latest crackdown by the de facto ruler crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has consolidated his reign with the imprisonment of prominent clerics and activists as well as princes and business elites.The crown prince, the king’s son, has also faced a torrent of international condemnation over the murder of critic Jamal Khashoggi inside the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate in October 2018.Prince Ahmed, said to be in his 70s, had returned to the kingdom from his base in London in the aftermath of the Khashoggi scandal, in what some saw as an effort to shore up support for the monarchy.In June 2017, the crown prince had edged out Prince Nayef, the former crown prince and interior minister, to become heir to the Arab world’s most powerful throne.At the time, Saudi television channels showed the crown prince kissing the hand of the older prince and kneeling before him in a show of reverence.Western media reports later said that the deposed prince had been placed under house arrest, a claim strongly denied by Saudi authorities.“Prince Mohammed is emboldened – he has already ousted any threats to his rise and jailed or murdered critics of his regime without any repercussion,” Becca Wasser, a policy analyst at the US-based Rand Corporation, said of the latest crackdown.“This is a further step to shore up his power and a message to anyone – including royals – not to cross him.”The detentions come at a sensitive time as Saudi Arabia bars Muslim pilgrims from Islam’s holiest sites to contain the coronavirus outbreak.The kingdom has suspended the “umrah” year-round pilgrimage over fears of the disease spreading to Mecca and Medina, raising uncertainty over the upcoming hajj – a key pillar of Islam.The oil-rich kingdom is also grappling with plunging price of crude, its major source of revenue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26cba6646f093e2193b239694358fd55d15bb29f/0_425_6378_3827/master/6378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83aee862ba068fa2f301b85dcde05d28","title":"coronavirus update latest live news symptoms cases global infection rate uk usa australia italy china updates","story":"Doctor likely fell ill in the US before flying back to Melbourne and treating 70 patients, says Victoria’s health ministerHelen Sullivan here, head over at our new blog below, where I’ll be liveblogging the very latest coronavirus news for the next while.In Australia, here is the latest on the story of a Victoria doctor who treated 70 patients despite having flu-like symptoms, and who has now be confirmed as the latest case of coronavirus in the state. Victorian health authorities are trying to contact about 70 patients of a Melbourne doctor who has developed coronavirus after returning from the USThe doctor is the state’s 11th case of the novel coronavirus and the state health minister, Jenny Mikakos, says he attended work and treated patients after her was symptomatic.“I have to say I am flabbergasted that a doctor that has flulike symptoms has presented to work,” Mikakos said.The doctor returned from the US on 29 February and saw approximately 70 patients last week between Monday 2 March and Friday 6 March at the Toorak Clinic on Malvern Road. The clinic has been since closed.Patients have been contacted by text message, phone or email and two patients the doctor treated in a Malvern nursing home have been isolated.All patients the doctor saw and all clinic staff have been asked to self-isolate for 14 days. The clinic’s other patients have been asked to monitor their symptoms.Passengers on the flight with the doctor would be contacted, Mikakos said.We have the latest figures for China now.Mainland China had 99 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections on Friday, the country’s National Health Commission said on Saturday, down from 143 cases a day earlier. That brings the total accumulated number of confirmed cases in mainland China so far to 80,651. The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China was 3,070 as of the end of Friday, up by 28 from the previous day. The central province of Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak, reported 28 new deaths. In the provincial capital of Wuhan, 21 people died.Regarding the confirmed coronavirus case who attended a Tool concert in New Zealand, all attendees who were in general admission at the concert have now been contacted by the event organisers. Only those who have any symptoms should call the country’s health line says New Zealand Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield. Soon, he adds, the public will see notices up in bus shelters and other public places regarding advice for preventing the transmission of the virus. New Zealand Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield says that of the eight New Zealanders who were on board the Grand Princess, the cruise ship quarantined off the coast of San Fransisco, five are well following the two-week period during which people should display symptoms. One is a seventy-year-old woman, who has recovered from a respiratory illness. Her Covid-18 test result has since come back negative, although the had been thought to be a probable case.New Zealand Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield says most human-to-human transmission there is happening within families. In New Zealand, the fifth positive case is a woman in her 40s, the partner of the third case confirmed earlier this week. Regarding the latest case in Victoria, Australia, a doctor who treated 70 patients after showing flu-like symptoms – he is now a confirmed case of Covid-19, Dr Sutton, the state’s chief health officer is asked: How worried are you that given that the doctor was treating this patient in close proximity, that we will have more cases of coronavirus?We need to be alert to the possibility, that is why would be monitoring them on a daily basis. All of them have been contacted en masse this morning, they will be called again through the course of today. They will be isolated and with respect to the ongoing risk from them in developing illness, we can manage that, but yes, we have to be alert to the possibility of developing illness.Still in Australia: asked whether he would extend that travel advice to the general public, state chief health officer Dr. Sutton says: I think everyone needs to give consideration to information that is important to them. People have family around the world, people have different risk tolerance. But people should look at the WHO website...It does depend on if you are in a vulnerable and high-risk age group, it does depend on who you are travelling with, how long you will be there for, and the extent to which you can protect yourself in terms of from others.There are lots of complex things at play. For the Department of education they needed a definitive statement, but for everyone else, you need to look at all the information and make a judgement for yourself. In Victoria, Australia: state chief health officer Dr. Sutton says, regarding students, “there may come a point where we say no international travel at all...at the moment my recommendation is to restrict travel to New Zealand and Canada.” In Australia, Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos says the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity is working on a more efficient test for Covid-19.They are working on a far more quick test. So at the moment it takes about three hours from the time that the swab sample arrives to get a result, and the travel time getting it there does add to the turnaround. They are looking at potentially a pin blood test that could mean that we could get a test result within 20 minutes.In Australia, Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos is addressing the media regarding the latest coronavirus case in the state, its eleventh, which is a medical doctor who treated seventy patients despite experiencing flu-like symptoms. Still in Victoria, Australia, just a bit more on this doctor. He is the latest confirmed case: The latest case is a doctor from Toorak in his 70s, who displayed mild symptoms on a flight from the United States. He is now recovering in home isolation. It was confirmed positive last night following a series of tests. The doctor recently travelled to Denver and Bali Colorado, via LosAngeles, and was there for several days before onset. He most likely acquired his infection in the UnitedStates. He became unwell with a runny nose on an internal flight from Denver to San Francisco onFebruary 27, US time, then flew from San Francisco to Melbourne on a United Airlines flight, arriving at approximately 9:30am Saturday the 29 February. The doctor, from the Toorak clinic in Malvern Road consulted approximately 70 patients for five days, between Monday the 2 March and Friday the 6 March.In Victoria, Australia, state chief health officer Dr. Sutton says at this stage people “can and should go ahead” attending mass gatherings, so long as they don’t have symptoms. Victoria’s chief health officer Dr. Brett Sutton speaking now. Health workers “have a particular obligation to exclude yourself from work if you are unwell”. In Australia, Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos says she is “flabbergasted” that a doctor who had flulike symptoms presented to work in the state this week. She sats the ministry will be reminding doctors across the state not to present to work should they display any symptoms. The doctor in question came into contact with around 70 patients.

Australia is entering its winter season, so the government will be watching that closely, he says.In Canberra, Australia Prof. Kelly says over the longer term there is a “range of possibilities that may take place. We may be able to take it under control but that’s looking increasingly unlikely... it may become endemic, so something that comes back around each winter.” We’re still in Canberra, Australia for the moment, where deputy chief medical officer Prof. Paul Kelly is giving a general update on the status of preparations for managing the spread of the virus. Professor Kelly says Australia is offering support to Indonesia for testing and other control measures for the coronavirus outbreak. In Canberra, Australia, deputy chief medical officer Prof. Paul Kelly says the government is considering stockpiling some antibiotics and antivirals to a stockpile, though none of either type of pharmaceutical have been proved to be effective against coronavirus.In Canberra, Australia we’re hearing more from the Department of Health on the Melbourne doctor who treated 70 patients despite exhibiting flu-like symptoms. The general principle is, as it is in flu season, “Don’t soldier on...and we expect our health care workforce particularly to take this onboard,” deputy chief medical officer Professor Paul Kelly says. In Australia, 260,000 masks are to be released from stockpile, authorities say. We’ll have more updates shortly. China’s exports plummeted in the first two months of this year on the back of a coronavirus epidemic that forced businesses to suspend operations, disrupting the world’s supply chains.Exports fell 17.2 percent, the biggest drop since February 2019 during the trade war with the United States, and imports dropped 4 percent, according to official data released Saturday.China’s trade surplus with the US - a key point of contention in the trade dispute between the two countries - plunged 40 percent in the first two months, from US$42 billion last year to US$25.4 billion.Chinese authorities said last month that January and February’s data would be combined.This is in line with how some other indicators are released, to smooth over distortions from the Lunar New Year break.In an early sign of the economic impact to come, China’s manufacturing activity fell to its lowest level on record in February, with non-manufacturing activity plummeting as well.Florida Health Department says in statement that two people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died in the state, Associated Press reports. The deaths are the first on the East Coast, according to the New York Times.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4195525.1583521452!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus and elderly there is no point in worrying what can we do","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMaureen Daly at home in Arigna, Co Roscommon: “When everything clears away, I’d like to go back to the centre because we are like a big family.” Photograph: Brian FarrellMaureen Daly from Arigna, Co Roscommon, celebrated her 94th birthday last week, but concern over coronavirus has lately kept her from her “lifeline” in the local day centre.“I am old and I am sick and they say it’s more dangerous for those with underlying health conditions,” she says. Maureen was diagnosed with lymphoma six years ago and while she is in remission she says she has other health issues.“When everything clears away I’d like to go back to the centre because we are like a big family and I miss them and I miss Julie. She listens to all of our problems.”Julie Dockery is the manager of Keadue social services which operates a day centre attended by up to 20 people who get a homecooked four-course dinner in the middle of the day (bacon and cabbage is a favourite). Cook Pauline Regan also has tea and freshly baked scones or treacle bread ready when they arrive.They also deliver dinner every day to many people in the area including former miner Pat Lynch (93). He has lived alone near Lough Allen since the death of his wife 14 years ago .Dockery worries about the implications if the virus spreads, and services for people like Pat are curtailed.Dinner delivery“If the worst came to the worst we could leave it outside the house in a box but I hope it does not come to that” she says. While Pat has a son living close by who visits every day, she says some people living in isolated rural areas see no one from morning to night except the driver delivering dinner .“I can’t tell you how many times we have discovered someone lying on the floor or someone who is ill ,” she explained.Lynch used to work in the Arigna coal mines and has “a bit of dust on the lung” but he isn’t fretting too much about the coronavirus, and says: “I’m not worried although I’d sooner not hear anything about it.”“A lot of the men live on their own. It can be lonely. They open up a lot when they come in,” says Dockery.“There’s always a buzz,” she says and there’s usually bingo, card games or classes in pottery and art.Dockery has hand-sanitiser strategically placed throughout the hall and says she has been like a mother hen all week “running after people” with the sanitiser. She has also been delivering lectures about “surgical” hand washing rather than just a quick splash under a cold tap.On Thursday morning after confirmation of four cases west of the Shannon, nobody in the centre was panicking.“It’s getting nearer,” laughed Phil Cooney (86) from Ballyfarnan, Co Roscommon. “But there is no point in worrying. What can we do about it?” asks the regular attender who still drives.Sars ‘hullabaloo’She conceded she might stop going to “bigger towns” if Covid-19 does spread, but is adamant that for now she would not even consider staying away from Mass or funerals.Bridie Mora, Drumboylan, also says there’s no need to overreact. “It is being blown out of proportion. There was a hullabaloo about Sars before. We have no contact outside our own little circle so for now I don’t think we should worry.”There was a chorus of surprise when Mia Etheridge who lives in Drumshanbo admitted she was worried but hoping “common sense” would protect them.Dockery knows how vulnerable people of a certain age can be but she knew that long before she heard of the coronavirus. Over the winter the centre lost a number of people who died after contracting flu and “succumbed to conditions like pneumonia and pleurisy”.“So when something like this comes along, you do worry,” she says. Some of those who died this winter had been battling serious health issues but when Dockery heard that four cases had been identified in the west she thought “Oh God, now it’s getting more serious”.Now she feels it’s “a waiting game” and all she can do is enforce whatever guidelines the HSE passes on and hope that the service can stay open.She is heartened by the attitude of the people who attend the centre. “I have to say this group are very laid-back. They are not getting too excited.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4195102.1583528327!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus ireland five new cases confirmed in republic","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSigns at the entrance to Cork University Hospital.

The country the man travelled to Ireland from is not one of the high-risk areas and the case is still under investigation.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan Holohan described 18 as “a small number of cases” and pointed out that all but one could be explained in terms of its origins.The process of identifying contacts of the cases was working well he added.“We are still in a containment phase and the change of picking up this disease remains very low.”He said he would be concerned if some recommendations “happened sooner than appropriate” as this might make it more difficult for the public to understand.A fourth case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the North by the UK Department of Health on Friday night.Speaking in Brussels earlier today, Minister for Health Simon Harris said Ireland was “actively preparing” for more cases of the disease, on top of the 13 already confirmed on Thursday.Mr Harris criticised profiteering on essential drugs and equipment needed to combat the spread of coronavirus.Mr Harris said anyone sought to profiteer by hiking up the prices of items such as hand sanitisers that the public need deserved “special condemnation”.He also condemned those “who deliberately spread lies” about the virus and said they were endangering the lives of people and needed to be “called out”.Mass gatheringsEarlier on Friday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said there are no plans as of now to cancel any mass gatherings due to concerns over coronavirus.Mr Varadkar said that Ireland remained in the containment phase in dealing with the virus, and said he expected that there will be more cases in Ireland.Mr Varadkar said: “Detailed guidance is being issued today on events and mass gatherings. We are not recommending at this stage that any major events be cancelled but that of course will be kept under review.“We do expect that there will be more cases in the coming days, weeks and months and it is inevitable that many people will contract Covid 19 but for the vast majority of people it will be a mild illness. However, some will become very sick.”The Taoiseach also said the Government has authorised the HSE to open extra beds in intensive care.“As of now, nobody has needed an ICU bed yet but obviously additional ICU beds will be made available and also additional capacity for isolation as needed, and also discussions underway with private hospitals to use their capacity too.”“What we may have to do is ask people who are retired healthcare professionals to come back into service if there are significant pressures on our health service in the weeks ahead.”He also said there would be a “clear solution” next week on income supports for those who need to self isolate.Meanwhile, the Irish embassy in France has cancelled its St Patrick’s Day reception, a major annual event with hundreds of invited guests.HospitalsMore than 60 staff at Cork University Hospital (CUH) have been asked to self-isolate following a case of coronavirus at the hospital that was a result of community transmission.A man who was diagnosed with coronavirus in Cork had been in CUH for up to a week and may have had contact with large numbers of staff and sick patients, before he was tested.The case is one of 13 which have been confirmed in the Republic. Seven cases were reported by Thursday night, more than doubling the previous number. There have been three cases confirmed in Northern Ireland and more are expected by the day.A joint statement released by the UL Hospitals Group, HSE MidWest Community Healthcare, and HSE Public Health MidWest, said authorities were working to trace contacts of the four people, who are currently in isolation at the hospital and who are “receiving appropriate care”.The group has also imposed visitor restrictions at University Hospital Limerick, University Maternity Hospital Limerick, St John’s Hospital, Croom Orthopaedic Hospital in Co Limerick Nenagh Hospital in Co Tipperary and Ennis Hospital in Co Clare.Appropriate stepsTrinity College Dublin told staff and students on Thursday night it had been informed of a case within the university.The university and HSE will take “appropriate steps” to contain the further spread of the virus, the email said.Trinity confirmed that the university would remain “open and operating as normal”, with the relevant section of the campus – the fourth floor of the Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute and the building’s lifts – closed as a precaution.The HSE will trace those who were in contact with the inidual, according to the email. The university said it would work closely with authorities to ensure the inidual receives the best possible care.At-risk areasAmid growing concern in the health service over the depletion of staff because of the virus, health officials were due to meet on Friday to see how the gaps can be plugged.The rules in relation to healthcare workers returning from at-risk areas abroad were changed on Wednesday, it emerged on Thursday night. Before this, staff coming back from Italy did not have to self-isolate unless they had been in one of 11 quarantined Italian towns now, they must stay at home for 14 days if they have been anywhere in northern Italy.HSE chief executive Paul Reid said 25 new intensive care beds are to be opened at a cost of €25 million to ease the pressure on the health service. An information campaign aimed at raising public awareness of protecting against the virus is also set to begin shortly.Despite the increase in cases, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said he was not alarmed: “This is what we would have anticipated. It matches the pattern of most other countries’ experience.”The number of cases was “still small” and officials were confident they can prevent significant further transmission, he told the daily briefing of the National Public Health Emergency Team.Other than the case in Cork, he said, public health officials could explain how the patients involved were infected.Despite the surge in cases related to travellers returning from Italy, he said there were no plans to introduce a travel ban for any region.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4195177.1583526499!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus timeline the cases confirmed in ireland so far","story":"The number of coronavirus cases is due to increase in Ireland.

Photograph: Wei Leng TayBloombergAs the number of global coronavirus cases approaches 100,000, the number of confirmed cases in the Republic had more than doubled by Friday, bringing the total to 18, along with four others in Northern Ireland.Here is a timeline of the confirmed cases:Saturday, February 29thThe first confirmed case of the coronavirus in Ireland was announced by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Saturday night. It followed another case confirmed in Northern Ireland earlier in the week.The teenager had become ill after returning from Italy and was placed in isolation in a Dublin hospital.Sunday, March 1stA north Dublin school with 400 pupils announced on Sunday it would close for two weeks after one of its students was confirmed as having the coronavirus. Public health officials order the closure as a precautionary measure and to minimise the risk of person-to-person transmission of the disease.Tuesday, March 3rdThe second case of the coronavirus in the Republic was confirmed on Tuesday evening after a woman who had recently travelled from Italy tested positive.Wednesday, March 4thOn Wednesday, it was confirmed that a family of four in Co Clare had tested positive for the virus after returning from a skiing holiday in northern Italy.One of the family members, a healthcare professional, had worked in University Hospital Limerick’s emergency department before being diagnosed nine days after returning from the holiday. Efforts to trace people who came into contact with the four people are ongoing.These include patients who attended the minor injuries zone of the hospital’s emergency department between 10am and 2pm on Wednesday, February 26th.The hospital closed for three hours on Wednesday for a deep clean and patients were directed to other hospitals.These cases, the first cluster of positive tests in the Republic, forced the closure of three schools in Co Clare as a precautionary measure.Northern Ireland also reported two new cases on Wednesday, one of them a student from Queen’s University, bringing to three the total number of cases in the North. Neither of the two new cases in the North involved travel through the Republic.One of those who tested positive had travelled from northern Italy while the other had recent contact with a person elsewhere in the UK who had subsequently tested positive for Covid-19, said the North’s health minister Robin Swann.Thursday, March 5thOn Thursday evening, the Provost of Trinity College Dublin sent an email to its 17,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students and about 2,600 staff members informing them that a positive case of Covid-19 had been confirmed “within” the university.Another three new cases of the virus were confirmed among men from the east of the country who had recently travelled from Italy.Two women who were connected to the cases reported in Co Clare earlier in the week also tested positive.A man who had been in Cork University Hospital (CUH) for up to a week was also diagnosed. It is understood the man, who received treatment in the hospital last week and was discharged, may have had contact with a large number of staff and sick patients before he was tested. However, it is not clear how he came into contact with the virus.CUH has cancelled elective surgeries and imposed visitor restrictions along with the clearance of further space for isolating patients. The patient is receiving intensive care in an isolation unit at the hospital.Just prior to this announcement in the Republic, a fourth case was confirmed in the North by the UK Department of Health.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4195611.1583533076!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus testing to rise sharply as treatment streamlined","story":"The number of coronavirus cases is due to increase in Ireland.

Photograph: Michael CooperPA WireThe testing of people for coronavirus and the treatment of confirmed cases is to be streamlined as the number of Covid-19 diagnoses continues to rise here.Another five positive tests for the disease – three women and two men – were announced last night, with Northern Ireland also recording another case.This brings to 18 the number of confirmed cases of the virus in the Republic and four in the North.It is planned that patients with mild symptoms will recover in isolation in the community, rather than in hospital, where all cases are being treated at present.International data shows four out of every five people who get the disease suffer mild symptoms. The number of people infected with coronavirus is nearing 100,000 across the globe, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday.Staff at some Irish hospitals will be be trained to provide testing facilities regionally, it is expected. The National Virus Reference Laboratory in University College Dublin currently processes all tests. Up to last week, almost 400 people had been tested, but this number is expected to have risen sharply when new figures are published early next week.Other health service staff are to be drafted in to assist the 60 or so public health professionals who specialise in tracing contacts of people with infectious diseases. The requirement for contact tracing has escalated hugely since the number of cases grew in recent days.Three of the new cases in the Republic are in the south of the country, one is in the east and one in the west.One case is associated with travel from northern Italy, and one with close contact with a confirmed case. A third case involves a healthcare worker who was in close contact with a confirmed case.The last two new cases involve a male who travelled from abroad and a female who travelled from northern Italy.

Private nursing homes across the State have also restricted visiting to minimise risk to “vulnerable” older residents.Trinity College Dublin, which has one confirmed case among its student body, has introduced a ban on entering the college for 14 days for staff and students returning from northern Italy or other high-risk areas.Ireland’s fifth round Six Nations clash away to France on March 14th will go ahead, the French Rugby Federation confirmed. Organisers of the St Patrick’s Day parade in Youghal, Co Cork announced their decision to cancel this year’s event.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar urged people “not to act unilaterally, whether that is crèche owners or business owners or event organisers”. “We need to act in concert, and if the response needs to be escalated we should escalate it altogether.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4195555.1583526269!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"greens push for ryan to be taoiseach for one year in three way coalition","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan: senior party figures  say the leaders of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael   should get two years each as taoiseach and  Ryan get one.   Photograph: Getty ImagesGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan should be taoiseach for one year of a five-year coalition between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens, senior figures in that party have said.Fine Gael has repeatedly said its party, if it enters into coalition with Fianna Fáil, will require the taoiseach’s position to be rotated between Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and Fine Gael’s Leo Varadkar. Mr Martin this week confirmed he would go into government with Fine Gael, subject to agreement on policies, and did not rule out rotating the office of taoiseach. Fine Gael’s position is that it wants to go into opposition, but has not ruled out entering government with Fianna Fáil as a last resort.Although government-formation talks have yet to make any substantial progress, a Fianna FáilFine GaelGreen Party coalition, including some Independents, is seen as the most serious option at this point.However, senior figures in the Greens propose that the position of taoiseach be split between the three parties over a five-year term, with the leaders of the two so-called Civil War parties getting two years each and Mr Ryan getting one. “Mathematically it makes sense,” said a senior Green source. “2-2-1.”Debate is continuing within the parties about the merits of such a coalition after Mr Martin faced calls this week from some within his parliamentary party to open talks with Sinn Féin.A new grassroots group in Fianna Fáil has organised to oppose moves to form a coalition between the party and Fine Gael, and is lobbying TDs to speak up at parliamentary party level.In a further sign of potential difficulties, Mr Martin was robustly criticised by Galway West TD Hildegarde Naughton at the Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting this week. Ms Naughton claimed Mr Martin’s health policies, particularly on providing hospital beds, raised “red flags” and serious concerns."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4195594.1583529591!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord seanad candidates get their campaigns in full swing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Seanad candidate Ruth Coppinger: the former  Solidarity TD took Senator Michael McDowell to task over his praise of ‘billionaire misogynist’ Mike Bloomberg. Photograph: Tom Honan for The Let us not forget that there are more important things going on than the formation of a new government, the search for a saviour for the Labour Party or the arrival of a viral pandemic. Well, one more important thing, to be precise: the Seanad election.This is the weirdest election, with its complicated nomination system of inside and outside panels, nominating bodies, exclusive electorate and bizarre count process. It’s in full swing now, not that many people have noticed. The votes will be counted on March 30th. Counting will take forever.There are 29 candidates in the mix for three seats on the NUI panel, with the outgoing trio hoping to make a return to the Upper House next month. Michael McDowell, Rónán Mullen and Alice Mary Higgins will face a number of candidates who ran unsuccessfully last time out, among them Laura Harmon of the National Women’s Council, who bowed out on the 28th count in 2016.The entry of former TD Ruth Coppinger into the race will be interesting. It is unlikely that Coppinger, who was to the forefront of the Repeal the Eighth campaign, will trouble socially conservative Rónán Mullen’s loyal consitituency. However, it remains to be seen what effect her presence will have on the rest of the voting graduates.On Friday, the former Solidarity TD for Dublin West lined up former tánaiste McDowell in her sights, accusing him of having “an unacceptable blindspot about sexism and sexual harassment” after he made complimentary remarks about billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who dropped out of the US presidential race last week. In a press release, she took the former Progressive Democrats leader to task for calling Bloomberg “an urbane, sophisticated gentleman” in his  column.“This is a billionaire who has subjected female employees to disgusting comments and harassment – calling women ‘fat broads’, ‘horse-faced lesbians’, commenting that they have ‘nice tits’ and that he’d ‘do that piece of meat’. Does Senator McDowell have any problem with these comments which display a bare-faced misogyny?”And so to the election. Having Michael McDowell and Rónán Mullen as two of the three current NUI senators “points up the value of having a socialist feminist voice in the Seanad –an institution which seems to harbour backward ideas and privilege”, said Coppinger. She didn’t mention Alice Mary Higgins, the third Senator in the bunch. Alice Mary is no slouch when it comes to standing up for women’s rights.We thought it only right to ring up leading senior counsel McDowell and ask him about his apparent “unacceptable blindspot”. He was somewhat taken aback by the contents of Coppinger’s press release. “Her remarks and her literature try to conceal the fact that I have spoken and written strongly in support of the Marriage Equality referendum and the Repeal the Eighth referendum. I think I’ll leave the rest of the tirade without comment.”SF’s Fintan Warfield lets his music do the talkingIt’s all go in Sinn Féin these days. We see outgoing Senator Fintan Warfield, who is back in the hunt for a seat on the Cultural and Educational panel, launched an album a couple of weeks ago. Fintan is a talented musician and his most recent appearances have been at Sinn Féin rallies around the country where he led the singing of the National Anthem at the end of proceedings. Fintan, one of the Wolfe Tones Warfields, performs regularly with The Young Wolfe Tones. This is his first solo effort. It’s called Step It Out Mary Lou. No, sorry. It’s called Step It Out Mary and tracks include The Rocky Road to Dublin, Meet Me at the Pillar, The Boys of Fair Hill and The Dying Rebel. It’s available at Connolly Books, Claddagh Records and the Sinn Féin bookshop.Short-serving TD Malcolm Byrne in it for the long haul“I’m kind of a professional canvasser at this stage,” says Fianna Fáil’s Malcolm Byrne, who has fought five election campaigns in the last 10 months, losing two and winning two, and now slap bang in the middle of his fifth.Byrne, a long-standing councillor in Wexford, contested the local and European elections last May. He was re-elected to the council but was pipped at the post for the final seat in Ireland South. In November, he won the byelection caused by Mick Wallace’s departure to Europe and took his seat in the Dáil on December 3rd. The House sat for eight days before the Christmas recess and never reconvened.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar called a general election and Malcolm was on the road again. Two of the candidates he defeated two months earlier won Dáil seats – Independent Verona Murphy and Sinn Féin’s Johnny Mythen, who pulled in just under 25 per cent of the votes.Now Malcolm is running for a seat on the very competitive Cultural and Educational panel, where five Seanad berths are up for grabs. The 20-strong field is top-heavy with former TDs and senators looking to stay in politics at a national level. Given his travails of the past year, it seems appropriate that he has been nominated for the panel by the Drama League of Ireland.This election is also taking a financial toll on the short-serving, if not the shortest-serving TD. Byrne is on a career break from his job as head of communications with the Higher Education Authority. As he didn’t clock up the required six months’ service he didn’t qualify for any severance payment, and is now dipping into his savings as the long Seanad campaign grinds on.Richard Mulcahy follows in his grandparents’ historic footstepsA communication arrives on behalf of a candidate for the Agricultural Panel. “Businessman Richard Mulcahy, grandson of Gen Richard Mulcahy, has secured a nomination from the Royal Dublin Society. He will now tour the country in an effort to secure support from local county councillors, deputies and Senators ahead of Seanad voting at the end of March.”Torchlight processions, we hope. Mulcahy is running as an Independent, focusing on two key pillars: sustainable local agri-business and inclusive communities for the ageing population. Having spent most of his life as a very successful entrepreneur and chief executive of start-up companies in areas including retail pharmacy, electronics, software, catering, construction and forestry, he sold up a number of years ago and is now involved in business at a local community level, working in an advisory capacity with Wexford County Council to help attract new businesses to the county.“Now, like my grandfather, I’d like to influence and shape policy and debate at a national level,” he says in a press release issued by a Stillwater Communications. “Following his family’s philanthropic tradition, Richard has led and donated to the opening of a new park in Wexford in collaboration with Wexford County Council. The 18-acre park, named the Min Ryan public park after his grandmother who was romantically involved with Seán Mac Diarmada at the time of his execution in the aftermath of the 1916 Rising, is due to open this April and will be the first park in Ireland to be named after a woman.”You know what you can do with that Swiss rollThe days of Seanad candidates arriving at councillors’ homes bearing gifts in an attempt to butter them up for a vote are largely a thing of the past. No reports doing the rounds this time of silk ties and scarves, music CDs and bottles of hard liquor being pressed upon potential supporters.However, one councillor in the southern end of the country who is hoping to make the step up to the Upper House tried to get on the good side of a fellow local representative by presenting him with a Swiss roll when he arrived for the canvass and a cup of tea. The recipient of the cake subsequently met a council colleague who was also soft-soaped by the same candidate. Only this time, the sweet inducement was a much larger apple tart. This didn’t go down well.So will you give him your vote, the first councillor was asked.“I will in me Swiss,” came the Cockney-rhyming reply beloved of hard-chaws everywhere.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Brussels condemns Ankara use of migrants for \u0026lsquopolitical purposes\u0026rsquo at Greek-Turkish borderClashes between Syrian army and jihadis puncture uneasy truce after Putin-Erdogan dealTurkish-backed jihadis and insurgents based in Idlib squeezed into a reduced areaErdogan and Putin reach agreement on Syria after six hours of talks in MoscowPresident Erdogan to meet Russian counterpart Putin for talks in MoscowPrime minister\u0026rsquos Likud party needs support of 61 Knesset members to reach majorityExit polls leave his Likud party only one seat short of an overall Knesset majorityBardarash Letter: Camp\u0026rsquos occupants struggle on after having lost everythingOpen border sees Greece struggle with thousands of migrantsGhani says Trump had not asked for release of prisoners as part of peace deal talksTurkish president agrees to reduce tensions in region following consultation with PutinChances look slim that either Netanyahu or Gantz will be able to form governmentSyria warns it will take down any planes, drones breaching air space over northwestWashington will withdraw all troops from country within 14 months if Taliban upholds commitmentsRussia says two sides agreed to reduce tensions in Idlib while continuing military action thereWith the two main groups more or less remaining tied a fourth election cannot be ruled outTurkish call for Idlib no-fly zone not seriously discussed as fears of clash with Russia growMove comes day after 33 Turkish soldiers killed in attack in Syrian province of IdlibWomen still must obtain permission to marry, orce and seek shelter from domestic abuseErdogan says developments turning in Turkey\u0026rsquos favour as fighting heaps miseryStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4195549.1583525752!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu refuses to fork out further cash for turkey migration deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMigrants in the Turkey-Greece border buffer zone in Edirne: The EU will not  increase financial aid to Turkey in response to threats.  Photograph: Bulent Kilic EU governments have refused to increase financial aid to Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Turkey under the terms of their €6 billion migration deal, insisting Europe would not bow to threats from Ankara over opening its border with Greece. Following an emergency meeting in Zagreb on Friday, EU27 foreign ministers held firm on their criticism of Mr Erdogan for using migrants for “political purposes” after a build-up of refugees on the Greek-Turkish border. Mr Erdogan had vowed to open the country’s frontier with Europe at the weekend, sparking the prospect of a new refugee crisis. Germany has been among those pushing for more financial support for Mr Erdogan in an effort to stave off any repeat of Europe’s 2015 migration crisis. Before the events of this week, member states had discussed the possibility of freeing up about €1 billion from the EU’s current budget for the Turkey facility. But ministers on Friday said they would not ramp up aid in response to pressures on the Greek border. Erdogan’s threats“We should not react to the pressure that Turkey is exerting on us by offering them more money under pressure,” said Stef Blok, Dutch foreign minister. Josep Borrell, Brussels’s top diplomat, hit out at Mr Erdogan’s threats, calling them an “unacceptable way to push for further support”.Turkey has demanded more financial help to integrate the nearly four million refugees in the country. The EU has been paying out cash to projects to help the integration process since 2016 but key programmes are due to run out of money soon. Ankara has complained that the cash disbursements are too slow and accused the EU of failing to live up to its promises to liberalise visas for Turks as agreed under the deal.Mr Borrell on Friday said the two sides disagreed on how the deal was working and said Brussels would pay out about €3 billion in remaining funds to earmarked projects by the end of the year.‘Instrumentalisation’ of sufferingEuropean governments have been at loggerheads over how to engage with Turkey after Mr Erdogan’s comment prompted thousands of refugees to head to the border with Greece, sparking violent clashes. Athens has pushed for a tough condemnation of Mr Erdogan’s actions but has met resistance from Berlin and The Hague, which want to keep diplomatic ties open with Ankara. Greece’s foreign minister arrived at the meeting saying there was “clear” proof that Turkey “created and orchestrated” the migration flare-up. “The EU will not allow the instrumentalisation of human suffering,” Nikos Dendias said.EU diplomats monitoring the border developments said the flow of people towards Greece had stopped in recent days and Mr Erdogan was back in compliance with the terms of the 2016 deal. But Mr Borrell did not confirm reports that Turkish authorities were pushing people away from the frontier, calling for an immediate “normalisation” of border controls. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"air conditioning systems could spread coronavirus research shows","story":"Coronavirus could spread around buildings via air conditioning systems or even on a draught, new analysis has suggested after scientists found traces of the virus in a hospital air duct.The results from swab analysis of the rooms used by three coronavirus patients indicate that the disease may be more contagious than previously thought.Even though the patient though to be responsible was suffering only mild symptoms, scientists from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in Singapore found evidence of the virus in the hospital\u0027s air exhaust. This suggests that small, virus-laden droplets may be displaced by airflows and deposited on equipment such as vents, they said.It comes as the Government\u0027s chief scientific advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance, said officials were considering isolating entire households in a bid to control the outbreak after the second Covid-19 death in Britain. Currently, officials are warning the cohabitees of people with symptoms to minimise contact as much as possible, but are not advising that they stay at home as well.Professor Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, criticised the idea of isolating whole families, saying: There is no need to isolate an entire family because an uninfected person poses no risk. If someone else within the family then develops symptoms, they too should immediately isolate.Those in self-isolation should try to minimise interactions with household members during the isolation period and follow the self-isolation advice on the government website.The research from Singapore, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, has implications for the safety of people using buildings that recycle internal air. The same applies to cruise ships, which typically use a mix of recycled air already inside the vessel and fresh air from outside to save on costs. The findings come after more than 700 people came down with coronavirus and at least five died after catching it on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Experts said the policy of quarantining the entire ship in Japan had turned it into a breeding ground for Covid-19.Another cruise liner, the Grand Princess, is waiting off the coast of California while tests are carried out on dozens of passengers.Meanwhile, doctors in Malta have threatened to go on strike if authorities allow in the MSC Opera, carrying 2,302 passengers.Towards the start of the global outbreak, which has now seen 3,412 deaths, virologists suspected that Covid-19 required larger, heavier droplets to survive outside the body. However, the fact that it appears to survive on smaller, lighter droplets – similar to seasonal influenza – makes it more contagious.Professor James G. Dwyer, from Purdue University in Indiana, said: It\u0027s standard practice for the air conditioning systems of cruise ships to mix outside air with inside air to save energy.The problem is that these systems can\u0027t filter out particles smaller than 5,000 nanometers. If the coronavirus is about the same size as Sars, which is 120 nanometers in diameter, then the air conditioning system would be carrying the virus to every cabin. Cruise ships could minimise this problem by just using outside air and not recirculating it.The Singaporian study came as airlines sought to reassure passengers that their aircraft ventilation systems do not recirculate coronavirus. Etihad put out a statement saying that its fleet is equipped with cabin air filtration systems of similar quality to those used in hospital operating theatres.In any confined area, there is a risk of contracting illnesses from other people, the statement said. However, the risk is considered lower on aircraft because of the use of high efficiency particulate air filters, which are effective in capturing more than 99 per cent of airborne microbes in filtered air.As well, cabin air flow is continuous, and delivered at a rate equivalent to up to 30 changes per hour.Because of the hazards faced by the Singapore researchers, they were not able to demonstrate that the viral cultures they identified were viable.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/03/04/TELEMMGLPICT000226772987_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0go9KzD8cVu9iguqnaKUswZA.jpeg?imwidth","title":"bbc blind london bias","story":"How out of touch is the BBC? It’s difficult to know where to startThe Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, didn’t beat around the bush in his first major speech yesterday. He said the BBC must do more to reflect the country and avoid providing a “narrow urban outlook”. There must be genuine ersity of thought, he added. In other words, the BBC is a London-centric, liberal-minded broadcaster that is no longer in touch with the public.Many people would consider that to be stating the obvious. The BBC is in serious trouble. It is losing viewers and listeners in their thousands to online streaming services and to commercial rivals. It is feeling “got at” by the Government. In his role as lightning rod for the Prime Minister, Dominic Cummings has seen fit to ban ministers from going on various BBC programmes, including Radio 4’s flagship Today, because of anti-Tory bias. It is a bias that hasn’t escaped the notice of some viewers and listeners, either.And yet the BBC’s response has not been to reflect, but largely to double-down, repeating its usual mantras about the good value offered by the license fee. If the broadcaster was in a healthy state, it wouldn’t need to be told by a politician to think outside the metropolitan, liberal box.So how out of touch is the BBC? It’s difficult to know where to start. Most obviously, it failed to gauge the public mood on Brexit, constantly obsessing about a second referendum and only paying lip-service to those who gently pointed out that the demand for one didn’t really exist outside Remain-supporting London – coincidentally where most BBC producers and editors live. It even sought to “correct” the views of Brexiteers, with its “Reality Check” journalists, a service that was rarely performed on claims made by Remainers.The election result, therefore, came as an almost total surprise. To be fair, the BBC wasn’t alone in not seeing the Boris majority coming a mile off, but its reaction showed little understanding of what brought it about. Indeed, it was partly the BBC which brought it about. It has consistently struggled to reflect the public’s views on touchstone issues like crime and immigration, which it views as deeply reactionary.Its London-centricity is best illustrated by the Today programme. It regards getting out of London once a month to broadcast from a top tier university as somehow being enough to reflect the mood of the country. Why does it never broadcast from a factory or a call centre?Then consider the BBC’s obsession with going on about what we now are obliged to refer to as the “climate emergency”. Preaching to us all about how terrible we are for the lifestyles we lead does little to endear the broadcaster to its non-Islington audience. Radio 4’s token doff of its cap to its audience is to provide a whole half an hour, yes, 30 minutes, to hearing the views of listeners on Any Answers. Perhaps if it became more like LBC and had a daily phone-in show, it might realise where it’s going wrong.Future of the BBC | The best comment and analysisThe BBC, however, does not seem very interested in local opinion. It is set, for example, on turning its so-called “local” radio stations into carbon copies of each other. In the last few months they’ve all been given identical jingles with the universal strapline of “All the music you love…”.It is also panicking about losing young viewers and listeners, while failing to see that other demographics will not remain loyal forever. To take one example, BBC Radio London is turning its 10pm-1am phone-in into a youth-oriented music show. BBC Radio London has long been a basket case of a station, yet its controller has mysteriously clung onto his job for more than 20 years. Maybe it’s the unique way the BBC is funded. For now, anyway.I want the BBC to succeed. I admire a lot of what it does. But it is threatening to turn in on itself. It’s being held back by an institutionalised management more interested in covering their own backs than promoting innovation and giving viewers and listeners what they want.The battle for eyeballs and ears has never been more cutthroat, and if the BBC fails to acknowledge that it has no ine right to exist in its current form, there will be further trouble ahead.Iain Dale is an LBC presenter.

However, it is only now - more than 1,300 years after her death and after carbon dating her teeth and bones - that historians believe they have finally identified England’s first abbess and one of the country’s earliest saints.The remarkable discovery was made by Kent archaeologists and historians, working with Queen\u0027s University in Belfast, who confirmed that human remains kept at the Church of St Mary and St Eanswythe Folkestone are almost certainly those of the saint.The discovery has been hailed as “a stunning result of national importance and has drawn comparisons with the exhumation of King Richard III after DNA confirmed that bones found beneath a Leicester car park in 2012 were those of the former king of England.The findings revealed at a special event at the church on Friday evening to mark the start of British Science Week 2020.Dr Andrew Richardson, FSA, from the Canterbury Archaeological Trust, said: This locally-based community partnership has produced a stunning result of national importance.It now looks highly probable that we have the only surviving remains of a member of the Kentish royal house, and of one of the earliest Anglo-Saxon saints.Tooth and bone samples were carbon dated and the results pointed to a high probability of a mid-seventh century death date.The relics mark a period that saw the very beginning of Christianity in England - and signify a continuous Christian witness in Folkestone that stretches from her life to the present day.St Eanswythe’s grandfather King Ethelbert was the first English king to convert to Christianity under Augustine. St Eanswythe is believed to have founded one of the earliest monastic communities in England, most likely around AD 660 on the Bayle - the overlooked historic centre of Folkestone. As well as founding the earliest institution for nuns in England, she was also almost certainly its abbess. In 1535, the church was a priory church which had monks. However following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, relics were destroyed across England. It is thought that St Eanswythe\u0027s skull was handed over by the monks. However the rest of her remains might well have been destroyed in the Reformation - along with those of her contemporaries - had they not been concealed in the north wall of the Folkestone church by the monks.St Eanswythe is the patron saint of Folkestone, and is believed to have founded one of the earliest monastic communities in England, most likely around AD 660 on the Bayle - the overlooked historic centre of the town.St Eanswythe is believed to have died between the ages of 17 to 22, however her cause of death is currently unknown. The discovery represents the conjunction of two projects: The Finding Eanswythe Project and Folkestone Museum.The project has been locally led and run, with many of the specialists and team involved originating from Folkestone or East Kent. The team has been supported by a large number of local colleagues and volunteers and  was funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund.The project now needs to raise funds for the next stage of work, which will reveal more about St Eanswythe and to ensure that her remains are housed properly for the future and can be securely displayed for research and tourism purposes.The next analytical steps will include stable isotope analysis and DNA analysis.The Revd Dr Lesley Hardy, director of the Finding Eanswythe project, said: As you walk through the streets of Folkestone, you are walking, layer upon layer, over ancient history that is now largely hidden from view.Finding Eanswythe was about bringing that forgotten history back to the surface.Dr Richardson added: There is more work to be done to realise the full potential of this discovery.But certainly the project represents a wonderful conjunction not only of archaeology and history, but also of a continuous living faith tradition at Folkestone from the mid-seventh century down to the present day.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus uk map where cases","story":"Coronavirus reached Britain in late January, cases have been on the rise since late February and the first death was recorded on March 5.Thousands of people in the UK have been tested for Covid-19, and the government released an emergency action plan to deal with the potential pandemic.It warned up to one in five workers in the UK could be off sick during a coronavirus peak, while the police may switch to only dealing with serious crime. The 27-page document sets out the UK-wide response, with possible measures including the cancellation of non-urgent operations and retired NHS staff being called back to duty.The \u0027s map below plots where cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK. It is sourced from Public Health England announcements and will be updated regularly based on trustworthy data.On Wednesday, Public Health England confirmed 36 new cases of coronavirus had been detected in the UK.And on Friday the Department for Heath and Social Care said an additional 47 patients had been infected - the largest single day rise to date - bringing the total across the UK to 163.Of those located in England, the largest number has been detected in London, with 29 cases recorded in the capital.Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said 29 of the new cases this week had travelled from recognised countries or clusters under investigation.He said three contracted the virus in the UK, but it was not yet clear if they contracted it directly or indirectly from someone returning from abroad. An elderly patient with underlying health conditions was the first person to die in the UK having been diagnosed with coronavirus, according to the Royal Berkshire NHS Trust.A second death was confirmed on Friday.The unnamed patient in his 80s is thought to have succumbed to COVID-19 on Thursday night while being treated at Milton Keynes, Hospital, Bucks.Prof Whitty said all UK cases were being investigated and contact tracing has begun.He told BBC Breakfast there could be a need to do extreme things to protect the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions in the event of a UK epidemic.He said the NHS would cope with a major spread of cases but could come under very high pressure in a large epidemic.He said: For the great majority of people this will be a mild or moderate disease, anything from a sniffle to having to go to bed for a few days rather like with mild flu.And there are some people who will get it with no symptoms at all, but for a minority of people - and this is particular in people who are older people or people with pre-existing health conditions - the risk is higher.The NHS will always cope because the NHS is an emergency service which is very good at adapting to what it finds itself with.But he said if the UK sees a very large epidemic, then it will put very high pressure on the NHS and there could be several weeks which could be very difficult for the health service and wider society.Prof Whitty said he believes there is now onward transmission between people in the UK - which could lead to spiralling numbers - although only two cases of this nature have been identified so far. Mitigation efforts in the UK will be driven by the UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy 2011 and fall into four main areas:At the end of December, the Chinese authorities sent out a public alert warning that a pneumonia of unknown cause had been identified in Wuhan, central China.Some 10 days later, on Jan 7, scientists announced that a new coronavirus was the source of the outbreak – quickly adding that it did not appear to be spreading between humans. At that point, fewer than 60 cases had been found. But now the virus, which has since been named Covid-19, has spread to well over 70 countries, infecting more than 93,000 people and killing nearly 3,200. Scientists believe that the virus has mutated into two strains: the older ‘S-type’ appears to be milder and less infectious, while the ‘L-type’ which emerged later, spreads quickly and currently accounts for around 70 per cent of cases. This map, which updates automatically, shows where the disease is now, how many cases there have been and how many people have died: More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/05/TELEMMGLPICT000227008933_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"covid 19 isnt just flu itis time take virus seriously","story":"Italy is shutting its schools and restaurants are desertedPublic libraries are putting away children’s toys. Supermarkets are running low on loo paper. Everywhere, you see the furtive rubbing of hands that indicates the breaking out of sanitising gel (while stocks last). In a somewhat unexpected development, sales of Corona beer have fallen through the floor.Yet still, for the most part, we remain nonchalant. Two American friends visiting recently were astonished to find Londoners going about their business largely as normal. There is even a faint air of contempt here for the drastic measures being taken in some parts of the world. China is welding people into apartment buildings, Italy is shutting its schools and Switzerland is cancelling luxury watch conferences, but we Brits know how to take on a little dose of the flu without so much hoo-ha! This air of confidence is misplaced.There is still a huge amount we don’t know about this new virus. Even the death rate is just an estimate. Taking only confirmed cases – recoveries versus deaths – results in a death rate close to 6 per cent. But scientists are pretty sure that there must be hundreds of thousands of “invisible” cases with symptoms so mild that the carrier hasn’t been tested. That is how they get to their best guess death rate of 1 per cent.The chances are that the real rate could be lower still. The NHS is better prepared than China’s health system was when this started, not least because it is better funded and we have had time to get ready. But the risk for the elderly is still uncomfortably high. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, did not manage to sound entirely reassuring when asked to calm fears amongst old people and he replied: “The great majority of people will survive this.” By which he means around 85 per cent, from the data so far.There is also a question-mark around smokers. One theory is that the higher death rate for men and the deaths among young, seemingly fit health workers in China is due to smoking, but there is no data either way. Brits, fortunately, smoke less than the Chinese.Unfortunately, efforts at containment are hitting an intractable problem. Of the 163 cases identified at the time of writing (of about 20,000 tested) in the UK, at least a dozen simply cannot be traced back to any other known case or foreign travel. In other words, the illness is already spreading undetected. One possibility is that children, who mercifully seem to be less vulnerable to the disease, are nonetheless getting it and displaying no symptoms, thereby acting as silent spreaders. This is one reason why schools for nearly 300 million children worldwide are now closed.These other countries who are shutting schools and cancelling conferences are doing so not because they are a bunch of overreacting wimps, but because it may be one of the most effective ways to slow the spread of the disease. Over here, UK policymakers are watching attentively to see whether it works and if we ought to do likewise. Whether this hesitation is sensible and proportionate or a historic mistake is not yet clear.The unspoken truth is that these decisions are ultimately about risk appetite. Scientists can offer advice, but the uncertainties are so great that politicians ultimately have to take decisions about how far to go. The government appears, so far, to be taking the risk that it is not worth implementing measures that cause enormous disruption China, because widespread contagion is ultimately inevitable.There are good reasons for this approach. We know that the epidemic has slowed down in China, but we have no idea if this is due to its drastic quarantine measures, which have plunged its economy into deep freeze. It seems more likely that China’s supreme effort at contact-tracing, which involves finding and testing everyone who has had intimate contact with virus sufferers, was the key factor in dampening down the virus’ spread. The UK has traced the contacts of confirmed patients as much as it can so far.Disruption also has other costs. There have been Chinese cases reported of people in need of urgent medical care for other illnesses but finding themselves trapped in their houses because of the shutdown. And you cannot keep an economy in lockdown forever. When workers return to factories and children go back to school, contagion may well flare up again. Even if we were to shut down schools now, who is to say the virus would not just come back when they reopened?The UK’s approach carries its own risks, however. It may turn out that a short, sharp period of disruption now would stop the virus in its tracks and that we are missing a vital chance. It is hard to imagine that this would not be the undisputed policy choice if those at most risk were young children, rather than the elderly.The virus planning paper released this week estimated that, in a worst-case scenario, 80 per cent of people could ultimately get infected. Such an enormous epidemic is unlikely, but if the virus grows on anything like that scale, the disruption to daily life and the health system will make a few conference cancellations look like a mere prelude. In Hubei province, for example, where the virus first emerged, there are just over 67,000 confirmed cases. That is equivalent to just 0.1 per cent of the population. Even accounting for the many “invisible” cases that have not been identified, the gap between 0.1 and 80 per cent suggests that scientists think there is a long, long way to go before this thing dies down.Boris Johnson is keen to put the country at ease. This week, he claimed to have visited a hospital of coronavirus patients and, “I shook hands with everybody!” But we should be under no illusions.

They could be told to self-isolate if they’ve got symptoms, to call NHS 111, or simply be reminded to wash their hands.The plan is understood to have been devised by Public Health England, which then approached the telecoms firms through the DCMS. Companies will be asked about the cost and feasibility of adopting the system before the outbreak reaches its expected peak in the coming weeks. There are already more than 160 cases in the UK (see map below).Last night, Lord Harris of Haringey, who sits on the National Security Strategy Committee, urged the government to deliver the alerting system as soon as possible.This would appear to be a good idea, he said.Any way to get information out there quickly and easily must be welcomed. My only worry is that these messages will have to be quite long, so I do wonder whether people would actually read them.We can\u0027t be bombarding people, otherwise they\u0027ll just switch off.Under EU law, every citizen using their mobile phone when travelling to another member state must automatically receive a text message with emergency information on arrival.In the UK, the welcome messages are sent only to mobile phones registered in foreign countries. The coronavirus plan would see SMS texts sent to every phone, including returning British citizens.Officials from the Cabinet Office have also contacted telecoms firms to discuss a more ambitious cell broadcasting system, it is understood.Unlike the welcome message technology, the system would allow alerts to be sent to specific geographic areas deemed to be at risk. The technology is already used in other countries including the US to warn against nuclear attack or natural disaster.Supporters claim the message alerts could have saved lives during major incidents including the London Bridge terrorist attack and Grenfell Tower fire.Senior figures have raised concerns, however, that the messages could be hijacked by hackers or malicious foreign powers to induce mass panic.The project is being overseen by Dr Nigel P. Brown from the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, the government body responsible for emergency planning, and officials from Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Fujitsu, the Japanese telecommunications giant, was commissioned last year to examine how the system could be developed in the UK.The idea of a public alert system was also heavily backed by police and fire chiefs in the wake of the London Bridge terror attack, The  disclosed.During a secret summit on Dec 5, a week after the attack, senior fire and police officers asked why it was taking so long for the technology to be introduced in Britain.Held at the BT Tower in central London, the summit was attended by officials from the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, the government body responsible for emergency planning, and senior leaders from the NHS, National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council, politan Police and National Fire Chiefs Council. Multiple sources told The  of their frustration at the Government\u0027s slow progress in adopting a public alert system. One senior officer is said to have asked why emergency workers are expected to tackle major disasters with older technology than the public we are trying to help. A mass warning system using SMS technology was trialled in 2013 but returned “disappointing” results, according to government documents.The new cell broadcasting system would automatically send alerts to every smartphone regardless of whether the user had opted in. Major mobile phone operators have helped develop the technology for use in the UK while the Australian government, which uses the system during wildfires, has also been asked for advice.The approach is already used widely in other countries including the United States and India. In January 2018, an incoming missile alert plunged residents of Hawaii into panic before it was declared a false alarm. Later it emerged that a junior worker had accidentally pressed the wrong button.A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture Media and Sport refused to comment last night.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"stocking loo roll may not bum idea","story":"Of all the household products that most people would fear running short of it is surely lavatory paper that tops the listAside from prescription medicines, of all the household products that most people would fear running short of it is surely lavatory paper that tops the list. And the panic-buying of is not as irrational as it might appear.In short, we don’t make much of it. This country is one of Europe’s biggest importers of lavatory paper and disposable nappies (which use pulp paper). Around 85 per cent – or 1.1 million out of 1.3 million tonnes – of all the toilet tissue used in the UK annually is imported, according to The Confederation of Paper Industries.The real question, as the urge to prep for the coming coronavirus outbreak takes hold, is how likely is the UK to run out? Australia, which is highly reliant on Chinese supply chains that have been crunched by draconian factory closures, has already seen panic-buying to the point where the government has introduced controls. Shopkeepers have had to call the police in to break up fights over the last few rolls available, such are the indignities of rushing to preserve one’s dignity in a crisis.For now, no-one expects European countries to face that kind of crunch since the levels of factory closures possible in Xi Jinping’s China are much less acceptable over here. The odds are still that the paper mills of Scandinavia will keep on turning, and the UK will still be adequately catered for – so long as nobody panics.Which is, of course, the problem. Back during last year’s no-deal Brexit preparations, Government advisers told me quietly that “the one thing I’d stockpile, if I was you” was loo paper, given the UK’s vulnerability to supply chain disruption. This, of course, I rapidly shared with  readers.Loo paper is bulky, so if everyone buys two or three extra packets, very quickly you start to see wide empty spaces opening up on supermarket shelves, which only redoubles the panic. If there’s no loo paper, even the most sanguine shopper will ask, then what next? Simultaneously, this shakes confidence in government assurances that there is enough of everything to go round – meaning that promises of plenty made in good faith in the morning media round can be rendered worthless by the afternoon.Which brings us back to Brexit. As things stand, the Government under Boris Johnson is charging much harder towards the Brexit finish line than that of his predecessor Theresa May, overtly threatening a no-deal Australian-style if the EU does not come to heel. The transport industry is very clear that this risks bringing back the spectre of long delays at the ports, clogging up the Channel Tunnel as hauliers battle with mountains of new paperwork and customs and safety declarations.If that happens, there remains a serious risk that the Australian-style Brexit might include some Australian-style loo-paper shortages.

How do I self-isolate? Is it the same as social distancing? Why are things different in France and Italy? And what about my gran?Confusion is growing over the Government’s “contain, delay, research and mitigate strategy”. For some, it is provoking anxiety and in others complacency is setting in. The problem is fueled by its title. It mixes goals with actions and encourages the idea that its components must follow one another in strict sequence: contain - delay - research - mitigate. The Number 10 press team may have thought the sound-bitey title would appeal to a British sense of orderliness, but it’s a poor shorthand for the real deal. Even Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer and a man who knows an objective from an action, is struggling: We are now basically, mainly in delay, but we are maintaining some elements of contain, we are mainly in the second stage at this point”, he told MPs on Friday. The actual strategy we are following comes from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the EU’s main public health body. Its timeline is defined, not by objectives, but the likely progress of an outbreak in five scenarios (zero to four) as it moves across Europe. At one end of the continuum is “scenario 0”, a country like Bulgaria with no recorded cases. At the other end is “scenario 4”, a country like Italy with widespread infection.At each stage in the timeline, the principle objective a government should be pursuing is given - containment, delay and mitigation, etc. Below that are all the practical measures and actions it should be taking to achieve the objective - contact tracing, hand washing messages, school closures etc.  Laying out the strategy like this has benefits. It drives home that a disease outbreak is not a static thing but one which develops over time. Questions about differing national responses start to fade, because it becomes apparent they are at different points on the same epidemic curve but following common guidelines.Crucially for the designated “public face” of the response - Prof Whitty in England - it becomes obvious that things like containment, delay and research will be happening simultaneously much of the time. The UK sits at or about scenario 2 on the ECDC document, with cases that have been imported and some local human-to human transmission. The main goal for the moment is contain and delay and all the counter measures recommended for this phase have been implemented.Next stop will be scenario 3, roughly where France, Spain and Germany sit now. This is when localised outbreaks start to merge and sustained human-to-human transmission takes grip, putting pressure on the health service. A range of “mitigation” measures including the possible cancellation of mass gatherings, such as sports events and concerts, will then be considered. France has placed a ban on gatherings of over 5,000 people, for example.It is still not certain that we will move to the next phase, although it is probable. The UK response has so far been strong and it may yet prove possible to contain the virus. Prof Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, said: I think we\u0027re doing relatively well, I think those that have been diagnosed positive seem to have been diagnosed quickly, which minimises their chances of spreading it and also maximises treatment possibility.  Prof Jones said there was also a degree of luck involved: It depends on the density of the population and frequency of travel within that population. If someone is in the middle of Cornwall in a farmhouse not going anywhere, they won\u0027t catch it or spread it. That\u0027s obviously a very different scenario compared to someone in central Manchester”. Others said the key to understanding the Government’s strategy was to regard it as “flexible”. In different phases, the Government\u0027s actions may remain the same but be re-emphasised. If a pocket of the country remained virus free it would be perfectly sensible to put in place containment measures there, even if the disease was widespread elsewhere and mitigation measures were dominant. The need for research will be a constant throughout.I think it\u0027s a strategy based on the evidence here in the UK and in my view it\u0027s one that should be as modified as risk assessments tell, said David Heymann, an epidemiologist and former assistant director general of the WHO. It\u0027s flexible and if there is new evidence it can rapidly change. Interventions can be singular or blended.There is also some confusion about what has become known as self isolation or voluntary quarantine, with many unsure what it entails and others interpreting it overly literally.  Do you lock yourself in the loo and avoid all people, or do you remain in the house but don’t go out? To what extent are you isolated alone or with other people? This is something that has to be judged on a case by case basis, said Prof Jones, who suggested a common sense approach - don’t self isolate with elderly relatives, for instance. If the outbreak progresses to scenario three or four in the UK on the ECDC scale, the major pinch point will be a squeeze on NHS services. Although the UK ranks number two in the world for pandemic preparedness, our underfunded health system is a weak point. Other issues include high levels of urbanisation, age profile of the population and the fact that some elements of our preparedness are not made available for external review.Jonathan Ball, professor of virology at the University of Nottingham, said that self isolation as a means to take pressure off the NHS was a necessary risk: There\u0027s just not the capacity in hospitals and there\u0027s no medical or clinical reason to keep someone with something that is essentially a cold in hospital.The only benefit of the hospital policy previously was containment - that\u0027s the risk, you\u0027re reliant on goodwill. In terms of care and health of the patient there\u0027s no problem, but the patients really do need to adhere to not wandering around the community if we\u0027re going to continue to slow this virus down.  Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/05/19/container.jpg","title":"coronavirus business impact britain no deal brexit","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.While large multinationals may be able to ride out the economic turmoil on the horizon, some smaller firms have more to worry about.\u0026nbspBen Chapman reportsBritish manufacturers say they are summoning up the “wartime spirit” to deal with anticipated staff shortages and supply disruption caused by the coronavirus.But for some, the major concern is a short, deep shock from the outbreak followed by the longer, more drawn-out pain of a hard Brexit.While large multinationals may be able to ride out those twin problems, some smaller firms have more to worry about.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe government warned this week that up to a fifth of the workforce could be off sick at the height of the Covid-19 epidemic, a scenario that would present serious problems for manufacturers.“We may have a few people off or we may be decimated,” says Donald Pow, a manager at Allied Vehicles Group in Glasgow.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson spokesman insists coronavirus will not delay BrexitAround 250 of Allied’s 670 staff work in manufacturing, mostly in Glasgow. They operate 15 stages of a production line which transforms ordinary vehicles to make them accessible for people with disabilitiesWorkers at each stage have specialised expertise which can’t necessarily be replaced if significant numbers are off work. Clearly working from home is not an option.“It’s very difficult. We can move people from other parts of the business but at some point we would not be running efficiently,” says Pow. “We’re not just going to shut our doors and say, ‘Things are a bit difficult, let’s stop working.’\u0026nbspThere’s a bit of that wartime spirit.”For Allied, Brexit, and the\u0026nbspuncertainty over what it will entail, represent bigger concerns than the virus, says Pow –\u0026nbspat least for now.The company exports vehicles to countries across western Europe. It is already concerned about tariffs and the effect of a highly uncertain future. “Brexit is affecting both the reality of our business and our customers’ confidence,” says Pow, who is concerned the company will be less competitive in future with rivals based inside the EU.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The same cannot be said for many British companies who may need to call on emergency funding to ride any turbulence caused by the outbreak.The Bank of England’s governor, Andrew Bailey\u0026nbsp(who starts the job in 10\u0026nbspdays), told MPs this week he may take action imminently to support lending to struggling small businesses. That might include relaxing banks’ capital requirements to allow them to hand out more loans – but there’s no guarantee that the banks will actually do it.Live: EU reveals ‘very difficult differences’ with UK over BrexitBoris Johnson spokesman insists coronavirus will not delay BrexitCoronavirus and no-deal Brexit: Spot the differenceBoost from US trade deal could be as small as 0.02 per cent of GDPFor some British firms, the impact is already being felt.Tudor Rose International, a Gloucestershire-based logistics company, exports well-known food and drinks brands around the world.\u0026nbspIt is close to the sharp end of the outbreak. Costs have shot up around 15 per cent so far as the company struggles to find enough ships to transport its products, says commercial manager\u0026nbspJohn Stephenson.\u0026nbspTudor Rose is losing sales as ships stay stuck in Chinese ports, causing a major backlog in the key arteries of world trade.\u0026nbspWith many Chinese factories shut down to contain the virus’s spread, there is much less to ship and so freight companies have cancelled sailings. That leaves British firms facing a shortage of containers to put their goods into, pushing up prices.“It has an effect all along those routes via places like Mumbai and the Middle East,” says\u0026nbspStephenson.Shipping is often seen as a canary in the coal mine for economic shocks to come. With a vessel taking about a month to make its way from China to Europe, the sharp drop in activity in China is still working its way through.Stephenson estimates that there are about 100 fewer vessels on the global routes along which Tudor Rose ships its food and drink. That may not sound like a lot but each one is vast, carrying an average 20,000 containers.Two million fewer containers has a real impact, says Stephenson. “It’s already been quite pronounced. We’ve had a customer already waiting for a large order that we haven’t been able to fill.”Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, ChinaThe effect coronavirus is having on shipping is unprecedented, he says. “We do see some seasonality of demand but we’ve not seen an event like this that’s had this much impact.”Tudor Rose has been looking to boost sales in North America where disruption has been less severe than Asia but there is a limit to this strategy.“We sell fast-moving consumer goods so we need a consistent, regular supply to our customers,” says Stephenson. The company anticipates some rebound in demand when the outbreak calms down but for the most part, sales lost now are likely to be lost for good.If Chinese ports open up fully again things will improve, but Tudor Rose fears there may be further shutdowns at other key points along the route as governments seek to contain the virus.“We are at the early stages of this. It’s only in the last 10\u0026nbspdays that it’s come to light how significant this could be,”\u0026nbspsays StephensonBack in Glasgow, Donald Pow is remaining vigilant but relatively relaxed, given the situation. “We don’t know what’s going to happen many of the experts don’t seem to know what’s going to happen.”“It’s like that old football manager cliche: we just take each game as it comes.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Or are companies in for disappointment?Hundreds of flights have been cancelled, major sporting events called off.Business has dried up entirely for some unfortunate firms.The economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak has already been significant.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd it’s likely to get worse.There’s speculation the Tokyo Olympics this summer might need to be postponed – a festival on which the Japanese government has already spent some $25bn (£19bn).But that’s why businesses and iniduals take out insurance isn’t it? To cover themselves for when unexpected and hugely damaging shocks like disease outbreaks hit?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?Latest travel updates as coronavirus continues to spreadCan face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe UK government this week, under pressure from industry lobby groups, designated\u0026nbspCovid-19 a “notifiable disease”, in order to make it easier for affected companies to claim insurance.So can we expect an avalanche of claims and big losses for insurance companies as a result of this outbreak?Or are companies in for disappointment if they expect to be compensated for the economic damage wreaked by Covid-19?It’s worth drawing a distinction between two broad categories of business insurance, say experts.First, there’s event cancellation insurance, which is a type generally offered by sophisticated insurance markets like Lloyd’s of London or major insurance conglomerates.Torsten Jeworrek of the German insurer Munich Re\u0026nbsptold\u0026nbspReuters\u0026nbsplast month that his firm had provided cancellation insurance for the Tokyo games “in the hundreds of millions of euros”.Second, there’s the more general cover for “business interruption” offered to companies by smaller insurance firms.But if a firm is covered it’s covered, isn’t it?Not necessarily. It all depends on the wording of the inidual insurance contract.But it’s important to bear a broad principle in mind, namely that there’s a difference from the perspective of the insurance company between “definable” and “undefinable” risk.And insurance firms are unlikely to have written an insurance policy that covers a firm from the impact of an undefinable risk.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Think of a hotel that sees its bookings slump because people change their travel plans. Or a company that suffers because it’s staff don’t turn up to work because of illness.Would cutting rates really help the economy deal with coronavirus?In any case, industry experts caution that “notifiable disease” clauses (the classification the UK government updated this week) are not standard in insurance contracts.“Standard business insurance policies are designed and priced to cover standard risks, not those that are very unlikely, such as the effects of Covid-19,” said a spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers.So what’s the bottom line: are insurers going to be hit hard or not?Crawford Forensic Accounting Services produced a report last month on the likely impact of coronavirus on the insurance sector.It concluded that “successful claims under business interruption coverage for infection are not common”.Crawford director Frederique Hardy also told The Independent that event cancellation insurance contracts tend to be very bespoke, making it difficult to generalise about the ability of event organisers to make claim.Yet the general view of the industry – at the moment – is that coronavirus is unlikely to result in an explosion of costly payouts.If that’s correct it points to a lot of disappointed firms.And, as a by product, it’s likely to increase further the pressure on governments to give stressed companies economic relief in the form of more time to pay tax and perhaps forbearance on debt repayments to banks.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Bank of Canada and the Reserve Bank of Australia also cut rates, with investors expecting other major central banks to soon follow suit.Officials and companies in Britain, France, Italy and the United States are struggling to deal with a steady rise in virus infections that have in some cases triggered corporate defaults, office evacuations, and panic buying of daily necessities.The outbreak spread across the United States on Thursday, surfacing in at least four new states.“The interplay of virus containment fears and stimulus measures means that in the near term we expect market volatility to persist,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.Yields on US Treasuries fell to a record low and Treasury futures jumped as investors increased bets that the Fed will follow this week’s surprise rate cut with further easing.The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to a record low of 0.7650 per cent on Friday.Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari said late on Thursday the Fed could cut rates further if needed.Money markets are pricing in another 25 basis-point-cut from the current 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent range at the next Fed meeting on March 18-19 and a 50-basis-point cut by April.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In life, her dentition appears to have been pristine – with virtually no pre-death wear and tear.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But as coastal erosion undercut the cliffs, the abbesses who succeeded her\u0026nbspincreasingly realised that the building would eventually end up crashing into the sea below.Some time in the eighth century\u0026nbspher remains were removed from the stricken chapel and put into a specially built shrine in the nunnery’s main church.\u0026nbspBy the late 11 century, the nunnery had become a monastery.However, following the Norman conquest, a\u0026nbspcastle was built around it – so, in the 12\u0026nbspcentury, the monks demanded that they be allowed to move to a new, less secular, site.The princess’s bones were therefore disinterred again\u0026nbspand moved, in 1138, a few hundred metres away to a brand new church, a later version of which still stands today as Folkestone’s Parish Church. There she became the centre of a local cult and was believed to be able to help cure disease. Her official saint’s day\u0026nbspis 12 September.But, after the mediaeval period had drawn to a close, Eanswythe’s story took a new and unexpected turn.When Henry VIII broke away from the Roman Catholic Church and established the Church of England, the government became increasingly hostile to the veneration of saints. In 1535, the prior of Folkestone seems to have realised that, unless he took drastic action, government officials would seize and destroy Eanswythe’s bones. So he (or some of his monks) appear to have hurriedly forced the lead box containing them\u0026nbspinto a secret hole in the church wall and blocked it off.The prior, or a senior church member, then showed the officials a probably gold or gem-studded reliquary, almost certainly containing just a few parts of the saint’s skull.Discoveries offer detailed glimpse of life in prehistoric BritainThat box, with its diminished contents, was subsequently seized by the government and was then acquired by a member of Henry VIII’s household, a Folkestone politician and businessman called Anthony Aucher, who no doubt profited substantially by selling any gems which had adorned the reliquary.Meanwhile, Eanswythe rested safe and secure in her dark hiding place inside the church’s north wall, just beside the altar.Gradually her hiding place was forgotten – until, in 1885, workmen engaged in modernising the church\u0026nbspstumbled across her remains. There was immediate speculation about the possibility that they could be the bones of St Eanswythe and the discovery was reported in newspapers worldwide.But in the 19th century, there was no way of confirming her identity.So for 132 years, the bones were stashed away in a specially constructed wall niche and once again began to fade from memory, until just three years ago a group of local historians and archaeologists decided to try to solve the mystery.They did so by asking scientists to examine the bones in order to discover the long-dead inidual’s age at death and sex – and by carrying out radiocarbon dating tests to ascertain whether the bones did indeed date from the seventh century.The answers virtually proved that the fragmentary skeleton was indeed that of St Eanswythe.The scientists were able to demonstrate that the inidual was almost certainly female.Medieval sources had said that she had died very young – and the scientific examination of her bones and teeth revealed that the inidual had been between 17 and 21 years old when she had passed away.The radiocarbon tests then revealed that she had died in the mid-seventh century – the exact period when Eanswythe‘s life ended.What’s more, examination of her teeth showed virtually no pre-death scratches on her tooth enamel, a fact that suggests that she had consumed relatively little coarse food.Throughout the medieval period, a large number of stories attached themselves to her. She was credited with at least five miracles\u0026nbspand was venerated by people in the Folkestone area.She was believed, for instance, to have miraculously made water run uphill (a story probably developed in order to explain an optical illusion which seemed to show a local aqueduct channelling water up a gradient). She was also credited for resurrecting a dead goose that had been stolen and eaten.Eanswythe was also said to have miraculously lengthened a wooden beam to construct a church by calling on Christ to help when a pagan king and his gods had failed to lengthen it.And after her death, her ghost was said to have cured a man suffering from leprosy or some other skin disease.Remains of ‘man who named Australia’ found during HS2 excavationWho was Suzy Lamplugh? New excavations aim to solve 1986 murderExcavations of medieval chapel at site linked to King ArthurBut, beyond those legends, what was her real significance?In a sense, she symbolises the huge contribution to early English history made by high-status women.\u0026nbspPrior to the coming of Christianity, it is not known whether Anglo-Saxon women played any major political roles.But the coming of Christianity certainly provided one. Princesses played a major part in the conversion of England from paganism to the new faith. When Anglo-Saxon and other Christian princesses married pagan Anglo-Saxon kings, their presence often allowed Christianity to gain the upper hand and flourish.What’s more, those royal daughters who did not marry kings and princes were established by their royal fathers or brothers as abbesses of a new type of institution – nunneries, which in turn, alongside the monasteries, began to wield substantial social and cultural influence. Many of the new abbesses (like Eanswythe) became popular saints and were revered for centuries.St Eanswythe died some 1,360 years ago\u0026nbspbut her newly rediscovered life and times are about to captivate a new audience.“Our identification of St Eanswythe’s skeletal remains open up the possibility of using DNA to investigate the ancestry of the Kentish and Frankish royal dynasties,” said the senior archaeologist involved in the project, Dr Andrew Richardson of the Canterbury Archaeological Trust.“St Eanswythe was a local heroine of great relevance to local people. In mediaeval times, they saw her as their protector from disease and suffering. Researching her today will bring the people of Folkestone nearer to that history,” said the head of the Finding Eanswythe project, Dr Lesley Hardy, a historian at Canterbury Christ Church University.The project is being largely financed by the National Lottery Heritage Fund.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some members of staff working on the scheme may have left their posts for more secure positions.”Ms Lant called on the Home Office to avoid a “cliff-edge” scenario where people suddenly become undocumented for missing the deadline, and demanded clarity around the circumstances under which applications would still be accepted following the cut-off date.\u0026nbspCaitlin Boswell Jones, project officer at the Join Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said the £8m investment was welcome but that it “barely touched” what was needed to support all vulnerable people – and called on ministers to grant automatic settled status to all EU citizens.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The likelihood is that tens of thousands of EU citizens will be unable to apply, will then fall out of status and become vulnerable to the hostile environment.”Marianne Lagrue, policy manager at Coram’s migrant children’s project, said the charity welcomed the Home Office’s announcement, but warned that a finite pot of money\u0026nbspthe lasts for one year was “not going to cut it” for a scheme for which applications are going to get increasingly complex.“The concentration of complex case within the number of cases that remain is getting bigger and bigger as we get closer to the deadline. We expect that there will be a flurry towards the deadline, and there will be people who miss it. Whether or not there will continue to be public money available to assist these people remains an unanswered question,” she said.“The funding needs to be guaranteed in perpetuity and to adequately meet the need and complexity of the cases.”Charity helping children in care stay in UK has to stop taking casesMs Lagrue said that vulnerable applicants would increasingly require legal professionals, rather than NGOs, to help them apply – and called on the government to consider introducing legal aid for these cases.“Rather than creating something new specifically to meet the needs of this cohort, the Home Office needs to fund the basic tenets of the welfare state that are there to capture these people with their legal problems,” she said.“The government needs to take a holistic view of the long-term needs of people. Anyone with a complex case and anyone who has an appeal should be eligible for legal aid.”It comes after it emerged\u0026nbspthe EU settlement scheme was responsible for breaching\u0026nbspGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law 100 times between April and August last year.A report by the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration (ICIBI) also raised concerns about a lack of support for vulnerable applicants, hidden costs of applying and a lack of transparency and detail in the Home Office data.In total, 3.2 million people have so far registered for EU settled status, which they must obtain in order to continue living legally in the UK after June 2021. Of these, 2.7 million have been granted the status – meaning around 500,000 applications are currently going through the system.Announcing the new funding on Friday, Mr Foster said: “EU citizens are an integral part of our society, culture and community, and this is their home. Supporting vulnerable EU citizens and their families is at the forefront of our approach to the EU Settlement Scheme.The Home Office has been contacted for comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Within an hour, I was heading up Interstate 5 to Everett, to talk to health officials and get reactions from residents. (Summation of interviews: Not concerned. Trying to stay calm.)Six weeks later, the nation’s first fatality was reported in the suburb of Kirkland. This time it was a dash northwest on Interstate 405 to talk to people stocking in a supermarket close to the hospital where the person had died and where the LifeCare Centre nursing home was located. (Summation of interviews: Increasingly concerned. Trying to calm, but anxious.)Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow the death toll has reached 11. More than 100,000 employees of companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Facebook, among them my wife, have been told to work from home to reduce the spread of the virus. \u0026nbspResidents over the age of 60, or people with underlying health conditions, have also been advised to stay at home. Officials have ordered school districts to close. They have also suggested community groups cancel events involving more than ten people.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, ChinaImages from stores such a Costco show massive lines.

Mike Pence is visiting the state capital.And yet people in the neighhourhood coffee shop this morning appeared to display little concern. One customer, Lindsay Berger, who was chatting to two other women, said she was stunned by how people were “overreacting”.“It makes me worry what we’d do if there was a real crisis,” she said. She said friends in New York had sent her images of the Union Square branch of Whole Foods Market with the shelves bare.\u0026nbsp“This is contagious, but mild.

It feels an exercise in indulgence and privilege to report people’s concerns about whether to take a flight on their vacation. It hardly feels like a crisis if people can click a button to restock their food cupboard.\u0026nbspAs with so much of today’s world, privilege will likely emerge as a defining faultline as the coronavirus crisis plays out.If you have health insurance you know you can be treated if you fall ill. If you have a place to live, you can work from home, assuming you have a job. Unless, that is, you work in one of the warehouses filled with canned food, or are a delivery driver, or work in a coffee shop or fast-food restaurant.But what about the estimated 5,0000 of Seattle’s homeless, their plight worsened by the shortage in affordable housing those thousands of well-rewarded tech employees\u0026nbsphave helped to create?How do you get treatment for coronavirus if your home is a tent under the interstate, or next to a new construction?

Is it that person sneezing on the bus? What about that person walking their dogs?For reporters, the challenge is identifying the locus. What is the essence of the story we’re trying to cover?As health officials step up their testing, many cases will be reported. We are almost certainly likely to see more deaths. At some point, those numbers will start to reduce, but that may be some time away.A heartening comment came from a member of staff in that coffee shop this morning when I expressed some surprise to find it open. She said it had been “business as usual” but that “everybody is making an effort to be super friendly”.Was that the employees or the customers, I asked.

Hook, line, and sinker, I guess. He did it.”Mr Adigrati said the thief probably did not know the value of the necklace.“This particular necklace looks a lot more expensive than what it is, so obviously the temptation was there: gold, bright, iconic Medusa head, so that would have been the temptation,” he told ABC News.Police are appealing for more information on the man, who has yet to be identified. He is described as white, aged between 40 to 50 years old and about 5ft 9in.The thief left just one clue behind – the hook from his fishing line.Senior constable Bede Whitty said he had never seen a crime quite like it before.“It’s fairly blatant and it’s quite bold as well, to have someone attend with a fishing rod in the middle of the night,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In extreme poverty, there is just not the ability to wash and sanitise hands regularly, for example.But this is the UK – one of the richest countries in the western world. We have the ability to collectively try and shut this disease down from spreading here.I’ve been fascinated and horried in equal measure over the past week on my talkRADIO show as listeners have shared true gross out stories of folk not washing their hands after going to the public loos or coughing all over communal food in the workplace or sneezing without a tissue on public transport.We can do better. And now we must – our very way of le could be dependent on it.In Japan where the tradition of wearing masks began, it was because people who had colds wanted to try and protect others from their germs.And perhaps Kim Woodburn – the undisputed queen of clean – had a point last week when she told me we are acting like “dirty devils” in this country and in this case it could actually kill us.The time has come for a dialogue about how we can call out people publicly but politelythey fail to reach basic standards of cleanliness.Looking after ourselves and being kind to each other is not simply limited to the words we use in the public domain.If you are running a business how about encouraging staff who are sick and clearly putting others at risk of infection to have the opportunity to work for a couple of days from home without feeling they are letting the side down in some way.If you are not in a good way healthwise yourself then take a couple of days off, avoid public transport and enclosed spaces with others, and realise that the world won’t come to an end while you’re recovering.If you are a parent or teacher start enforcing standards on our kids when it comes to going to the toilet and washing hands and eating.Andyou run a restaurant make sure hand sanitisers and soap are always available for customers and staff.And Nandos, I’m going to call you out here. As a very wealthy company you can afford to pay staff to make sure your restaurants are clean rather than expecting staff to do it as a favour after their shts, as a recent BBC investigation found.Your company can also most certainly afford to buy dferent mops and cleaning equipment to be used in the toilets and the kitchen, which staff have said is currently not provided.These very basic standards will help us all as a society and not just in the very urgent fight against a coronavirus pandemic.It’s about having a basic respect for each other. We all want to be healthy and so much of that starts from being clean.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sue, pictured with Harry, says she didn’t realise he was overweight until his hip collapsed. And he had to be taken to hospital for horrible, complex, surgery.Didn’t realise  Gordon Bennett, talk about the elephant in the room. I mean, literally. The kid was half the size of their house. She didn’t notice the lack of exercise and the food Harry was putting away  And the fact that he took up the entire sofa and then some Whose fault is it that Harry needed an op We have an obesity epidemic. It is almost certainly this which has caused a drop in le expectancy in our poorest areas. The first such drop for a century.But now the obesity lobby and the health professionals have decided that obesity shouldn’t be “stigmatised”. Asit were an illness just like any other.Something which happens, without the victim knowing it is happening. This is b******s, and it’s dangerous.And stigma is a useful tool in the fight against obesity.It was only when my own son, during an argument a few years back, told me I was a fat, lardy t***er that I decided to sort my weight out. I’ve put most of it back on now so I need another bout of name-calling to provoke me to more action.My point is that fat-shaming can be very useful.Because being fat isn’t good for us and nor is it good for society. It costs the NHS millions each year. It makes people’s lives a misery. It is right that it should carry a stigma. Remove the stigma and you make being fat the natural state of being, no blame attached.Oh, you’re fat. How did that happen  What terrible bad luck, but never mind. But that is very far from the truth. With the exception of that tiny minority of people who are fat as a consequence of their genes, obesity is eminently and quite easily avoidable.Its main cause, these days, is a lack of exercise. If you’re a mum or dad and your kid is looking a bit porky, get them out for a walk every day, or do some sport with them. And keep an eye on what they are eating.Maybe ration the amount of time they spend online, tapping and swiping away on their fat a***s, pausing only to swallow a bowl of Doritos.This is surely basic parenting. Looking after your kids. Becauseyou don’t do that, they will die very young indeed.And it isn’t the Government that’s to blame. Or blind chance, or bad luck. It is because of lestyle choices. That’s the important word — choices.If you take exercise and keep an eye on what you eat, you won’t get fat and your hip won’t suddenly give up the ghost and collapse.The more we insist, out of kindness, that being fat is no fault of the inidual, the bigger the problem will grow.And now,you’ll excuse me, I have to take the dog for a walk. Four miles.That will lose me about  calories, tops. So still some way to go.INCIDENTALLY, on the subject of these face masks. Me and the family are going away for a few days in April. This will require going to an AIRPORT.Awful places, airports. Full of whacko foreigners who’ve just eaten a stewed bat and wonder why they are feeling a bit under the weather.So I had the following discussion with the missus about whether we should invest in face masks . . .Her: “Trouble is, they don’t work.”Me: “The really expensive ones do, the ones with filters. So they say.”Her: “Oh, right. But we’d look like twats, wouldn’t we ”Me: “Yes, we’d look like twats. No face masks.”That’s the British way. Rather die of pneumonia than look a bit of a twat.We’ve been told that in a worst-case scenario, , British people will die. Almost all of these, according to the experts, are elderly people with serious underlying medical conditions.Just to get this risk thing into perspective – how many of those people would have died anyway, as a consequence of those medical conditions, over the next six months THE “You Can’t Say That!” brigade are at it again.This time they have banned a woman called Selina Todd, pictured, from speaking at the Oxford University International Women’s Festival.Ironically, it was a festive which SHE helped to organise.Todd is an academic and a feminist. She has been barred from speaking because transgender activists don’t like her.They accuse her of being “transphobic”, which she denies. She probably just thinks – like a lot of the population and scientic community – that men who transition to being women are still basically men.We have to fight back against this hysterical tyranny imposed on us all by a tiny, minuscule, rump of deranged activists.It is time institutions such as Oxford University stood up for the principles of freedom of speech.That they fail to do so is a national disgrace.DANNY Baker’s been talking about how the BBC “threw him under a bus.”Baker was sacked for having tweeted a joke about Harry and Meghan and their son, Archie. He was accused of racism. But I doubt there’s a less racist bloke in the country.The BBC should admit it made a big mistake.Not only was it unjust, but I really miss listening to Danny on the radio – he’s a brilliant broadcaster.So here’s a suggestion. Give him Rylan Clark-Neal’s slot on Radio . I can’t be the only person in the country who turns off as soon as I hear him speak.Baker would bring a bit of wit to a network currently lacking it.So whether I like it or not she is now part of my world. Very grateful, thank you. My le is enriched.It seems that Stace is getting tired of “trolls” telling her she’s not bringing up her kids right. Not dressing them in appropriate clothing and stuff.Can’t say I give a monkey’s one way or the other. But I’m not absolutely certain that the best way to convince people you’re an elegant and well-mannered young lady is to take a selfie while you’re laying a cable, you know And then there’s this. She’s annoyed with the trolls right now. But what about when they’ve all gone and started to annoy someone  Who will be left to look at those selfies  Apart from Stacey THERE’S outrage in Darlington over the plight of a bunch of hamsters found in a hedge. Locals are more disgusted than at any time since my band, Dangerbird, played there in .These hamsters were in plastic boxes. And one can only assume they were bred to feed snakes. They have now been liberated. So what are they going to feed the snakes Kale and mung bean risotto  I’m telling you, they won’t like that. The likely answer is mice.So why is that any better than feeding them their cousins, hamsters A spokesmouse for the British Association of Small Rodentstold me yesterday: “It’s ludicrous. Totally inconsistent.Hamsters get away with murder. Because they’ve got chubby little cheeks and are refugees from Syria.“But nobody cares about us mice. And at least we don’t spend half the bloody night running around on a wheel like a moron. Can’t stand hamsters, me.”Anyway, Bob’s half the size of Mount Everest and rushing towards us at nearly ,mph. The experts reckon it will just miss us. But they can’t be exactly sure. Bob could swing by to say hello. In which case you can wear as many face masks as you like but it won’t help you one bit.You can even follow the BBC’s excellent advice on “how to wash your hands”. .Bob won’t care. You’ll be locked away in your self-isolating chamber under the stairs. Hands smothered in Dettol. Poncey face mask bought off Amazon. Stacks of dried food to keep you through the entire spring.And then – bang!

Let’s take him seriously.True, only  Brits are confirmed to have it so far and few caught it in Britain. But that looks certain to soar until the global race for a vaccine bears fruit.It is true too that the vast majority will suffer mild symptoms. But the WHO says the percentage killed may be substantially higher than first thought. How long will the sage advice to wash our hands and stop touching our faces suffice Other nations are scrapping events and closing schools. So far our Queen has put on gloves and the Bond movie has been delayed. We may need more draconian steps sooner rather than later. And one thing is more certain:Covid- is already a monumental global economic shock and likely to worsen.CHANCELLOR Rishi Sunak must listen on fuel duty . . . to Tory backbenchers, small firms and the Sun ­readers.Hiking petrol and diesel taxes, frozen for a decade thanks to our campaign, may seem trivial to Londoners with the Tube and decent buses to rely on.It may even seem logical to increase electric car take-up.The reality outside the capital, and in the former “Red Wall” regions, is it will make working people worse off, will come as a painful blow to van drivers and a bombshell for truckers.And they won’t respond by spending £, on a battery-powered runabout they’ll need to charge every few miles.They will suffer it grimly, pass on the cost to customersthey can and resent that their new Tory Chancellor, as his first act, made their lives tougher.IT’S time for some perspective on Britain’s role in mitigating climate change.From all the Extinction Rebellion protests you might imagine we were among the world’s worst polluters. In fact our carbon footprint is its smallest since .Far from “doing nothing”, as Greta Thunberg claims, our emissions are down  per cent in a decade.Two per cent of our power comes from coal. In Germany it’s  — and China and India are building scores of new coal-burning plants.Heathrow’s expansion has been halted while they build HUNDREDS of new airports.And while we introduce bans and taxes that make Britain cleaner but threaten our prosperity, the world’s mega-polluters carry on regardless.Green campaigners should target those with the worst record, not one of the best.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Yesterday it was revealed that thousands of Universal Credit claimants will be given a guaranteed one-off payment when they hit state pension age - fixing a loophole in the system.Campaigners had argued that the flaw pushed some elderly benefit claimants into poverty by leaving them without money for up to nine weeks.Under the new rules, the government says Universal Credit claimants who reach state pension age “will receive a run-on” of a one-off payment.Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Therese Coffey says this will benefit approximately , pensioners over the next five years.Each person will get an average of £ from the one-off payment, she said, at a cost of £million to the government.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the Queen is nothingnot practical.She has learned the lessons of the unedying exits of Princess Diana and the Duchess of York from The Firm and won’t make the same mistake this time.That’s why she quite beautully told Harry:  “You are much loved and will always be welcomed back” — a line that brings tears to the eyes of a  soppy old monarchist like me.The Queen has not accepted that Megxit is permanent and probably never will. Harry needs some time away to explore and live a le where he isn’t playing second fiddle to his father and brother.Duty and the love of his country might just pull him back soon, she hopes.But perhaps the Queen hasn’t factored in the persuasiveness and passion of Meghan — a truly modern woman with very dferent plans for her husband and their “brand”.SOMETHING Kinda Woohoo as Girls Aloud fans like me got fresh hope this week.One of the main obstacles preventing the chart-topping band reuniting has been the feud between the lovely Nadine Coyle and some of the other members.But Kimberley Walsh met Nadine this week and they seemed to be getting along just fine. Of course, the real battle will be getting Cheryl Tweedy on board.Although with her last single peaking at No, I think she might be willing to kiss and make up with Nads too. As the Pussycat Dolls have proven, there’s nothing like an enormous cheque to help smooth over bitter relations.After all, a high-profile pregnancy and cute baby being born at No always lts our collective spirits, right Similar sentiments were expressed when Tony Blair and David Cameron said  their wives were expecting while PM.  The pregnancies of Kate and Meghan were widely celebrated, too.But we are  gripped by a nasty culture war driven by social media.So after the happy announcement, Twitter once again became a hateful cesspit where apparently respectable professionals found despicable ways to slag off a young woman expecting her first baby, to a man she loves, and spout pathetic conspiracy theories.Ironically, many  were  the same crew who have been banging on for  weeks about the need to be kind to those in the public eye.But those rules instituted by the London liberal keyboard warriors only applyyou have the same political views as they do.If you are a Tory or a Brexiteer, or on the right or work for a popular newspaper, you are such an abhorrent human being in the eyes of the likes of Alastair Campbell and Jameela Jamil that you can be torn to shreds without a hint of irony from the perpetrators who are no better than abusive trolls.THE idea that over-weight people need reminding that they’re the  F-wordis nonsensical.If you have been obese and still battle the bulge every day, you’ll know that being the F-word is inside your head every minute.That’s why I embrace the idea put forward in the Pledge To Eradicate Weight Stigma, by Professor Francesco Rubino, from King’s College London, that describing people as fat, overweight and obese is just as debilitating as a racial slur in .Skinny folk convincing themselves that overweight people are McDonald’s-obsessed lazy slobs is offensive and wrong.And that type of outdated approach will do nothing to solve our obesity epidemic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No wonder, when London has had three times as much transport funding as the rest of England.It is great that the former Red Wall seats which handed the Tories power have forced them to prioritise our “left behind” regions.But it remains scandalous that instead of increasing their productivity, Labour and Tory Governments let them fall even further behind.That ide has become a chasm which our new Chancellor must close.FLYBE’S collapse is a tragedy for its workers and those at airports reliant on it. But it is right that taxpayers did not bail it out.The firm was badly run, was operating on a wing and a prayer and was finally ruined when coronavirus — which has now claimed its first le in Britain — suddenly destroyed demand.Some of its routes are vital to the economy. Those can be subsidised and offered to rivals under public service rules. Others will be snapped up tooenough passengers make them viable.But Labour’s call, for virtually any job losses anywhere to be rescued using public money, is the road to national ruin.FOR three years MPs and their rogue Speaker brought Parliament to its knees by refusing to honour the Brexit vote.Some stuck two fingers up at their own Leave-voting electorates. And while many of the worst offenders were booted out in last December’s election, plenty on the Labour benches survived.Now they are rewarded with a pay rise to nearly £, a year. Inflation is just . per cent. Their hike is . per cent.How can that be justied They all but destroyed the reputation of the Commons. Now they are sitting pretty on salaries three times the national average, plus perks galore.Far too few are worth anything like it.THE growing of lettuce in space is fantastic news for the historic manned Mars mission we may see within  years.It means astronauts can munch fresh leaves, and maybe tomatoes and peppers, all the way to the Red Planet.If they run out, there’s always Mars bars. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I feel a bit mean about it, because my kids love going, but it seems like an unnecessary risk to take at the moment.Im really worried about them picking up the coronavirus there.One concerned parent posted on Mumsnet: I certainly wouldnt be going anywhere near soft play.Those places are virtually incubation centres at the best of times.Others told of their plans to avoid swimming, public transport and definitely soft play in a bid to swerve the virus.Mum Rachel Shiel, who visited New Adventurelands with her children on Tuesday, admitted she was concerned about the situation.She told the Sun Online: I think Ill be more cautious now about going to soft play areas with my children.But I think as long as the necessary precautions are followed, such as washing hands, then Im going to carry on as normal.Thats not just for me, but for the sake of my children - I dont want to take something away from them that I know they enjoyI dont have to.Currently, no soft play centre has announced plans to temporarily close.Bosses at some of the venues have told Sun Online theyre installing more hand sanitisers in a bid to keep the deadly bug at bay.Bosses at Public Health England say their main advice to parents is simply to keep tots hands clean.Professor Robert Dingwall, of Nottingham Trent University, said closing play centres wont stop children meeting in other, less clean settings.He said: That may actually be less safe.For as yet unexplained reasons, small children dont seem to be particularly vulnerable to Covid- or to be superspreaders in the way they are for the influenza virus.The risks to themselves and others are, then, low - relative to the risks posed by adults.Askedparents themselves should steer clear, the professor said: People should not stay away from play centres because theyre afraid of catching the virus.If they have been exposed to the virus where, then it would be sensible to stay away out of respect to other parents and children.Today, a second coronavirus victim is feared to have died at a hospital in Milton Keynes as the total number of cases across the UK jumped to .The Department of Health confirmed the bug is spreading at its fastest rate yet as a total of  people tested positive in the last  hours.In a statement, bosses at New Adventurelands said they were told by Public Health England officials there is no ongoing risk to customers.Last year, we reported that ball pit play areas are riddled with dozens of killer germs because theyre not cleaned for weeks.Researchers examined six ball areas used by autistic children across the US state of Georgia, finding potentially fatal bacteria present in every environment."},{"url":null,"title":"can you spot sneaky snake","story":"Snake catcher Tony Morrison, , from Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, was called out to remove the Green Tree snake after the surreptitious reptile had wrapped itself tightly inside the house.Tony – who has been a snake catcher for  years – added thatleft undisturbed, the snake might have stayed inside the shoe for days.He said: This one takes the old saying check your shoes before you put them on to a whole new level.The lady spotted the snake inside the shoe in her house in their hallway, she was hysterical on the phone to me to hurry up and remove it.The snake was a Green Tree Snake which thankfully is not a venomous species, but they do pack a nasty bite.These snakes are a fairly common species and often find their way into houses.Tony added: I guess in Australia not only do you need to check where you walk, but now you need to check what you walk in.The snake was unharmed and later released it into nearby countryside.He added: Once I removed the snake from the shoe it was released into bushland shortly after.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The level of uncertainty means it is unwise for it to attempt to settle the big questions on tax, spending and borrowing.One influential Tory source tells me that: “You can’t do spectacular, interesting stuff during corona. But you can do boring and dficult things.”The Budget will concentrate on delivering the Tories’ election promises. Inside the Treasury it has been dubbed the “Manesto Budget”.It will contain changes to ensure that more infrastructure projects are built outside London and the South East, there will be a “Union connectivity” project launched to better link up England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — expect Boris’s bridge to get a mention — it will green-light a slew of road projects, provide money for fast broadband and increase funding for research.It will also curb the entrepreneurs’ tax relief that has turned from being an encouragement to take a risk on a new business to a general form of tax relief for wealthy investors.The Budget will also seek to emphasise that, despite the undoubted, short-term disruption the coronavirus will cause, the medium-term future for the economy is pretty rosy.Unlike with the  financial crash, the economy will rebound strongly once the virus has passed.There is, though, a big debate going on in government about how much the Government should do to help iniduals and businesses through the corona downturn.The rise in the number of people in the UK who are their own boss means there are more than four million workers not entitled to sick pay.The Government will, almost certainly, offer these people more time to pay their taxes. But what more it should do is the subject of growing debate in Whitehall.One of those involved in these discussions points out: “We can’t pay for the whole gig economy for the next six months.”A minister argues that people can get an advance from universal credit within two days in urgent cases. They fear thatthe Government starts paying the wages of the self-employed, then it will be hard to see where it should stop.They point out that a plumber who earns £, a week now, will almost certainly lose money as the virus spreads. Should the State make that up Coronavirus will change the way we live over the next few months, at the very least.But the challenge for the Government is to ensure that work on everything  doesn’t cease while the country tries to fight this crisis.It still has a job of work to do to get the country ready for le outside the EU and to prepare the economy for the great changes that technology is about to bring.BORIS JOHNSON is determined to defend Priti Patel, his Home Secretary, who is facing ious allegations of bullying from civil servants.Internally, he has given short shrt to those who have suggested he distance himself from her.There is a view in Downing Street that several of the most dramatic charges against her don’t stack up.They also claim that these concerns about Patel’s behaviour were not expressed as official complaints at the time.They, “didn’t reach up at a formal level”, I’m told.No knows, though, that it has a fight on its hands to save Patel.One source tells me: “Yes, she can survive. But there’s no smoke without fire. It is shaping up to be quite a big struggle.”Part of the issue is that there is a view among senior civil servants that, given that the top civil servant at the Home Office has quit because of this row, Patel should go too.But Downing Street know thatPatel goes, it would become harder to push reform through the system.One of those at the heart of government tells me: “You can’t have a situation where civil servants get to determine who their Secretary of State is.”The next hurdle for Patel to clear is Sir Alex Allan’s inquiry into whether her behaviour breached the ministerial code.There is a quiet confidence among her allies that while she will receive some criticism from his report, she won’t be found guilty of breaching the code.Buther former Permanent Secretary Sir Philip Rutnam really is determined to take his case to an employment tribunal, then the situation will become far more dficult for the Home Secretary.THERE’S a new political ide: Do you still shake hands or have you started bumping elbows to try to reduce your risk of contacting coronavirus Boris Johnson is still very much a hand-shaker, as is the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock.But some other Cabinet ministers have taken to either nodding politely or bumping elbows.As one of those close to the talks put it: “We’ve told them what we think. Their illusions are disappearing rapidly.”The question now is whether when the EU negotiators turn up in London in less than two weeks’ time, they come with a dferent approach or carry on pushing these ideas.THE local elections in May might have to be postponed because of coronavirus.If the UK’s response to the outbreak is still in the delay phase, continuing with the contests would go against that advice, as it would bring large numbers of people into contact with each other.I understand this option is being discussed in Whitehall, but no decision has been taken.But as one figure in government points out: “We postponed a General Election once because of an epidemic.”The  General Election was pushed back to June from May because of foot-and-mouth disease.Delaying the elections – which will see mayors elected in London, the West Midlands and Manchester among other races – would be a big step, and one the Government would only take with the utmost reluctance.The next few weeks will tell us whether it is necessary or not.- James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA mum has spoken out about how her autistic son, , was bullied so severely she had to pull him out of school. Leanne Fernandez, , whose son Harrison also lives with aspergeraposs syndrome, says he was beaten by a group of classmates at Colchester Academy every day for nearly three months.It meant he regularly came home in tears and unable to understand why he was being picked on, also led to him self-harming, Essex Live reports.Four of the incidents were so horric that they had to be reported to police, eventually leaving Leanne feeling it was no longer safe for her son to attend school. As a result, Harrison has not attended classes since November. The bullying - initially verbal - started within hour of Harrisonaposs first day at secondary school on September  last year, Leanne says. Obviously it all started off verbally with them saying he was gay, he walked gay, he looked gay, he talked gay, she explains. But on the second day, it escalated to physical. They tried apospeanut-ingapos the tie and it came off and they started pushing him and it continued out of school. He has had orange juice poured down the back of his neck, food taken away from him, had three of them pushing him at one time. Over the next following weeks, the violence escalated, leaving Harrison - who had started secondary school keen to make friends and learn - with a bruised and swollen face, ripped clothes and bloodied knees.  A group of boys regularly targeted her son on a daily basis, Leanne claims, including waiting to catch him in between classes and punch him in the groin. They would also make threats. One child threatened him when he saw him and said aposwe are looking for you and said aposwe are going to stamp on your skullapos. Thataposs not a normal thing for a -year-old to say, she continued. It is really upsetting for him. He had just started school and he is asking aposwhy they have they got a problem with me apos When you go in to school every single day and a number of them are going up to him between classes punching him in the groin. Itaposs awful.  Leanne first contacted police on September , telling them that on the third day of year seven Harrison had been physically hurt. She called officers again on September , and told them he was beaten by another child. They were called again for a third incident on September  when Leanne had picked him up from school. She was a little late and asked him to meet her in the car park, just outside the school. She said: I pulled up in the car park and I said come out of reception to the car and he said yes. While I was waiting for him, they beat him up. They had waited outside reception for him.  Iaposm sat thinking heaposs waiting in reception but actually heaposs getting beaten up. Leanne said the school had given Harrison early passes so he could leave class and school early. The aim, she said, was that he could try and avoid bullies travelling to other classes, or them catching him at the end of the day. He would also be sent to the sensory room or the library at break times or lunch times, in the hope to keep him away from the bullies. He was even being told to go there break and lunch times so they didnapost hurt him, she said. He had to go classes five minutes earlier than the others so that he could get there before them or they would punch him in the groin. He would come home and cry and say itaposs too much to handle. He just wants to go to school. Heaposs been beaten to a pulp. Harrison retaliated to the bullies and punched back after everything became too much. Harrison punched back once because he had had enough. But he never stuck up for himself again because he didnapost want to get in trouble and then it was worse because he was just getting pure beaten, Leanne said. But the final straw was on November , when she called police for a final time. He was going to the library or sensory room to eat his lunch and as he went down the stairwell and there were five of them waiting for him, she stated. One boy rushed up to him put him in a head lock so he was facing down and kept punching him. He then went crying and rushed to the toilet. They kept him in the toilet and he said a teacher was standing guard of it. They didnapost get the boys and take them to a room. Why didnapost they take him to the medical bay  Even though pupils arenapost allowed phones at school, Leanne had given Harrison one in case he got hurt again. She says that he texted her a picture from inside the toilet, with a picture of his face already swollen. He messaged her, aposMum theyaposve really hurt me, Iaposm scared.apos Leanne, who works as a child minder, says she had to pack up her and the kids as quickly as possible and contact their parents to tell them she was going to get her son. The effect everything has had on Harrison has been huge. Thereaposs been so many failings, itaposs ridiculous. I said no more, he couldnapost be there without harm, the mum claimed.He has a doctoraposs note to say itaposs detrimental effect to be in school. Because of his needs, like his  OCD , which is not flicking light switches itaposs his thoughts, he is a perfectionist and has severe anxiety so he takes it all out on himself.He self harms for not being perfect. He struggles with himself anyway, so with this he is coming home thinking heaposs in trouble, no one likes him and heaposs not good enough. He just wants some friends. Children with autism struggle with social things anyway and feel isolated so to not go to school and be at home with me alone all day is not good. He only gets two hours of learning. His mother has fought for him to attend another school - and Harrison is now due to start at the Phillip Morant School, also in Colchester, next week. Colchester Academy says that keeping its student safe is its highest priority. Principal Jenny Betts said: I cannot comment on inidual cases. However, keeping our students safe is our highest priority, which includes dealing swtly with any incidents of alleged bullying.  We follow clear behavioural procedures and use any appropriate sanctions we have available.

Now, on atrip to Australia, Rob, from Bideford, Devon, has won best international mullet at the annual Mulletfest, held in Kurri Kurri, New South Wales. Rob said: “I was coming out here for a skateboarding competition and it just happened to time with me being out here for that so I could go out to Kurri Kurri and see the mullet fest itself. “There was eight of us from all over the globe, it was good fun. A good laugh. “Three years ago I came over to Australia got a mullet haircut, chopped it up in irony really. “I’ve never been a fan of the mullet or the rats tail, but I have to say I do like the mullet now so my point of view has changed dramatically. “It genuinely feels like it’s been a religious ceremony for me, Australia - you’ve been amazing.” Rob said that his hair is currently down to his shoulder blades, and growing a good mullet takes: “Time and patience, and being able to handle a s**t ton of negative feedback.” Mulletfest is an annual event that honours the best mullet cuts in ious styles and categories, including everyday, grubby, vintage, and extreme, among others. Their website states: “All competition entrants are judged on their haircut, overall presentation and stage presence.”The winner of the illustrious ‘Best Mullet of them All’ category is crowned on the day. Rob added: “It was actually amazing, I was so stoked. There were  entries, eight of which actually turned up. “The standard was way higher than I had first envisioned. “I won the ‘international’ category, so I have the best ‘international’ mullet. “You couldn’t print a lot of the comments I get. The most PC one is ‘you look like an s pornstar’ "},{"url":null,"title":"celebs politicians back mirror campaign","story":"NewsCelebs and politicians back Mirror campaign to lt , kids out of povertyCoronation Streets Julie Hesmondhalgh, actor Steven Berkoff, comedian Jason Manford and former Home Secretary Alan Johnson were just a few of those to back the Daily Mirrors child poverty campaignShareCommentsByMatthew Dresch:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video give-five-campaign-lts-lid-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news celebs-politicians-back-mirror-campaign-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations Dr Richard Hatchett said the virus had the potential to spread to % of the population worldwide. He said: I think the threat is very signicant. The potential of the virus is demonstrated in china and demonstrated in Italy and Iran. There were three cases in Italy two weeks ago - yesterday there were over ,. Speaking about how China has responded to the outbreak, he said: It is like they are at war with the virus - all of society is mobilised in the fight against the virus. On the UKaposs fight to halt the spread, he added: We have to recognise the virus is here and it has tremendous potential to be disruptive and to cause high rates of illness or even death - but that is not a future that is locked in. Contact tracing is very imp - voluntary quarantine of contacts and isolation of cases is very imp - there may be a time to close schools. We know that schools are amplication points in society - attack rates are much higher in children and the elderly. Children have been minimally affected by COVID- whats unclear is whether they have been infected and handled the infections well or maybe they are not being affected. Dr Hatchett suggested the virus may have been in the UK for weeks before it was detected. He added: If you look at places where death has occurred - England now falls into that category - a death signies circulation of the virus that has been going on for at least weeks.  It takes time for people to get sick, go to the hospital and expire - the virus has been circulating here for some time. I think the most concerning thing is the combination of infectiousness and the ability to cause disease and death. Not since , the Spanish flu - have we seen a virus combining these qualities in this way. What happens with this virus is up to us - I do think this has the potential to cause a global pandemic. To tackle the spread, Dr Hatchett said we need to work collectively as a society in our prevention and not think of our own, personal risk only. He added: We need to start thinking of the social risk- we need to all think about our responsibility to each other. We cant view the epidemic in terms of our person risk- we need to act collectively.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailScientists around the world are working together in the race to find a coronavirus vaccine although it is feared it could take at least a year. Researchers at Imperial College London and Oxford and Cam­­bridge universities are among the experts toiling around the clock. Imperial have prototypes in early trials and will move to human trials as early as next month. The college’s Prof Robin Shattock said: “We have the technology to generate a vaccine with a speed that’s never been realised before. “Most vaccines take five years in the discovery phase and at least one to two years to manufacture and get into clinical trials. “We are trying to short-track that and we may not be the first – it requires only one group to get there.”  In America, Seattle biotech firm Moderna is recruiting  volunteers to test its experimental vaccine and in Pennsylvania Inovio is developing a DNA-based vac­­cine, producing , doses for trials next month. In India, Zydus Cadila aims to manipulate a measles virus to produce antibodies against corona while in China four teams are using immune-activating technology from a Florida firm. Denmark’s Expresion is using insect cells to tackle the problem while researchers in Queensland, Aus­­tralia, are using a “molecular clamp”.  PM Boris John­­son yesterday pled­ged a fur­­ther £mil­­lion for research to fight the virus. He announ­­­ced the fund­ing during a tour of the Mol­­ogic lab in Bed­­fordshire which is working on a quick and cheap way to diagnose patients. In a statement he said: “Keeping people safe is my number one priority and that’s why I’ve set out our four-part plan to contain, delay, mitigate and research coronavirus.  “We are ensuring the country is prepared for the current outbreak, guided by the science at every stage. But we also need to invest in researching the vaccines that could prevent future outbreaks. “I’m very proud that UK experts – backed by Government funding – are on the front line of global efforts to do just that.” Speaking to reporters, Mr Johnson added: “What we are announcing today is a £million package of investment which will in time deliver a vaccine – some say in about a year – but also help us to have rapid test kits that anyone can use quickly to tell whether they have coronavirus.”  The PM warned of a “substantial period of disruption”. Asked what help would be given to struggling firms, he said next week’s budget presented “a big opportunity”. Scientists have learned lessons from previous virus outbreaks – such as the  Sars crisis – and already had a game plan when the full gravity of corona emerged. Within days of the outbreak in China a genetic blueprint of the virus was put online using samples from early patients. It provided a road map for scientists around the world to create a vaccine.  This kind of research is usually highly competitive and secretive. In the past, medical journals would only publish research which was exclusive. But with this outbreak they have promised that sharing data online will not hinder later publication.  As a consequence dozens of teams around the world are collaborating in a way never before seen. For decades, the main way of creating a vaccine has been by using the original virus. The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, for example, uses weakened versions of those bugs.  But work on coronavirus uses newer, faster approaches including lting small sections of the virus’s genetic code and putting them into other, harmless, infections. Oxford University is using a technique it was already working on to combat Mers. Other experts are pinning their hopes on repurposing drugs used to fight HIV and malaria which have already gone through safety checks.  Remdesivir, used against Ebola, is also being tested. Moderna’s Seattle project is being work­­ed on by  people. Boss Richard Hatchett said: “After our call for proposals in February we had  applications from all over the world. “There is a real urgency because the threat is unprecedented in  years.” Even so, creating a vaccine remains a y process due to the cost and labour, plus the need for testing. It took years to develop a vaccine for Ebola, which killed more than , in West Africa just over a decade ago. Experts believe a viable coronavirus vaccine is a year to  months away, which may sound a long time but would in fact be a new record.

Michael Dorsett made the horrying discovery in Hythe, near Southampton, on Thursday at around pm. The retired HGV driver found the baby when he was walking his collie cross through the wooded area and saw a aposlittle bundleapos on the ground. He said: I thought about the poor child all yesterday afternoon, all last night and then I woke up early this morning thinking about it. I havenapost stopped thinking about it. The -year-old, who is helping police with enquiries, also said: I quite often walk the dog through that area of woods, even though you are probably not supposed to be in there because itaposs private. I saw something wrapped in a towel, lying by the bottom of a tree and I thought somebody had dumped a dead cat or a dead dog and then I saw a little arm or something sticking out. I peeled back the towel to have a look and I saw immediately it was a baby so I touched his face gently with the back of my finger and it was ice cold so I knew he had to be dead. I walked home straight away, really quickly. I spoke to the police on the phone and they came down and I showed them where the baby was. There was only a small bit of his face exposed, I donapost know how long he had been there but it canapost have been longer than a few hours. Initially I was concerned the mother might have left him there and gone off and done something to herself but there was no sign of anybody  around.  It was horrible. I didnapost look in much detail, I was just hoping the mother was OK really. Two snfer dogs and a team of half a dozen police officers with metal poles today examined the woodland in search of clues. A retired painter and decorator who rents an area of farmland near the woodland also spoke today about the aposterribleapos discovery. He said: I saw a load of police cars here yesterday at around pm and all these people in white overalls heading into the woods. Itaposs just terrible to find a baby here, I wonder whataposs happened to the poor mother. It has been really shocking for all of us who live here. In my opinion, it must be someone local because that area is not somewhere people normally go.  Hampshire Police say their priority is finding the mother. Detective Chief Inspector Ross Toms said: I have no doubt this will have been a very distressing experience for the mother of this baby. Our priority right now is to ensure she receives the care and assistance she requires. I want to make a direct appeal to her. You may be very frightened right now and it is vitally important that you make contact with us or someone . You may not want to contact the police and I understand that. If that is the case, I want to urge you to seek assistance from a healthcare professional or to attend a hospital as soon as possible. Our priority is ensuring you receive the right support.

Here in an exclusive extract from his new book, Long Way Home, he recalls some moments that helped shape him... I wouldn’t necessarily recommend the coping box as a strategy for others but it somehow saw me through the toughest of times. It was a Colour Sergeant who ­introduced us to the concept. He said: “The way I’ve always got myself through is by putting all my worries in a box – what I call a coping box. “When you’re in the heat of an ­operation, when your mates are being killed and maimed, you don’t have time to grieve, don’t have time to think too deeply about what’s happening. “You just have to get on with it. Better to store it all away in that box and deal with it later. “When you get back, maybe then you can open it up and deal with it.” I first used it in the war in Kosovo. We were dropped by helicopter into an area that had been occupied by Serbian forces. There was something about the place that immediately struck me as not being right. I just got a sense that we had arrived at somewhere that had witnessed horrors. As we neared the village we saw a young woman walking towards us. There was a terrible sadness in her dark eyes and a haunted expression on her face. I couldn’t tellshe was afraid of us or of who had been there before. Or both. As I was considering whether to call to her, there was a message from the lead section that they had found something. I watched the woman disappear like a ghost into the trees. Called forward to ­examine the find, I ­discovered it was a pit about the size of a single-decker bus on its side. It had been covered with a mound of earth. It looked like it might be a mass grave. I walked cautiously up to it, wonderingit might be booby-trapped, and knelt beside it. Something smelt very bad. Then something caught my eye – protruding out of the mound a couple of metres on from where I was. I could feel my heart pumping. I looked more closely. There could be no mistake – it was a human hand sticking out of the dirt. I edged closer, my eyes fixed upon it.  On the wrist of the hand was a watch. It was still ticking. I wondered about the woman I passed earlier. What horrors might she have witnessed or suffered  I tried not to think about the watch, or the hand, or what was attached to it, and what  was hidden in the mound. I tried to put out of my mind the very distinctive stench of death and the haunted young woman’s face. Into the coping box it all went and I got on with what we were doing. After the war, le carried on and deployments around the world followed. Then, in , I met Caroline. I fell in love very quickly and it wasn’t long before I asked her to marry me. Over the next few years we had a son and daughter and while le in the Army with two small kids was rarely quiet, we were happy and hope­ful. But in April  the unimaginable happened: Caroline was diagnosed with bowel cancer. Although we had come to understand there was some minor problem, the thought it might be cancer just hadn’t crossed our minds. And now, from nowhere, completely unexpectedly, the C-word was being used. Caroline was very upset but quickly regained her composure. I had decided to be as ruthlessly positive as I could possibly be. I didn’t want to unmask the terrible fear I felt be­­­cause I knew I had to be strong for her.  We agreed both to stay as positive as possible. I tried to cope by being useful and keeping busy. But I was angry. Angry that Caroline, of all people, was having to go through this ordeal. I was desperately frustrated that there wasn’t anything I could really do to make it go away. There was an all-consuming feeling of powerlessness and it proved very dficult to manage. For once I didn’t feel I could just put it in my coping box. Surgeons thought an operation had got all the cancer but in  it ­­re­­­­- turned. Chemotherapy was prescribed and Caroline began a punishing routine which continued until early . Her health continued to deteriorate. I never ever gave up but there came a moment when I had to acknowledge where this was leading. I had to start accepting that the cancer was probably going to win. That it would take her from me. That I would lose her. That I would be left on my own with the kids. I had always looked around the cor­­­ner to think about what was coming next and to try and get ready for it. But, for the first time, I couldn’t bear to look round that next corner, nor was I able to shove it in my coping box. Maybe the box was full or maybe this didn’t belong in the box. I don’t know which – I just knew I couldn’t discard the worry in the way I always had. I steeled myself. The final few weeks were awful. I was caring for Caroline at home with support from a nurse who came in every day.  We strove to maintain the normal routine with me getting the kids ready for school and then bringing Caroline downstairs, where I would make her as comfortable as possible. On a beautully fresh summer’s morning at the end of June we made it out into the garden and sat in deckchairs with a coffee. Caroline had her sunglasses on and, despite everything she had endured, was still beautul, graceful and delightful company. We enjoyed the sunshine and each other’s company and I took the opportunity to tell her how much I loved her. Caroline noticed a stirring in the little rose bed by the side of the house. It was a mole. Gradually it worked its way to the surface and popped its sleepy head out. It paused, asto enjoy the lovely sunshine, before deciding that it was perhaps better off underground. ­ Caroline recounted the tale to the children when they ed from school and was as excited to tell them about it as they were to hear it. It was the last time I saw her smile. In the weeks that followed she declined with terrying speed.  On a Friday morning in July Caroline became very short of breath. An ambulance came and took her away. I sat by her hospital bedside for several hours. All day I could see and feel Caroline sliding away. I sat holding her hand all night and for most of the following day. That afternoon I could feel her going and at .pm she died. I had no idea what to do. I sat with her for a while. Despite all the time I had spent thinking about it, trying to prepare myself for this moment, I wasn’t ready. Eventually, I thanked the staff for their care and walked slowly out. I was holding a small plastic bag containing Caroline’s belongings – her dressing gown and a washbag I’d made up with a few toiletries. I’d arrived at the hospital with my we. I was leaving with a plastic bag. I drove back to our house, opened the front door and walked in. That’s when the magnitude of it hit me – like a shock wave washing over me, a force field of anguish and hurt. I walked into the kids’ bedroom and sobbed uncontrollably.

But due to coronavirus fears, Amanda, , said parents have been given the dficult choice of sending children abroad or risk losing half of the money paid.The mum, from Dovecot, told the Liverpool Echo it has been extremely hard to save up for the trip.She said: Since the news of the outbreak of the coronavirus in Italy was released, a group of mothers from Liverpool, including myself, have scrambled for a bit of hope that we would be refunded for the trip we have paid nearly £ for. We fully understand about the borders needing to be closed to be eligible for a full refund, but what sort of position does that leave a parent in  She added: I want all of my money back that Iaposve saved hard for all year round for. Why should I have to lose half my money when this is going on all over the world  Weaposre all trying to do as much as we can.  Liverpoolaposs St Paulaposs Jnr School, St Anthony of Padua, Mab Lane Primary School, All Saints school and Emmaus school are all set to go on a ski trip on March . A council spokeswoman said advice remains that travel is still allowed to these areas, but she understandsparents want to withdraw their children from going abroad. But Amanda said she was terried the borders would close while her daughter was awaythe coronavirus situation worsens in the coming weeks, and the year six pupil would be stranded. She said: I believe no parent would send their -year-old child to a strange country where people are dying daily and the numbers are rising rapidly.  The mother-of-two said she also has a two-year-old son and fears the worstAmeila had to come home and self-isolate from the trip. Amanda says parents were given until Friday, March , to decidethey would send their children abroad. If they chose not to, they would receive only half their money back, she said.

It is not the le this bright -year-old envisaged, or chose, for herself. Bodhi wasn’t planned and, although Hannah is still in a relationship with his father she does not live with him and he can only offer piecemeal financial support as he volunteers at a not-for-profit art gallery and does not claim benefits. Hannah, who lives in Middlesbrough, used to work full-time at a bank but says because of childcare costs she cannotto work until Bodhi is three, and eligible for a free nursery place. Hannah’s benefits do not cover her outgoings and she only scrapes by thanks to family and friends. Hannah spoke to the Mirror as we launch our Give Me Five campaign . We are calling on Boris Johnson to increase child benefit by £ a week to end the scourge of child poverty. Are you a parent struggling with poverty  Email webnews@mirror Figures from the End Child Poverty coalition show around % of children are growing up poor in the North East. In Middlesbrough alone there are an estimated ,. We spent Tuesday, March , with Hannah and Bodhi... .am Cuddled up to his mummy, Bodhi’s sleep-encrusted eyes flicker open to the familiar sight of a bare bedroom wall speckled with a grey shadow of mould. The wall is bare because Hannah fears drilling into the damp plaster to hang cheerful pictures or put up shelves. Bodhi’s streaming nose is cold. Outside, it is around C and in here little more. He has woken early because he is poorly with a cold which has lingered for two weeks. The waiting list for social housing is so long, Hannah rents her home from a private landlord, the cost covered partly by housing benefit. The property is not in good repair. Plastic bags are stuffed in holes for “insulation”, the radiator in the bedroom only heats halfway, a saucepan sits on the landing to catch drips from the attic. Setting her heating to come on before she and Bodhi wake up is unthinkable. Read more about our Give Me Five campaign  Hannah says: “People even set the thermostat to come on during the night. Can you imagine ” Her solution is to bring Bodhi into bed with her. She can, at least, provide body heat for her little boy. Today, there is another problem. They must try to do without heating because Hannah has just p in her account and her gas meter, which is perched on the top of her fridge, reads just £.. That will only buy a couple of hours at most and in this drafty Victorian semi it takes at least an hour for the heating to be felt. To sign our petition calling on Boris Johnson to increase child benefit click here Her weekly child tax credits of £ will not land until half-past midnight, so she must save her precious gas until the evening, when the darkness makes the house even colder. Hannah tries to keep Bodhi snuggling beneath the covers but he is restless, so she wraps him in a fluffy dressing gown with a bear face on the hood and braves downstairs. Sadly, her own dressing gown is stained and can’t be washed because her machine has packed up. am  Bodhi clambers on a cushion that reads Dream Big Little One. He has had a sweet waffle for breakfast – Hannah can buy a five-pack for just p so they have become a staple. Hannah hasn’t eaten. “I’m used to not eating during the day,” she says. She has even gone two days without. It helps the food stretch. Bodhi gurgles happily, making joyful sounds, but he doesn’t talk. Hannah blames herself. “I haven’t been able to socialise him enough.” She can’t afford playgroups very often and says: “The cheapest group is £ but some days that’s the dference between a loaf of bread or not.” There’s another reason she finds herself avoiding them, too. Embarrassment. She can’t afford a coffee with the other mums, hasn’t bought new clothes since Bodhi was born and only owns one pair of shoes. She admits she has been a week without using deodorant. Now she has started to feel anxiety rise when she’s outside the home. Her faded canvas bag reads Yummy Mummy but she feels far from it. .am Hannah is crying. Her local councillor, who has also become a friend because of the volunteering Hannah does, has called round with an envelope. Inside is £, collected by a group of mums so that Hannah can buy a second-hand washing machine. A wave of relief and gratitude trumps embarrassment. Hannah is hardened to asking for help. Frantic WhatsApp messages to her mum asking for £ top-ups to her account, accepting her sister’s offer to pay for Bodhi’s birthday party. But this time, she didn’t ask. Hannah says: “I only survive because of my friends and my family. Because I have them, I’ll never regard myself as poor.” pm Spring sunshine dapples the lounge’s uneven carpet tiles but Bodhi and Hannah remain inside. Bodhi is mesmerised by cartoons. They spend a lot of time indoors, TV on. There aren’t many free options for going out, especially in winter.  And with no car, and buses costing £., Hannah can’t go far. She says: “Some days he doesn’t go out the front door, I feel sad and guilty.” Today though, there is another reason to stay in. Hannah is waiting for the landlord. She has been asking for repairs since she moved in and is desperate for the bedroom radiator to be fixed, and a radiator to be fitted in the bathroom. She says: “When I bath Bodhi it gets so cold I have to keep the shower running, for steam.” But what she loathes most is the “garden”. A pipe which carries waste water from the toilet and household appliances is leaking in one corner. A film of white scum covers the mud. There is no way Bodhi can play here. The Home Sweet Home sign on the lounge wall rings hollow. .pm Bodhi flashes a cheeky grin as he clambers on top of a gravestone. We are in a nearby cemetery. Hannah comes here most days. This is Bodhi’s garden. Hannah explains that the nearest park,  minutes away, is frequented by drug-users. The cemetery is beautul but there isn’t another child in sight. Bodhi is having a ball but a two-year-old should not have to make a graveyard his playground. .pm Bodhi is having omelette for tea, again. Hannah contemplates spending some of the washing machine money on something dferent but she stops herself. She has a couple of eggs, a tin of tuna, and cheese – “a luxury”.  pm Every corner of the house is icy cold. Hannah stares bleakly at bread, cheese, days-old lettuce and grapes – the only fresh ingredients she has. She snaps. She takes a note from the washing machine fund and pops to the shop to top up her gas by a couple more quid. She finds it “mortying” doing this in person and usually uses a phone app to save face.

They were there to honour the achievements of wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women who have taken part in remarkable sporting and adventure challenges over the last year. But all eyes were on Meghan, , who has not been seen in this country since she and Harry made the dramatic announcement that they were quitting public le in early January, much to the distress of the Queen. She upped the glamour stakes in heavy make up and a form fitting turquoise dress by British designer Victoria Beckham, with blue suede heels and gold earring. Her hair was tied back in a pony tail.Harry, who has been made to give up his official patronages after deciding to move to Canada, is being allowed to retain his private links with organisations such as The Endeavour Fund, of which he is patron.The charity supports service personnel keen to use challenges to help with their physical, psychological and social recovery and rehabilitation.

Meghan told the audience: Itaposs very nice to be back. Itaposs the third year Iaposve had the incredible fortune of joining my husband here. Itaposs just the most inspiring space. When we were watching the videosall the way in Canada we had the same moment of aposhow are you going to choose apos  Well, weaposve done our best. She presented the aposcelebrating excellenceapos award to Lee Spencer, a rower who serves with the Royal Marines for  years and lost his leg helping with a traffic accident. The annual awards, now in their fourth year, brings together hundreds of wounded, injured and sick serving personnel and veterans as well as their families, friends and supporters of the military community. At a reception with backers, nominees and their families, Harry and Meghan chatted to Lee Spenceraposs we Claire Spencer. The -year-old complimented Meghan on how amazing she looked given that she had just had a baby.  She said afterward: She said ‘oh yes, well he is ten months now and is into everythingapos. Asked what she thought of Harry’s decision to step back as a working royal, she said: I think he does an amazing job, as does she, and we should just let them live the le they want to live. I know what a dference Endeavour has made to my husband’s le since he lost a leg and I hold Harry personally responsible for that. Le is too short. The awards ceremony was hosted by former Invictus Games medallist JJ Chalmers and will see four prizes awarded on the night: Recognising Achievement Award, Celebrating Excellence Award, Henry Worsley Award and The Community Impact Award, a new award for this year. Meghan presented the Celebrating Excellence Award and Harry the Henry Worsley Award, to the inidual who has best inspired others through the demonstration of determination in the face of adversity.

We know that there are a number of people who witnessed the incident outside John Lewis in Kingston on the early hours on Saturday morning. I am urging anyone who has any information or mobile phone footage to come forward so we can identy those who committed this horrendous attack. Sally Benatar, the Metaposs South West Commander, said: “This is a senseless and tragic loss of a young le and my thoughts are with Archie’s family and friends at this very sad time.

A landmark study published by the University of Michigan found that colds cost the US economy about  billion annually. This is due to the costs associated with visits to the doctor and lost productivity. The same  study also found that colds account for nearly  million missed school days. However, finding a cure is dficult for a number of reasons. There are  dferent strains of rhinovirus - a type of virus which accounts for about  per cent of colds - which makes it hard to find an effective treatment which would cover them all. Rhinoviruses are also highly prone to mutation. This means that evena treatment were effective to begin with, its shelf le could be limited by the virus developing resistance. And finally, it is believed that evena drug that works were found, unless it has zero side effects, it wonapost be profitable. Experts say that as most people will recover fully from a cold within a week or two, they are unlikely to use a drug which comes with side effects which could potentially be more unpleasant. aposProject Gesundheitapos is believed to sit under Amazonaposs elusive research and development group known as Grand Challenge.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/51777312-cc3a-47bd-a182-d224ea614e8a-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/51777312-cc3a-47bd-a182-d224ea614e8a-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/51777312-cc3a-47bd-a182-d224ea614e8a-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/51777312-cc3a-47bd-a182-d224ea614e8a-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"fintry resident left appalled by councils slow reaction to uncollected bins","story":"Bins in Fintry were left overflowing for five days and led to rubbish lying all over the street – despite council officers promising to have them emptied.Finlaggan Place had bags of waste lying around the pavements earlier this week, after council refuse collectors failed to empty the bins on the right day.It comes less than a week after the city council announced proposals starting next year to change bin collections from once every two weeks to once every three in the upcoming budget.The receptacles were due to be collected on Thursday but it was not until the following Tuesday that the street was finally relieved of the masses of rubbish.Simon Redmond, a resident of the street and treasurer of Fintry Community Council, claims the service from refuse collectors was #not good enough.#Mr Redmond said: #Our bin collection was due to be picked up as normal on Thursday however the collection failed to materialise.#I phoned the council and asked for an explanation but didn’t receive one and was told it would be collected by Friday.#Five days later they still hadn’t been emptied and really it’s not good enough when rubbish is being blown all over the street and bin bags all wrapped at the side of the bins for birds and other animals as there is nowhere for anyone to put their waste.#People had filled the bins thinking that they were going to be emptied and they weren’t, which meant folk had to start putting the bin bags on the ground next to the bins which then attracted animals.#The failed collection comes in the wake of the new council budget proposals which, as well as decreasing the amount of bin collections, would also include an increase on council tax of almost %.There are fears, due to the reduced amount of rubbish pick-ups, large amounts of waste could end up piled on the street.The planned changes,approved, will be introduced during the - financial year.Mr Redmond said: #I’m quite annoyed and disgusted about the change to the bin service.#I’m paying council tax and deserve better service.

We’ve not been beaten in the last few games but it’s important to turn the draws into wins.“We created a number of chances against Alloa on Tuesday night.

I thought: ‘It’s going to be really hard to get in the team in the first place,’ but, luckily enough, I was there within a game.“It’s important as a team that we stick together now and try to get as many points on the board as we can between now and the end of the season.”The consistency of James McPake’s recent team selections has translated into improved – and further improving – performances.The -- system employed by the Dee boss since the - draw away to Greenock Morton in early February seems to suit his players.For Elliott, that tactical comfort is a huge positive.“Everyone on the pitch knows their role,” he said.“Defensively, everybody knows what they need to be doing. We defend as a team. But we’ve also created a number of chances in each and every game I’ve played.“It’s important now that we keep going and keep building on the positives we’re taking from each game.“If you get a few wins together you never know how far you can push your way up.”A pair of wins in the next four days against Ayr would be a big ask but it would do the Dee cause the world of good.They would probably settle for four points.But you won’t catch anyone at Dens admitting it.“These games are massive,” said Elliott.“You look at other teams within the league, below you, and they still have an opportunity to finish in the play-offs, so it’s vital we keep picking up wins. But there’s confidence in the dressing-room. In all the games I’ve played, we’ve created loads of chances.“It’s important we keep doing that, keep doing the other things we’re good at, and get three points on the board whenever we can.”Come the end of the campaign, Dundee will have the option to extend Elliott’s stay at Dens.Whatever happens between now and the end of the season, that’s something the -year-old hopes they take up.“I just want to play games and do well for the club. If they like me, the ball’s in their court,” he said.“But as I said, I’ve enjoyed my time since I’ve been here.

The previous season Main had run riot in scoring twice for Well to beat Aberdeen - in the Scottish Cup semi-final at Hampden in April .Main suffered a frustrating start to his Pittodrie career, due partly to the form of -goal striker Cosgrove.Now Lewis reckons he has rediscovered the form that terrorised the Dons at the national stadium.The keeper said: “We have a bit more to our attacking game at the moment.“It’s the player I remember playing against us when he was at Motherwell.“I didn’t look forward to facing him then and I know the centre-halves didn’t either.“He really does give the opposition a real handful.”January signing Matty Kennedy, secured for £, from St Johnstone until summer , will also be pivotal tomorrow.Kennedy supplied the cross that led to Connor McLennan’s equaliser against Kilmarnock on Wednesday.Lewis said: “Matty has been dferent class since he’s come into the club.“His attitude off the pitch is the same as it is on the pitch. It’s positive.“He’s a likeable lad and has been really good for us.”For the second time in less than a month Aberdeen fought back from behind at Rugby Park to salvage a result. Last month they hit two late goals in the final minute of extra-time to defeat Kilmarnock - in the Scottish Cup fth-round replay.Lewis said: “We were disappointed with the goals we lost, but again we showed character to come back from it.“We saw it before at Rugby Park and I thought we’d kick on and win the game at -. But both teams had chances.“We couldn’t find that final piece. We went there to win the game, but being two goals down, we cannot be too disappointed.”There was understandable frustration within the Aberdeen camp at the opening goal at Kilmarnock.Referee Alan Newlands awarded a penalty for hand-ball by Ash Taylor.However, the centre-back turned his back to the shot with his arms tight by his body. The ball struck his back.Lewis said: “It was two poor goals lost, although I think Ash had his arms by his side at the penalty.“I watched it again and he’s turned with his arm in. It wasn’t up in the air. It hit his arm, but I don’t know where  he could put it and that was harsh on him.”Although beaten twice at Rugby Park the -year-old keeper made a number of vital saves.He produced a superb one-handed ing stop to tip a Stephen O’Donnell volley over the bar.Lewis said: “I was pleased with the save from Stephen O’Donnell.“I was pleased to make some saves and play a part in winning a point.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions.

We also take a look at what farming is doing to tackle climate change – the issue of the decade.#We were delighted to work alongside NFUS to produce these episodes of OnFARM. Podcasting is a superb way to get key messages across in a way that is enjoyable to listen to and yet informative at the same time.

The glass came well back. At a quarter to eight we heard a poor weather forecast with gales and rain for practically every area including north-easters for both Malin and Hebrides. In the news that followed we heard that Moyanawas in trouble on her way home and was asking for help as she would have to be abandoned.As there was no hurry about moving as we meant to wait for the flood and there was obviously little enjoyment to be had on deck we turned over and went to sleep again. We hoped to make Tobermory in the late afternoon having the flood with us all the way andthings got no worse.At half past nine we began to turn out. A cold strong north-westerly was blowing but it was dry. Seewolf had sailed for Oban but Lindisfarne was still with us with Guy still shoutingand singing with undiminished enthusiasm. The Saguenay was not happy – a man was crouching in her cockpit with the lead line in his hand keeping watch for the first sign of dragging.We had a breakfast of grapefruitand bacon and eggs. One of the eggs when broken into a cup was so rotten it nearly blew the Pilot out of the forecastle.After our meal we had a big clean up above and below and the Tar pumped the ship then, with the wind falling light, the rain started again and blankets etc. up on deck to air had to come down in a hurry, but the glass was beginning to show signs of being somewhere near the bottom for the time being.The Tanky and Tar took shelter in the dog-house with the Major and talked of this and that while the rest of us occupied ourselves below. The Bosun and Pilot finished putting the tacklines in the flags, the former got a book while the latter started sketching. The Skipper had a patent lighter that could be used in any weather no matter how blowy or how wet, but which, when working emitted a series of sparks and this was the subject of one of the sketches. The Mate fitted up a tumbler holder in the ladies cabin then did some knitting, the Skipper, after cutting the tacklines to the requiredhad a snooze.At two o’clock by which time it was calm and raining less heavily, the Tanky and Mate started getting our dinner of lamb salad, greengages and custard, coffee and Yo-Yo biscuits, ready and the Pilot and Skipper tried mixing gin and Dubonnet but decided that to do so merely spoilt good gin. The Tanky, however, seemed to enjoy Dubonnet by itself and she was given the freedom of the bottle. About this time the man in the Saguenay got tired of holding his lead line and he shted billet to inshore from us.When we started lunch it was almost a flat calm, but coming on deck after it ready to go onto Tobermory, we found the wind had risen considerably and had veered a point. We got our anchor at four o’clock and under engine went out into the Sound of Mull and, turning west, began to get up our sails as we passed the Morven Pier.In view of the forecast and of what we could see ahead of us we decided to tie down two reefs. We got the tack and clew lashed down and had started on the reef points when we began to doubt the wisdom of proceeding. The wind was fresh and getting stronger every minute and the sea was increasing similarly – to go on would mean getting a proper hammering and the prospect of a north-east gale would mean our intended anchorage in Tobermory would probably be most uncomfortable .The decision of whether to turn back or not was left to the Skipper for as usual, on these occasions, the Pilot steadfastly refused to offer any opinion, but he did agree that the Skipper was right when he decided on the former course. Round we came, the jib was broken out, and we scampered back to Loch Aline. At the narrows the jib was furled and under engine only we ran up to Kinlochaline and let go off the boat-house at ten past five. The Mate, Tanky, and Tar, down below and unaware of our change of plan were quite bewildered when they heard the chain run out and the first named came on deck to find out where we had got to.The Saguenay had preceded us to this anchorage and the Lindisfarne came up a little later and Guy said that Kyle Bay, in the rapidly rising gale, was getting almost untenable. In Kinlochaline we were very comfortable though, even here there was quite a lop on the water and we were sheering about a good deal in the squalls. It was raining very heavily but the Bosun took the Major ashore, but still without any concrete results.At six we had a cup of tea with cake and biscuits and by the time this was finished it was blowing a full gale. The weather forecast was bad and our only consolation was that it was ever so much worse for the South.In the Channel the barometer had reached a record low level for July and force  and  winds were commonly reported all over England and Wales. With us the glass had turned and was . up since mid-day. Then with the exceptions of the Bosun who was in the dog-house and the Tar who played patience we spent the next hour or so dosing in the cabin.At half past eight we had a supper of scrambled eggs and meat roll for those that wanted it, then we put up the tents and down the angel and veered a further five fathoms of chain, making it twenty out in three fathoms of water.We could see out in the Sound of Mull that a huge sea was running and down by the narrows the top of the water was being swept off in spindrt. The squalls where we were were very fierce but, there being no sea, we were lying quite comfortably and never once put a pull on the anchor though we did suffer rather badly from bobstayitis.Two motor boats came up for shelter. One, Ormidale, anchored off the west shore opposite us, but the otherlet go out in the middle of the loch and kept steaming to her anchor for as long as we could see her.It was a wild night and at eleven o’clock to cheer himself up the Bosun made coffee for himself and the Pilot and half a cupful for the Tanky. While they were having it the rest of us started to turn in.That gale was news and in our sheltered corner we had no idea how bad it was. Even in Crinan warps were carried away and yachts set adrt in the basin. All round the coast were reports of vessels in distress one, a steamer in the Channel, being rolled right over.Next week:"},{"url":null,"title":"pedal power at macpool","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt was with trepidation I arrived at Mid Argyll Community Poolahead of the aqua bike try-out session [writes Rachel Carruthers].Exercise classes and I don#t often seem like a natural fit but I was excited to give the new craze a go.Aqua cycling uses stationary bikes immersed in a swimming pool, with water up to participants# waists, making it a non-weight bearing exercise.Aqua bikes can be used at all abilities and are often used in high intensity classes, giving a vigorous cardiovascular workout in a low impact environment # an ideal way to reduce obesity and prevent ill health.Stationary cycling and water-based exercises are also frequently recommended for patients suffering with osteoarthritis or recovering from knee and hip surgery or injury, therefore combining both is an obvious step.MACPool successfully applied for funding through the Argyll and Bute HSCP Self Management Fund to run the All Ability Cycling Project in partnership with Cycling UK and the Ardrishaig Bothy. As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

American.And although some may only know the titular song, Anything Goes, audiences are bound to fall in love with the equally tuneful I Get a Kick Out of You and Blow, Gabriel, Blow.If the classic showtunes werent enough to whet your theatre appetite, the amazing cast of this production will certainly capture your attention.Donning the flapper style, each cast member brings their own flair to their roles.Anything Goes star-crossed lovers, Hope Harcourt and Billy Crocker, played by Catriona Lamb and Jack McAuley show that even when apart, their characters determination to be together couldnt be stopped by those who would stand in their way. Catriona, although only -years-old, seems mature beyond her years, taking the lead role in her stride, proving to be every inch the sophisticated s New Yorker.And Jacks lead role as Billy is perfectly paired with his unlikely partner, found in Dan Wilsons portrayal of Public Enemy , Moonface Martin. The duo first meet when stowing themselves away on the cruise liner, and their hare-brained schemes get them into some serious trouble, but also provides plenty of entertainment.A notable performance comes from Holly Nichol, who makes her GAOS principal role debut as the feisty and sassy nightclub singer, Reno Sweeney. Hollys passion for musical theatre is clear in her performance. Reno is a pivotal role, featuring in many musical numbers, and Holly doesnt miss a beat.A heavy dose of comedy is packed into this performance, whether drunk Eli Whitney, played by Simon Thomson, slurring around the ship, trying his hardest to woo the high-strung Mrs Harcourt, or the bumbling idiot, Lord Evelyn Oakleigh, who manages to make a mess of even the simplest of New York sayings.The audience will double over in laughter as James Bennetts performance of the incredibly posh Evelyn raises eyebrows, and Excalibur, when he sees Reno in her nightgown.As well as their top talent as actors and singers, this productions cast show they also have what it takes in the dancing department too. From the high kicks in the opening number, I Get a Kick Out of You, to the tap dancing break in the Act One finale performance of Anything Goes, members of the audience will be transfixed.Congratulations must go to musical director Jeff Thomson for creating a remarkable show.CAST LISTBilly Crocker - Jack McAuleyHope Harcourt - Catriona LambReno Sweeney - Holly NicholMoonface Martin - Dan WilsonErma - Jess ThomsonEvelyn Oakleigh - James BennettEvangeline Harcourt - Lorraine KempElisha J.

Then, from left back, Pupils’ captain Keith Mitchell wove a path between several Parkhall defenders and was unlucky to see his effort erted wide by the hosts’ keeper, amidst mounting pressure from the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils.Disappointingly, though, the visitors conceded a goal from a simple throw-in routine which undid their good work in the previous half hour, Parkhall midfielder Dougherty running off his marker and unleashing a sweet strike beyond Lamont to put Parkhall in front.Minutes later, Lamont, who was between the sticks for the team’s consecutive league titles in  and , then pulled off a wonder save to deny Parkhall a second.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils then produced another attacking spell of their own before the half-time whistle, with Liam Renton having two efforts on goal tipped round the post in the space of a minute by the Parkhall keeper.From the second save, the Pupils made the most of the resultant corner kick, when Renton delivered a swerving ball which found right winger Scott Souden, who guided a firm downward header into the Parkhall net to make it -.Into the second half, the Pupils had to weather a storm from their hosts, but found composure again and began to create excellent chances for themselves. Renton went close again from a free kick  yards out, but was denied by another fingertip save from Parkhall’s impressive keeper.Scott Souden had a chance to put the Pupils in front, after being put through on goal by a cutting through pass from Ryan Deans, but a loose touch gave the home keeper a chance to make a ing save and ert the ball wide.Then, the Pupils were pegged back for the second time when a corner from the hosts’ left-hand side was side-footed home by Parkhall’s Cannin, beyond Lamont’s clutches.Pushing hard for another equaliser, the Pupils had a lot of the play around Parkhall’s penalty area, and Donald McCallum, introduced as a substitute, pounced on a loose ball in the box from a Pupils free-kick but saw his effort blocked in the six-yard box.Into injury time, Parkhall, who had defended their lead resolutely in the closing stages, broke forward against the tide of Pupils pressure and made it - through striker Kevin Williams, who tucked a low effort into the Pupils’ net.The Pupils must now regroup for more league action tomorrowwith the visit of Neilston AFC.

Edinburgh University, astonishingly, failed to support her.The gay tennis icon Martina Navratilova was expelled from the LGBT group, Athlete Ally, for saying that people with male physiques should not complete in womenrsquos sport.Cultural and health bodies, and even the Scottish Government, were ceasing to use the very word ldquowoman in case it offended male-bodied transwomen. Bizarre substitutes like ldquowomxn, ldquomenstruators and ldquociswomen were being deployed in the cause of inclusivity.Well, times change. This issue is now out in the open. More and more women are speaking out against the undermining of sex-based rights.Even the ultra-wokeis permitting columns from feminists like Suzanne Moore calling for an end to the ldquono ing of gender-critical academics like Professor Selina Todd and Dr Kathleen Stock. They have been labelled as ldquoTerfs by trans zealots.Last week, the UK Government called a halt to self-identication legislation south of the Border. Ministers discovered that children as young as  are being given puberty blockers by gender reassignment clinics. Puberty blockers halt the sexual development of children. They are of the class of drugs once used as chemical castration for sex offenders.Influential figures in the SNP, like the former communications guru, Kevin Pringle, are now urging Nicola Sturgeon to follow the UK Government. But the Scottish Equalities Secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, apparently intends to press ahead with legislation to allow self-ID. Mr Pringle is speaking for many in the party who now realise that the growing backlash against Self-ID could threaten the SNPrsquos chances in next yearrsquos Holyrood elections.Yet it seemed glaringly obvious to me two years ago that women would never accept this existential assault on their sexual identity. How could they be expected to accept people with male genitalia and masculine physiques as real women  Why should women be forced to accept male-bodied transwomen in their protected spaces, in changing rooms and toilets Indeed, at first I thought this proposition that transwomen were literally women was just anti-trans scaremongering. Surely activists werenrsquot actually saying that they were biologically female I learned the hard way that this is precisely what they were saying. I was repeatedly accused of hate speech for suggesting that this would mean the removal of human biology from the school curriculum.Political leaders like Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens and the former leader of the Liberal Democrats Jo Swinson continue to insist that people with penises can be and are actually female. Labourrsquos Shadow Equalities Secretary, Dawn Butler, said last month that ldquobabies are born without a sex. This is pure flat earthism.Shamefully, leading feminists like Germaine Greer have been ldquocancelled for objecting to extreme transgenderism as misogyny. That it demeans and invalidates women.How could someone with a male body possibly experience social reality in the way real women do  Transwomen do not have uteruses, do not menstruate, do not give birth.Trans advocates reply that, well, some women canrsquot give birth and some women donrsquot menstruate. This is ridiculous and offensive sophistry. Asa woman ceases to be a womanshe canrsquot have children.These canards are still re on social media with people arguing that clown fish changing sex, and people born intersex ldquoprovethat there is no fixed biological definition of sex.Humans are of course mammals, not fish. The existence of a minuscule number of people born intersexdoesnrsquot alter the fact that . per cent of humans are born male or female.Humans are a binary species. We are not hermaphrodites. Sexual dferentiation is the basis of human reproduction. That this needs to be said is a shocking reflection on the intellectual integrity of the left. Many supposedly sensible people have been morally coerced into accepting something they know to be untrue. It is deeply worrying.Most SNP politicians know that transgender ideology is nonsense. They keep quiet partly because of fear of Britainrsquos onerous hate speech laws.It has been left to genuinely courageous women like Joan McAlpine MSP and Joanna Cherry, MP, to fight for reason. For doing so they have been the target of astonishing abuse on social media, and from the trans activists embedded in the SNP.Academics like Lucy Hunter Blackburn have bravely challenged the proposal to remove the question on sex from the national census.This has nothing to do with ldquotransgender rights. Trans people are free to identy as anyone they wish. No one is stopping them wearing what they want or loving who they wish. This is not homophobia ..In fact, advocates of Self-ID, like Stonewall, have set back the cause of trans rights by harnessing it to a quasi-religious dogma.Mr Pringle and others in the SNP now realise that the Scottish Government is marching into a minefield by persevering with Self-ID without proper debate. Given the pause in England, it could lead to a transgender Gretna Green.But there is an equitable solution. Of course allow transwomen to identy as female without needless bureaucratic obstacles. But the Government should make clear in the legislation reforming the Gender Recognition Act that this does not mean abolishing the biological definition of sex or infringing womenrsquos sex-based rights under the Equalities Act.Yoursquod think that a feminist like Nicola Sturgeon would regard that as self-evident. Perhaps she does.

The rest, as they say, is history. Except, in the case of the Tudor dynasty, this is a period thatrsquos never allowed to die. And in Henryrsquos case, as everyone knows, Anne Boleyn was only the second bite on his kebab.The publication of the final part of Hilary Mantelrsquos Thomas Cromwell trilogy, The Mirror  the Light, has been treated asitrsquos breaking news. The antics of the rapacious Henry VIII and his Machiavellian chief minister took place nearly  years ago, yet the airwaves, review and feature pages, and even fashion spreads are dominated by talk of the Tudors. Whether itrsquos their backstabbing ambition, headbands and bodices, or iron-fisted bureaucracy, weto them again and again, like birds to a hollow coconut shell, hoping for another flake.Mantelrsquos work is as thorough and intense an exploration of the political mind as yoursquoll find. That the previous two books in the series won the Booker Prize indicates their artistic merit as well as their accuracy. Those who donrsquot feel Cromwell merits so many pages might be surprised to find themselves hooked. And, although the factual detail is so well-founded the trilogy could become set texts for students, this is the past recast by the authorrsquos imagination. Official, dispassionate, unspun history it is not.Mantelrsquos portrayal of Henryrsquos sleekit, ruthless, tight-lipped consigliere has parallels with people in power today. Those echoes, and the entanglements of a murderous but exquisitely dressed court, are where the perennial fascination with Henryrsquos entourage lies. That his time on the throne was soon to be followed by Elizabeth Irsquos long tenure has ensured that,this era is to your taste, therersquos enough to chew on for a letime. Yet dramatic and richly brocaded as all this is, havenrsquot we now had enough  Isnrsquot it time to look where, and bid the Tudors farewell Historical fiction sounds like a timeless niche, untroubled by tides of fashion. As Mantelrsquos supremacy shows, however, it is as susceptible to fads as everything . There was a time when the Tudors were considered dusty and tired. Mention of Henryrsquos six wives or the Spanish Armada conjured up Jean Plaidy and school lessons: interestingthat was your kind of thing, but hardly thrilling or new.Writers in this genre are in a tricky situation. Publishers want them to be original yet follow the road more travelled, to mine a popular seam but make it their own. If nothing , Mantelrsquos oeuvre is a masterclass in how to go about this. Yet some years ago, before her meteoric rise, it seemed the appetite for Tudor was waning. The German market, a literary agent told me, had overdosed and lost interest in buying the rights to anything further from this era. Then Mantel rekindled the flame to such an extent that today, from Hamburg to Heidelberg, she will be in bookshop windows, kept company on the shelves by best-selling Alison Weir and Philippa Gregory, both of whom have also made Hampton Court their second home.And, just as the pitiless English royals in farthingales and ruffs are enjoying their moment in the sun, so too is anything set during the two world wars, or in Victoriarsquos later years. Like children who ask for the same story every bedtime, it seems that readers love nothing better than retreading old ground before they douse the lights.Most genre novels are looked down on by the literati as second class citizens. That is why Mantelrsquos Booker victories offered such encouragement for others ploughing a similar furrow. Yet having written historical fiction myself, set in the early th-century Borders, I have reservations: not about the calibre or worth of the genre, but about how it ranks with fiction that comes almost entirely from the writerrsquos imagination.As Andrew Marr said of The Mirror  the Light, the ending is never in doubt. The same goes for aspects of all books in which real-le figures play a part. When it comes to plotting, these fixed points become the beads on the rosary between which the narrative is threaded. They might cause problems when interweaving made-up with documented events, but they provide an off-the-peg outline around which to build a story. Writers portraying modern le through invented characters do not have this luxury. All they can rely upon are their powers of invention and the quality of their prose. To my mind, despite the spadework needed when researching previous centuries, that is a much harder act to pull off.With the Tudors dominating the bestseller lists, what astonishes me most is how little of our history fiction has yet covered. In this country alone there is material for libraries of new novels set in the centuries before the Stewarts claimed the throne, and long after the Jacobites retreated to their peaty hovels. The past might well be a foreign country, as L P Hartley wrote, but some areas seem to attract package holiday tours, leaving tumbleweed to roll through the rest."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-pandemic-clear-bed-blocking-people-taken-system","story":"Professor June Andrews recognised hercomments were ldquohorric but gave an honest assessmentof the potential consequences of a large-scale coronavirus outbreak.Prof Andrews is a former director of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Centre for Change and Innovation.

Amongst his many wilful misinterpretations, his reference to ldquohellipattempts to break up Canadarsquos -year-old unionhellip is particularly revealing. The UK is a union Canada is a Confederation. Canadians routinely refer to their ldquofederal government. The federal nature of its governance is what has kept this geographically, linguistically and culturally erse country together.The two referendums on Quebec independence reinforced this federalism and changed the whole country. And even that may not be enough to save the confederation, whose fate still hangs in the balance. By contrast, there is not, and never has been, anything remotely federal about UK governance. The UK is the most centralised of all the democracies. It is as far from any kind of Canadian federalism as is possible. The idea that it would ever embrace such federalism is disingenuous nonsense.

We round them up isolate and detain them and then pack them off to their country of origin using some minor refraction real or imagined.Those we give leave to remain must first be doused in the healing waters of a UK history exam which conveniently omits to mention any of those gnarly deeds of empire which caused them ultimately to seek peace here. We havenrsquot yet got round to forcing them to wear bells around their necks and shout ldquoUnclean! Unclean! but the Toriesrsquo Windrush project was a close approximation.We ascribe to them, in the manner of a pandemic, all sorts of anti-social behaviours and deploy our Conservative-leaning newspapers to de-humanise them and portray them as a danger to the British way of le. Only after we consider them safe and have absorbed them safely into the UK bloodstream do we permit a limited number ndash at a distance ndash to share in this nationrsquos bounty, much of which is built on what we looted from their countries in the first place.The instinct towards the survival of the fittest, which lies at the heart of Tory doctrine, comes to the fore when a global pandemic begins to rattle. In , the prestigious US think-tank Brookings studied how poor countries and disadvantaged communities suffer disproportionately when pandemics roar. ldquoRegardless of where a pandemic starts, once underway, the poor tend to bear the brunt. Low and middle-income countries have weaker health systems and limited capacity to handle surges in cases.The essay went on: ldquoWe can curtail pandemicswe quickly develop vaccines and make them widely accessible. However, without vigorous efforts to secure equitable access, vaccine distribution will follow the logic of the market. During the  swine flu pandemic, wealthy countries secured large advance orders for vaccines, but, despite the efforts of the World Health Organisation to negotiate donations, poor countries were crowded out ndash receiving vaccines more slowly than rich countries and unable to cover as many of their citizens.At its most primitive level this tendency is evident in bulk-buying at supermarkets or filling up at petrol stations during an energy shortage.

Launched by the association in , it is now reaching a crescendo as young players mature and act as inspirational role models for a new generation.Meanwhile, recent local authority cuts to music tuition has caused concern among parents, but there has been an unexpected spin-off for the SBBA, with rising numbers said to be turning to community brass bands to provide musical education and, in some cases, even to help children with asthma improve their lung capacity.ldquoWith the cuts in funding for brass tuition in schools, young musicians are a particular area of focus for SBBA and a pound, grant from the YMI scheme is helping to make a real dference, adds Ms Boax.As a result, youth participation in the Scottish brass band movement is now at an all-time high, with more than  new youth bands currently up and running ndash bringing the number of youth bands across the country to .Of the , people in the associationrsquos member bands,  per cent are under  years old.At the same time, the traditional image of the all-male brass band made up of miners and factory workers has been shed.In a mirror image of the  British film Brassed Off, which saw a young female flugelhorn player, played by Tara Fitzgerald, battle to join an all-male band, women and girls now make up almost half of the SBBA bandsrsquo members.Itrsquos an impressive turnaround in fortunes for a movement that at one point seemed set to struggle as the collieries, paper and textile mills, foundries and factories that many bands were historically linked to faded and closed.The craze for brass bands emerged in the early th century. But while English bands tended to be linked to churches, Scottish Presbyterian churchesrsquo preference for unaccompanied Psalms meant early brass bands in Scotland tended to be linked to the military.The industrial revolution, however, saw an explosion in brass bands across the country, with groups of workers encouraged by pit owners and factory bosses to form bands rather than spend their time drinking in the pub.In some cases, landowners formed their own bands: the Marquis of Lothianrsquos Band is thought to date from the s.Others, including Langholm, St Ronanrsquos Barrhead, Peebles and Penicuik, are among Scotlandrsquos oldest and are still thriving."},{"url":null,"title":"300-000-revamp-arbroath-abbey","story":"Now Historic Environment Scotland has announced a pound, investment at Arbroath Abbey to mark the anniversary of Scotlandrsquos most famous document.The Declaration Of Arbroath, originally known as the Baronsrsquo Letter, was drafted in medieval Latin in the scriptorium of Arbroath Abbey, in .Sealed by  magnates and nobles, it was sent to Pope John XXII to assert Scotlandrsquos status as an independent kingdom and ask the Pope to recognise Robert The Bruce as the lawful King of Scotland.HES said the investment would ldquoenhance the visitor offer at the historic landmark, which draws more than , people each year.The visitor centre, closed for refurbishment since October , will reopen on April  -- the th anniversary of the Declaration -- with an exhibition exploring the history of the Abbey from its founding in  to the present day.A facsimile of the Declaration has been gted to the abbey by the National Records of Scotland , keepers of the priceless original sheepskin parchment.Almost indistinguishable from the -year-old original, the facsimile has been replicated by internationally renowned conservator and restorer David Frank, using the same methods and materials.The ldquoArbroath Tapestryndash a hand-stitched artwork tells the story of the Declaration through a triptych of intricately sewn  ndash will also be unveiled.Other highlights include medieval artacts that relate to the site, including arrowheads from the Wars of Independence era, a royal tombstone and a book that records  years of events at the Abbey a new digital model of the Abbey as it once was and an on-screen resource about the barons who supported the sending of the Declaration.Alex Paterson, chief executive of HES, said: ldquoWe are delighted to be providing this new investment in the Arbroath Abbey visitor experience as part of the wider commemorations for the th year anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath.

This is the best day weve had, I hope they come back again.\"Those with a visual impairment found the ponies to be really interactive, and because they were quite big they were easier to see than other smaller therapy pets.While the young service users and their families are usually dealing with sensory impairment from birth, the older group are generally learning to cope with age-related sight and or hearing loss.Both groups experience challenges which, without support, may result in low mood, loss of confidence and social isolation.Sharing this Joyful Ponies visit enabled these erse age groups to communicate, compare experiences and learn from each other, while benefiting from the mood-enhancing and confidence-building session.Sadly, the ponies couldnt stay for tea but the young and elderly group members had a great time talking about their experience over refreshments after the visit.For more information about NESS visit www.nesensoryservices.org.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Judges James Taylor , Ronnie Kelmanand Caroline de Rouffignac \"  , Ronnie Kelmanand Caroline de Rouffignac \"  North East Scotland Food  Drink Awards finalists revealed viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"top tesla prize for petrolhead","story":"A self-confessed petrolhead from Insch is making the switch to a top of the range electric car after winning a Tesla Model  Performance worth #, thanks to dream car competition, BOTB.Contest winner Mike Lynch, who also bagged £, in cash, admitted he played for the Tesla in a bid to be more “environmentally conscious” after switching to an electric car in the last few months.He was surprised with his win over the phone by BOTB presenter Christian Williams on Monday, February  before being flown down to Windsor, Surrey, where he was put up in a -star hotel.Mike was shown his prize Tesla the following day.Up until recently Mike had been driving a Range Rover V, however in a bid to be more green recently switched to the BMW is electric car because Tesla was too far out of his price range.Commenting on the new motor Mike said: This is an incredible car.“Its performance matches that of most sports cars and it’s stacked with gadgets - and I’m a real gadget man.”Mike works for an automation engineer for an oil company, developing solutions to help the company reduce its carbon footprint. “I work in reducing how much fuel we are using, so having won an electric car is quite fitting in that respect,” he said. “The way I see it is we’ll all be driving around in electric cars soon enough, so it’s good to get one and get used to it - but this will be in style.”Having first owned an off road motorbike at the age of seven, Mike has been hooked on all things motoring and motorsport ever since, going to watch the British Grand Prix at Silverstone on numerous occasions with his dad Allan. “The first thing I’ll do when I get the Tesla is drive it down to my parents in Edinburgh,” he added. “There’s no way I’d have been able to take the is as the charge wouldn’t last the journey, but the new Tesla will.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Coronavirus testing in a laboratory.

They asserted that it went against current council policy, which dictates that there should be no permanent increases to the current officer establishment.At the end of discussions, the council leader received more support, and councillor Stockan’s motion won,  votes to seven.However, at a general meeting of the council yesterday, Tuesday, the council leader agreed that the issue should be referred back to the policy and resources committee, following a further call by Councillor Tullock.Councillor Tullock said that he made his amendment in light of the failure of Scottish Government to provide a budget settlement to OIC, plus the concerns expressed to him by his constituents on the issue.Councillor Stockan said that he himself had received support for the establishment of the post, but he was happy to have it taken back to committee.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If Singapore — a city-state with no rural areas — is the economic model for those who inform this Government’s thinking then it speaks volumes about their priorities. This London-focused vision of the United Kingdom risks undermining the future of farmers, crofters and fishermen – and the communities that rely on them.“These views seem to be expressed at the heart of Government decision-making, and the pattern is all too similar to when the UK joined the Common Fisheries Policy. The Tory Government at the time claimed it would protect UK fishermen while privately dismissing them as “expendable”.He continued: “The Government must remember that the United Kingdom is far more than simply London or London’s financial sector. We should embrace and enhance the geographic and economic ersity of the United Kingdom, not toss it away in the name of a single-minded metropolitan view.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The organisation is now missed very much. It was an independent local organisation for the people of Orkney.#Ms Taylor, along with former colleagues and supporters, feels that there is now a big void in community mental health services. They are interested in hearing thoughts, views and ideas regarding a proposed new venture called Orkney Open Door Counselling, with the eventual aim being to source funding and sponsorship for the running of a service and its premises.The closure of OACAS, which was announced shortly before Christmas, has caused a great deal of upset in the community, with several clients and former staff members sharing their concerns with The Orcadian. The service#s former chairwoman, Chloe Jowett, has said that #years of underfunding# and a history of #undervaluing# community mental health services in Orkney was behind its abrupt and unwelcome demise.All are welcome at the public meeting, due to be held at St Magnus Centre, Kirkwall, on Saturday, March  at pm.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It suggests that agreement is possible on how the newer vessels that our internal ferry services so desperately need might be funded.“Fuel and maintenance costs continue to rise steeply, while the disruption caused by the removal of MV Eynhallow from service illustrates perfectly the urgency of putting in place vessels that are fit for purpose.“The Transport Minister has acknowledged again that Orkney’s internal ferry services fall well below the minimum standards set out in the government’s own National Ferries Plan. He also insists that discussions with the Council to find a long term solution to the delivery of these leline services are ‘ongoing’.“Meantime, however, the communities in Orkney most directly affected are growing increasingly frustrated at the lack of visible progress.

But there’s also something for adults, with the Freaky Sequin Cabaret and the madness of the Old Time Sailors raucous flashmob concerts.Keeping to the sea theme, there will be two talks telling tales of the high seas — one on a canoeing trip around the UK and the other a near-death experience on the Round the World yacht race.“This year we’re trying to take events out across the islands and to introduce audiences to experiences in new venues,” said Alasdair.“So we’ll see a horn quartet in the kitchen of Noltland Castle on Westray and talks about le on the high seas in Highland Park Distillery.”The festival ends with a silent film, accompanied by a live performance of newly created music.Orkney’s midsummer St Magnus International Festival marks the start of the summer’s festivals in Scotland and each year brings large numbers to the islands, boosting the economy and revealing Orkney to the wider world.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Some passengers on that trip stayed aboard for the current voyage.ldquoThe ship will not come on shore until we appropriately assess the passengers, Calornia Governor Gavin Newsom said on Thursday.Another Princess cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined for two weeks in Yokohama, Japan, last month because of the virus, and ultimately about  of the , people aboard became infected in what experts pronounced a public health failure, with the vessel essentially becoming a floating germ factory.copy -.

The route had been changed because of severe weather over the previous week, making for a course that was very heavy underfoot and flooded in several places.Todd managed to get to the front of the queue at the line and set off at a steady pace, settling in to a position within the top  or so runners after the initial surge.Over the next  minutes she maintained her form and starting easing her way up through the field to settle in sixth place as the runner approached the final quarter of the race.As the finish was coming into sight, Todd started to kick for home and her efforts were rewarded as she moved up to fourth and battled all the way to the finish line to maintain that position, getting it on the line with no more than a foot’sfrom the athlete in fth place.Coach David Wagstaff said it was a fantastic achievement for the youngster, who was not only a great prospect for the future in athletics but also an aspiring triathlete who was doing well on the junior circuit.Todd and her parents thanked NorthLink Ferries, without whose generous sponsorship participation in the cross country championships would not have been possible..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 27 ","story":"With the Six Nations Rugby Championship now three-fths of the way through, only France remain unbeaten.Scotland’s victory over Italy in Rome on Saturday was deserved, and enough to avoid the ignominy of the wooden spoon.As a spectacle the match will not live long in the memory, save for captain Stuart Hogg scoring the kind of try that only a few in the world can produce.Hogg’s display overall was very good, both defensively and from an attacking point of view. From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”.

Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!.

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row.

It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John. He is a really free and open singer so we can play whatever we want all the time.“I am so excited about the gig in the Empire.

And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in limbo over move","story":"CHAIR of the Riverdale Finaghy Tenants’ Association says he, along with other members, remain in “limbo” over a proposed “take-over” of properties under the ownership ofVictoria Housing Estatesto Choice Housing.Currently a joint consultation is underway between VHE and Choice around proposals to agree a transfer of its stock in Riverdale to the housing body. Chair Joby Fox told the Andersonstown News that at a recent meeting with VHE and Choice, tenants initially thought that on the “face of it, the proposal looked like a good offer”.“But when presented with the details tenants felt angry and left with the threat of their homes being sold on the open market to the highest bidderthey don’t accept the deal. This is clearly a case of duress.“The issue now is that the terms that are being offered for the option to buy our properties or move to Choice Housing do not reflect the time that people have lived in their homes,” explained Joby.“VHE are only offering the properties at current market prices with no offer for commission based on the time we have resided in our homes or indeed no reflection on the severe hardship which we have endured under the watch of VHE and the Charity Commission NI ,” he said. “The biggest majority of our tenants and their families have lived and maintained the houses for over  years”.Joby said that he believes the proposal is “unlikely” to go through.“It would mean that VHE and CCNI put themselves beyond accountability, so we have to ask, who’s agenda is best served by this move  It’s clear that VHE and CCNI want to sweep their five years of failure under the carpet.”Commenting on the ongoing consultation Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey said: “The problems regarding Victoria Housing are well known, I have spoken about these issues with residents and representatives of Victoria Housing both publicly and privately. These issues are of a hugely concerning nature to the tenants of Victoria Housing. We are talking about the core rights of tenants and the condition of their homes.“This is why this consultation is so vitally important and I would ask that every tenant feeds into this consultation because it is the very basis of the future of their homes. Please seek independent advice being offered by the Housing Rights service and by Supporting Communities and exhaust every question you have.“It is up to the residents to shape this consultation and I look forward to the results of the consultation and most importantly hearing solutions to the problems Victoria Housing residents face.”No-one from Victoria Housing Estates was available for comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place. Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to. The suicide rates just keep going up and up every year. Mental health, struggles with mental health, is a sickness, it’s a sickness you can’t see but it’s there. Everybody’s mental health struggles are dferent. With the release of the song, the album, I hope when people hear it it gives them a bit of comfort, to hear that there is always hope”.Alanna will be attending as well as performing on the night of the ball along with fellow artists Joleen Burns, Leah Hawkins and Second Nature.“Invitations have gone out to MPs from across the city to attend and whoever shows up is showing their support for this cause.”Alanna spoke of the pressures facing young people as they prepare to leave school for the next chapter of their lives.“For your entire le you are being looked after by your mummy and daddy and then, all of a sudden, it’s like you need to know what you want to do with your le. A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night. A big ‘ball’ of happiness for everyone on the night.“I’d like to thank Supervalu in the Dairy Farm and ver Photos along with other businesses who helped get the album made and for their support and I’m looking forward to people hearing it.”• The Stand By Me Spring Ball will take place on Friday, March . Tickets are priced at £ which includes a three-course meal and champagne reception. For those not wanting to partake in the meal, £ is payable at the door.

A security source said police officers have been standing guard at the station since early February.The Belfasthas chosen not to identy the location of the station but has observed officers carrying out foot patrols in its vicinity.Officers have also been placed at the station#s main entrances as a precaution.The source revealed that the PSNI fears the possible attack may occur during the daytime in an attempt by dissidents to catch officers off-guard.The source went into detail on how the security services believe the attack would most likely be airborne, and probably an improvised mortar device.The PSNI has declined to respond, stating it does comment on operational matters.The latest incident carried out by dissidents took place last December when a suspected grenade was thrown at a police car in west Belfast.It follows a -month period of increasing activity from dissidents. Last September a bomb - described as being in the advanced state of readiness - was made safe by ammunition technical officers after it was found in the Creggan area of Londonderry.A similar attack took place two days earlier which resulted in the PSNI making safe a mortar bomb that had been left close to a police station in Strabane.Last August dissidents used a hoax device to lure police officers and soldiers to a remote rural location at Wattlebridge near the border in Co Fermanagh and then exploded the real bomb.Chief Constable Simon Byrne later laid the blame on Continuity IRA terrorists for the potentially lethal incident.The previous month dissidents tried to murder police officers during an attack in Craigavon, Co Armagh, with a device discovered on Tullygally Road.In July  the New IRA claimed responsibility for a bomb placed under a police officer#s car at Shandon Park Golf Club in east Belfast.The PSNI later released a statement which placed the blame on violent dissident republicans.The latest PSNI security bulletin has revealed there has been an increase in the number of shooting incidents, bombing incidents and paramilitary-style attacks between March  and last month.It also recorded one security-related death - the murder of journalist Lyra McKee, who was killed by a bullet fired by dissidents during rioting in the Creggan in Derry.Also in March dissidents posted five explosive devices posted to locations across the UK, including one sent to Glasgow UniversityMark Lindsay, chair of the Police Federation of Northern Ireland, said yesterday that while he would not comment on the police station threat, any attempt by dissidents to launch an attack is to be roundly condemned. We need an all-out effort by society to isolate such extremism and help the PSNI bring these people before the courts, he said. Officers are resolute in their determination to serve society and it is intolerable that in  we still have to deal with such threats to our police officers.

In a wide-ranging interview, Mrs Long revealed that relations between the DUP and Sinn Fein in the new Executive are more strained than before because of three years without devolution.But she said there was more open debate and a healthier atmosphere around the table than previously.The Alliance leader said that next week#s Renewable Heat Incentive inquiry report shouldn#t be used as an opportunity for the parties to tear strips off each other and make things more dficult.Rather than a highly personalised response targeting iniduals, the focus should be on reforming the system to ensure that past mistakes are never repeated.Amidst speculation about explosive exchanges with Arlene Foster during the talks to restore devolution, Mrs Long said it was totally untrue to suggest she disliked the DUP leader.I have no trouble looking at the % vote threshold and saying, that#s our next challenge. You have to aim high. There is no ceiling on my ambition for AllianceOn a personal level, I like Arlene and get on well with her, she said. We probably clash because we#re both direct and straight talking sowe disagree on something we go head-to-head, not around each other#s backs.I prefer that approach to politics. I welcome getting to know Arlene better as First Minister around the Executive table. There is no personal animosity at all.Mrs Long said her party had started  hoping to break through the % vote barrier.

There is no ceiling on my ambition for Alliance.I would love us to become the largest party in Northern Ireland. I don#t know that it will happen on my watch but I want to build the foundations. Mrs Long said her party#s membership had doubled in two years. She believed it could now win Assembly seats in West Tyrone, Upper Bann, East Londonderry and North Antrim next time and take two in some other constituencies so it would be challenging for between  and  seats and added that she had no regrets about entering the Executive rather than going into opposition. You can#t ask people to make compromises when you#re not willing to do so yourself, she said. I don#t want to be outside the room criticising what#s going on, I want to be inside trying to shape it. The biggest challenge is to avoid thisbecoming highly personalised and about iniduals.

The parties would cross swords at times but there had been no fireworks. There was an open, healthy debate at the table.There are some bumps in the road ahead, she said. The budget will be dficult, the RHI report won#t be easy. But it should not be used as an opportunity to tear strips off each other and make things more dficult. The biggest challenge is to avoid thisbecoming highly personalised and about iniduals. It#s about addressing the systemic failures and ensuring that those things done wrong in the past won#t happen again.She said she didn#t knowthe report would recommend police investigations, potential prosecutions for illegality or whether the conclusion would be that the RHI scheme was just badly managed.She said progress had already been made on addressing some of the issues raised at the cash-for-ash inquiry - codes of practice and pay for special advisers, ministerial accountability, transparency and record keeping.On the murder of Paul Quinn, Mrs Long called on Sinn Fein Finance Minister Conor Murphy to specically and unambiguously state that the -year-old Cullyhanna man wasn#t a criminal. I wouldn#t be as presumptuous as some to say a border poll is inevitable in five or  years, but I do think it is more likely than it was previouslyWhen you#re a politician, you have a lot of influence. What you say carries weight in the community. You#re an opinion-former. So when you say somebody#s a criminal, that has implications for whether people are willing to come forward with information to the police, she said.It is important that Conor does say that Paul Quinn wasn#t a criminal. The pain that Breege and Stephen have been through is horrendous. Their son#s awful death was added to by the fact that he was smeared publicly.They live this nightmare every day. I would hope that Conor would find it within himself to bring a measure of peace to this family.Asked about the possibility of a border poll in her letime, Mrs Long said the chances had increased due to Brexit.I wouldn#t be as presumptuous as some to say a border poll is inevitable in five or  years, but I do think it is more likely than it was previously, she said.The theme of Alliance#s conference is # Vision# and the party will be celebrating its th anniversary. Mrs Long said she wished to pay tribute to those who came up with the idea of a cross-community party in , the grimmest of times.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   Related ContentPoliticsNaomi Long: #I don#t fully understand why MLA Trevor Lunn left#Naomi Long has said sheremains unclear as to why Lagan Valley MLA Trevor Lunnquit the Alliance Party butdismissed speculation that he felt he was being pushed aside in favour of Sorcha Eastwood.PoliticsAlliance Party rake in most donations with £kThe Alliance Party topped the list of donations received by Northern Ireland#s political parties in the last quarter of .

Almost  million boxes are distributed across Ireland, north and south, each year. www.trocaire.org lentThe appeal this year will help to support women around the world who are struggling to protect their families from intimidation, violence, hunger and drought. As part of the appeal Troacutecaire has launched a report that reveals how woman are disproportionately impacted by climate change and corporate human rights violations throughout the world.The charitys Northern Ireland chief, Siobhan Hanley, said: “‘Women Taking the Lead: Defending Human Rights and the Environment’ details the experiences of courageous women, many of whom are engaged in defending their communities against the effects of corporate greed and the devastating environmental impact of climate change. By contributing to our Lenten Appeal, people in Co Derry will be providing vital aid, care and support to these brave women.”Bertita Zuacutentildeiga Caacuteceres, leader of the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organisations of Honduras– an organisation supported by Troacutecaire – attended the launch of the report.Bertita’s mother, Berta Caacuteceres, an internationally renowned activist and winner of the environmental Goldman Prize, was shot dead in  after a long battle to stop construction of an internationally financed hydroelectric dam on the Gualcarque river, which the indigenous Lenca people consider sacred.Bertita was present to speak about her own experience of violence inflicted on female human rights defenders and the indigenous community’s long struggle to defend their land from corporate abuse.While she continues the work of her mother, Bertita is being supported by Troacutecaire in seeking justice to ensure that all those responsible for the murder – the company executives and state officials identied during the resulting trial – are prosecuted.“Around the world, women face huge risks in standing up for their rights in the face of injustice perpetrated by big business taking advantage of vulnerable communities. The threat of assault and murder is a daily reality for many of these women, who are fighting for their families to live better lives,” said Siobhan Hanley.“Women are also disproportionately affected by poverty, which is made worse by the effects of climate change on some of the world’s poorest people.

A spokesperson for JPM Contracts said they were honoured to be part of the team which has restored the castle to its former glory.“It is not every day you get to be involved working in a medieval castle, especially of such high signicance,” the spokesperson said.“The work started in March  to replace the existing flat roof which has been in place for the past  years. The new roof is keeping with the late-medieval architecture of the Castle.“It has made from Irish Oak used ‘green’ and oak-pegged without the use of nails or metal fixings.Storm Ophelia“The Irish Oak was sourced from oak trees which came down in Wicklow during Storm Ophelia in October .“The new roof is a series of open trusses and rafters carrying oak boards.“Externally the roof is finished in Cumbrian stone slates and lead.“The external appearance of the Castle does not look signicantly dferent from ground level as the roof is behind the battlements.“However, internally, the Great Hall at the top of the Tower has been transformed into a higher, brighter and more historically resonant space.”Minister for Communities Deirdre Hargey said: “This investment has secured the future of this important monument and prevented irreparable damage to the structure.“Archaeologists and conservation architects within the department worked together to design a historically appropriate roof,” said the Minister.“What has been achieved is an outstanding piece of architecture that safeguards this important and historic place.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoe Clarke, from Ballykelly, is an Engagement Ambassador for VOYPIC and told the County Derry Post that the evening was a great success.She said: “We had a few children singing the Bare Necessities and they had the whole crowd going.“It’s a  to highlight and show appreciation for the talents of these young people that might get bypassed in other areas.“It gives them a chance to stand on that stage and show who they are. One young boy performed his own rap at the event.“It was about being in care, his le at home and his feelings and emotions towards his social workers. Everyone in the room could relate to it.”The -year-old credits the organisation with a great deal of her own success.She said: “I became known to the organisation when I was about   and without them, I don’t think I would be where I am today.“I grew up care experienced and lived on the edge of care my whole le but at , I was made homeless. I lived in Jefferson’s Court on Shipquay Street.“That’s when I became known to VOYPIC, because I wasn’t getting what I was actually entitled to. If you are classied as a LAC, you are provided accommodation by social services.“I wasn’t. I was completely overlooked.”VOYPIC plays a crucial role in making sure that young people in care have access to the support and information they need to make informed decisions about their lives.With offices in Derry, Belfast, Ballymena and Lurgan, another aspect of the charity’s work is filling gaps in the information available to young people in and on the edge of care.Aoe says it is easy for some young people to slip through the cracks.“A lot of young people living on the edge of care can easily fly under the radar and I don’t think information is publicised enough for them to know what they’re entitled to.“I had a really bad experience with the teachers in secondary school because they just didn’t get it at all. It’s hard to expect people to get itthey’ve never received any training.”Aoe is currently in her final year of a psychology degree at Ulster University in Coleraine and, in her role with VOYPIC, is determined to make a dference to those currently re-living her experience.“I’m doing my dissertation on educational pathways to rd level education, specically for care leavers.“A lot of the students I’ve interviewed indicated they weren’t aware of the support available to them – we want to change that.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Clare grew up in Derrys Brandywell and was a popular and outgoing girl who and dreamed of being famous. googletag.cmd.push By her late teens, she had secured an agent and was on the verge a successful acting career, but like many girls her age she spent her weekends drinking in pubs and clubs. She wasnt a bit religious growing up, her sister, Shauna Gill, remembered. We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

You don’t have time to be looking at social media – there’s a job to be done. “For two hours, I was constantly on the phone back and forth to the ious authorities. “I was hopeful and then some of the guys at the airport dashed that, saying they were impounding the plane. But I stayed focused and we eventually got the news we wanted.” At the time, Peter was unaware of the flight’s signicance as Flybe’s last, but he took time today to reflect on the impact the airline has had, particularly on Belfast City Airport. googletag.cmd.push He said: “It’s a letime for me – I’ve been there  years. It’s more of a family than just a job. “It will be a massive blow. I know a lot of the staff at the airport and watched it grow from a couple of tin shacks to what it is today. “It’s a lovely wee compact airport and it’s modern but it was Nissen huts in  when I started. At the centre of the south Derry man’s thinking was passenger welfare, so much so that the plane was further delayed to allow a group of workers coming from Aberdeen to board. “We were all ready to go and we got a call saying Aberdeen was inbound with seven guys from the rigs. “Those guys were depending on us to get home, so we waited and got them on board. A lot of people were relying on Flybe to get to and from their jobs.” Peter admits it is a concerning time for all staff at the airline and revealed that getting any form of payment from the company could be dficult. He said: “We won’t get any form of payment from the company because it’s gone into administration. Any pay that’s owed, we won’t get that. “Maybe down the line there will be some form of payment, but there’s nothing we can use to pay our bills.” The pilot, who flies hot air balloons in his spare time, has planned to get the staff together at a later stage to try and keep spirits up, but in the meantime has received a unique job offer. “On a positive note, a friend rang me to tell me he needed a shepherd to look after his sheep on the Glenshane and askedI was available. “I said ‘sure, I’ll take anything!’. That’s my first job offer and it’s not even  hours yet.” “I’m glad we stayed with the process and got everyone back home. At least that’s some consolation.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ryan McGeough was coached by Gregg at Portstewart FC for three or four years as a teenager. “My mum texted me about his death and I couldnt believe it,” McGeough said. “I hadnt seen him in a few years and I would have loved to run into him and have a yarn but unfortunately I never got the chance.” Gregg, who was voted as the best goalkeeper of the  World Cup, a native of Tobermore, passed away at the age of  and aside from his talents between the posts he was most famous in football circles for his heroics during the Munich air disaster in February  which claimed the lives of  people. googletag.cmd.push Harry pulled some of his team-mates from the burning plane, after disaster struck on theirjourney from a European Cup victory over Red Star Belgrade. Among those he saved were Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and manager Sir Matt Busby. Harry played  games but was a larger than le presence. Anybody who ever had a conversation with Harry would have remembered it,” stated Irish FA Chief Executive Patrick Nelson in a statement to the County Derry Post. Gregg started his club career with Windsor Park Swts, the reserve team of Linfield, before signing for his local club Coleraine. At the age of  he earned a move to Second Division side Doncaster Rovers before switching to Manchester United for pound,, which was a world record fee for a goalkeeper at the time and made  appearances for the Red Devils. googletag.cmd.push He entered management and became manager of Shrewsbury Town, before taking charge of Swansea City, Crewe Alexandra and Carlisle United. Gregg also had a spell as goalkeeping coach at Manchester United and as assistant manager at Swindon Town. Harry was appointed an MBE by The Queen in  for services to football, and was then made an OBE in , also for services to football. Each week the Harry Gregg Foundation facilitates a wide range of activities for thousands of people in the Coleraine area and beyond through participation in football and ious other activities. Sir Alex Ferguson, who took his United team to play in Harrys testimonial in Belfast in , paid a tribute on Manchester Uniteds Official Website. “Harry was a man of great character and a true legend at our club. I remember that he was always very excited and proud to host our youth team at his boarding house for the Milk Cup every summer, so he could recount the tales of his playing days. I loved his company and the many pieces of advice he gave me.” While back in Ireland, Gregg bought the Windsor Hotel in Portstewart and began coaching the local soccer team. One player who remembers him fondly was goalkeeper Ryan McGeough who would go on to win two Derry championship medals with Coleraine GAA team. GREGG THE COACH “He was thecoach but as a goalkeeper you got a lot more attention from him than everybody. He was the first goalkeeper coach I ever came across that made the goalkeepers train with the outfielders. “Ray Woods was an England capped goalkeeper whenUnited won the league in   and they bought Harry for a record fee. “Harry said to me the only reason why they bought him was that Woods was a linie,” recalls McGeough, referring to Woods reluctance to leave his six-yard box. “Harry was the first goalkeeper to sweep outside his box and cover for defenders. He would always have had you out in the box organising your defenders.” McGeough soon learned Greggs approach to goalkeeping during one of those coaching sessions with Portstewart. “Peter Schmeichel was my hero and having played European handball, he brought in the spreading himself”, McGeough continues, explaining the Danes trademark star-jump, making himself as imposing as possible. Harry Gregg didnt agree and stopped his young proteacutegeacute advancing a la Schmeichel during training.   It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. Ryan McGeough  “He dropped the ball and said you, e on it and you , challenge him. If you do the spread again, you will do this all night. In Harrys era, you ed and took the ball and man. “It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. I havent spread myself since in case Harry was watching,” laughs the affable McGeough. “He would have taken it as serious coaching a  year old as a senior.” “He taught you how to manipulate forwards on a one on one and force the forward to make the first move. What he was teaching was far and beyond seen before. “If another manager, who is not a goalkeeper, says something to you, you could question it butHarry said something to you - you just did it. “Wed sit around the changing room listening to him for an hour and a half after training. Hed be telling us stories about Best, Charlton and Busby. When you are a big Man Utd head, you are in dreamland listening to him.” McGeough speaks of how goalkeeping has changed and in the era of televised games too much of the routines being similar. “In Harrys day there were so many dferent styles and I would prefer to play the way Harry played.” READ ALSO - He was larger than le on the pitch.

The Candystripes have failed to win at the RSC since , and they didn’t look likely of ending that run as they were second best for the majority of this game in what a disappointing showing from Declan Devine’s team. It was all Waterford in the first  minutes but Derry City could well have taken the lead out of the blue when Walter Figueira bamboozled Tyrkee Wilson with a superb piece of skill to break into the area, before driving a shot across goal which beat Brian Murphy but just passed the post of the Waterford goalkeeper. googletag.cmd.push At the other end Michael O’Connor as causing the City defence all sorts of problems and he did well to evade Eoin Toal on the half hour before firing in a wicked shot which Peter Cherrie did well to hold. The home side were stunned just past the half hour though when Colm Horgan won a free kick and with the hosts reacting too slowly, Derry took the kick quickly and Mallon raced into the area and caught Murphy out with a fine finish to give City the lead. The home side took a while to respond but they hit back just before half time when Derry failed to clear from a corner kick and Cummins set up Sam Bone on the edge of the area and he fired an unstoppable and brilliant shot past Cherrie and into the top corner to bring the home side level. googletag.cmd.push Waterford started the second half as they started the first and took the game to Derry, coming close when John Martin twisted and turned in the box but shot straight at Cherrie. The home side kept pushing and they came close again when Coote dummied a free kick  yards from goal and O’Connor curled a brilliant effort towards goal only for Cherrie to get two hands to the ball to push it behind for a corner. Waterford looked more likely in the remainder of the game and they won it deep into added time when Shane Grfin lashed the ball into the net to send the Candystripes crashing to a deserved defeat. Teams Waterford: Murphy, Odimayo, Wilson, Bone, Coote , O’Connor, Smith, Martin , O’Connor, McCourt, Cummins. Derry City: Cherrie, Horgan, Toal, Lupano, McChrystal, McCormack, Harkin, McDonagh , Figueira , Mallon, Nilsen . REFEREE: S Grant.

Both acts put on lively performances that were thoroughly enjoyed by the packed crowd, but Cumann Pheadar Naofa impressed the judges most with their eight-hand reel and were crowned champions.Next up was solo the singing and the standards were outstandingly high. Ardglass, Mayobridge , Mayobridgeand Saul were all represented in the category and from an audience point of view it would seem an impossible job for the judges to separate the performances.They did manage it though and Mayobridgersquos Eimear Magee took the title with a beautul performance of Orphan Girl.The recitation category followed and the audience was treated to four heartfelt performances from Attical, Saul, Darragh Cross and Rostrevor.Clare McCartan of Attical recited an extract from Frank McCourtrsquos Angelarsquos Ashes lsquoMy First Holy Communionrsquo and the performance filled the audience with both laughter and nostalgia, which resulted in Clare being declared champion.The audience were treated to four wonderful ballad performances from Ballymartin, Bryansford, Saul and Mayobridge.Every performance was flawless and the talent on stage was outstanding, but it was the experienced Saul group who were awarded first placen with two wonderful performances mdash Leaving The Blaskett Islands and Homeland.Before the interval Cumman Pheadar Naofa performed a set dance. Although they were the only performers in the category, they didnrsquot allow the standards to slip and their performance was enjoyed by all.After the interval, Drumaness, Attical, Clann Na Bann and Bryansford had the audience laughing and giggling with their novelty acts.There were male nuns on the run, an Irish wake with a dference and a club struggling to form a Scoacuter quiz team, but it was Bryansfordrsquos performance of lsquoThe Passport Officersquo that won the title after showing the audience what le is like in an Irish passport office and what it takes to prove your Irishness.The final category of the night was the instrumental music. Clann Na Banna, Attical, Cumann Pheadar Naofa and Mayobridge all competed and ended the show with a high.Cumann Pheadar Naofa stole the show with beautul performances of The Maid at the Spinning Wheel, Andersonrsquos Reel and The New Mown Meadows.The standard of performances at Scoacuter Sinsir this year has been exceptional and is a testimony to the vast amount of talented performers within Down and the time and dedication put in by GAA clubs at promoting and nurturing culture within the county.Another massive thank you must go out to all the volunteers who help make Scoacuter possible, from setting up the stage and sound, adjudicating, judging, doing Fir Ban Na Ti, providing hospitality, selling tickets, doing the door and so on.Finally, well done to all performers and good luck to all those who will compete in the Ulster Scoacuter semi-final in Glenullin next week..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Building.jpg","title":"Building work begins on ‘eyesore’ car park  ","story":"WORK has started on a new car park at the former Down Council headquarters in Downpatrick.A contractor is currently on site at the Strangford Road working on an area to the side and front of the remains of the townrsquos historic workhouse.The site of the former local authority base was being used as an unofficial parking area for bin lorries and other refuse vehicles, but late last year planning permission was secured to formally designate the area as a car park for both council vehicles and staff cars.Concerned residents who live nearby had expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the old workhouse as an ldquoeyesore and highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.Part of a main car park adjacent to the Orchard Way housing development will be used to form the main entrance to the proposed new grammar school campus.In papers submitted ahead of a planning meeting when formal approval for the new car park was granted, it was revealed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admitted that the car park plan would impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.But they confirmed that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accepted the parking plan in principle.In addition, government officials described the existing site used for parking as ldquowell established with the planning application seeking to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans parked at the side.The planning papers added: ldquoThe works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.The formal planning approval paves the way for council officials to relocate existing staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.As part of the sale of council land to the Education Authority, there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm when the new school is constructed and opens for business..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Classy.jpg","title":"Classy Oisin helps Down into league showdown  ","story":"DOWN earned a well-deserved two points in Liatroim on Sunday afternoon and all but secured a place in the isional final.A mid-week change of venue to Liatroim meant this encounter was played on a pristine surface, ensuring a thrilling encounter, which Roacutenaacuten Sheehan said was a massive contributing factor to today win.ldquoIrsquod like to thank all in the Liatroim club, to take the game at such short notice was a credit to them. The facilities and the carpet like surface of Fontenoy Park was a massive boost for us today, and suited our fast-open style of play.Kildare knew that a nothing less than a win would be good enough and despite playing into the wind, were quickest out of the blocks, opening up a - to - lead in the opening quarter with Jack Sheridan and Brian Byrne frees punishing Down indiscretions.A fourth minute Chris Egan point being Downrsquos only score from play in the first quarter.Sheehan got his match-ups spot on, as Caolan Taggart and John McManus put the shackles on Kildarersquos James Burke and Sheridan to minimise any threat on goal.Down created lots of scoring opportunities in the first half, but just couldnrsquot convert them, whilst Danny Toner and midfielder Pearse Oacuteg McCrickard got through a trojan amount of work around the middle of the park to keep the pressure on the Lilywhites.Down hit a period of ascendancy inside the final five minutes of the half, trailing - to -, Danny Toner struck over from  metres on  minutes and after MacManus pointed from outside the  metre line, Ronan Costello broke free from the attentions of Rian Boran in added time to fire over the bar, when a goal could so easily have resulted.MacManus, playing on home soil, opened the scoring seconds into the restart, firing over from  metres, before adding a free a minute later,much to the pleasure of the local home support.Kildare nosed out in front again, only to see the first of three second half Conor Woods monster frees from deep inside the Down half and a Matt Conlon score, tie matters for the third time. McCrickard sent over a wondrous  metre side line for the lead score.But disaster struck minutes when Shane Ryan rounded Mark Patterson and his shot flew past Stephen Keith, Kildare were up by one.The game was finely balanced as Egan levelled for the hosts once more and with Kildare having a game in hand over Down and the dayrsquos prize a league final spot in two weeks, Paul Divilly scored Kildarersquos final point, but Down pushed for the line and got the last four scores, two MacManus frees and two more long distance strikes from the impressive Conor Woods.Roacutenaacuten Sheehan was impressed with his sides work rate: ldquoWe were slow to settle in the first  minutes, given this was the biggest test wersquove had since the Derry game, he said.ldquoEoghan Sands led up front, and although we missed two to three goal chances, we kept our composure in the tackle and kept plugging away, once more Danny Toner had a brilliant game and with the experience of Caolan Taggart and Darragh Mallon in defence, Kildare were going to have out work us for every score.Down: S Keith, M Patterson, J McManus, D Mallon, C Taggart, C Woods , G Hughes, M Conlon , P Oacuteg McCrickard , R Costello , R McCusker, D Toner , O MacManus , E Sands, C Egan .

Itrsquos the least we can do in his memory to promote his brainchild. Irsquom certain we could get the backing of everyonepermission is granted.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Down Council chairman, Mr Eddie McVeigh, has renewed his plea to local planners to help the Housing Executive rind sites for housing development in Ballynahinch.Mr McVeigh said the Executive were anxious to build in Ballynahinch, but they had been repeatedly thwarted because they had been unable to find sites which met with the plannersrsquo approval.Mr McVeigh was speaking after planners turned down an application from the Executive to build on the Magheraknock Road. The application was refused because the planners considered the site was outside the area considered suitable for residential development.The planners consider there is sufficient land available for residential development in Ballynahinch. This is the comment which constantly annoys Mr McVeigh.DOWNPATRICK mdash Controversy over road proposals for Downpatrick town centre can be settled by compromise, according to the local chamber of trade.Traders are strongly opposed to DoE Roads Service recommendations for a through road which were published in the Recorder last month.They dislike the thought of a main road with high retaining walls cutting the town in two and are keen to meet officials in the hope that agreement can be reached.Mr Jim Cassidy, newly elected chairman of Downpatrick Chamber of Trade, is quietly confident that the designersrsquo commendable ideas can be better merged with local needs as the business people and residents see them.ldquoThere is considerable opposition for very valid reasons to the plan, he said. ldquoWe believe that the town centre should not be carved up by a road crossing Scotch Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoThe feeling among members is that a major traffic route should by-pass Down Cathedral and join the Newcastle Road. Without doubt, the traffic load in the town must be eased.ldquoOurs is not a modern town, but has character that should not be destroyed in an attempt to modernise everything.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Town Committee is to throw its full weight behind an anti-litter campaign.The committee are considering launching a special design scheme for three schools in the town and are investigating the possibility of mapping out a programme to make local people more aware of the litter problem.The schoolsrsquo competition is an exciting idea aimed at getting pupils in the local high school and two primary schools to design a clean-up scheme, with prizes for the winners. A best kept garden competition is another idea.The town committee hopes to tie all the events into Down Councilrsquos anti-litter campaign later this year when a prize of pound will be awarded to the best kept town or village in the council area.Some members of the town committee, however, fear Killyleagh could get off to a bad start in the competition because of the major housing redevelopment schemes at Shore Street and Irish Street, and the overall shabby appearance of roads and footpaths in the area.DUNDRUM mdash Ambitious plans to make Dundrum Regatta and Sports bigger and better were drawn at the Regatta Committeersquos annual meeting in the Bay Inn on Monday night.Ideas to cater for teenagers, introduce a more ied programme and revert to a date in mid July were considered at the well attended meeting.Before the election of officers, which saw Mr Hugh Graham re-elected as chairman and Mr Pierce Rice appointed secretary, the committee congratulated Mr Dan McNeill for his -year association with the committee,  of which were spent as chairman.One of the more pleasing aspects to come out of the meeting was the formation of a group, to be known as the teenage committee, which will should out what teenagers want to see in the programme of events, this ensuring young, middle-aged and elderly will be catered for. The dates for this yearrsquos Regatta are July -.LOUGHINISLAND mdash Loughinisland hasnrsquot had a public phone kiosk since it was knocked down by a lorry three years ago.

The local development association say they have been conned mdash and  residents agree with them.The row relates to the possible side effects of the Department of the Environmentrsquos scheme to meet the townrsquos needs on whig work began last year and was abandoned a few months ago.For more than ten years there has been intense opposition to a sewerage collection tank located close to the townrsquos slipway.

Any fair minded assessment of its local track record over the last decade would be damning to say the least.ldquoRecords suggest that Invest NI has only hosted one potential investor in the local area in  years. That is an astonishing failure and an indictment on an organisation that appears to suffer nose bleeds once it moves beyond the Belfast area.ldquoIndeed, Invest NIrsquos focus appears to have been solely directed at throwing cash incentives at investors to locate in Belfast at the expense of incubating local small and medium enterprises in areas like South Down.Mr Hazzard claimed that South Down has been one of the worst performing areas in terms of Invest NI assistance, despite the fact that the organisation has  acres of land holdings in the area mdash the biggest in the province.The MP added: ldquoI will be meeting with the new Invest NI chief executive in the weeks ahead to impress upon him the the importance of creating a regionally balanced economy and developing a much more ambitious vision for creating and supporting economic opportunities in South Down.Ms Rogan said the fact that no one from Invest NI had met with potential investors in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area for such a long time was ldquounacceptable, suggesting that this was ldquoreminiscent of decades of discrimination and neglect of the area by British and unionist governments.Ms Rogan confirmed that she has written to the economy minister to ask why Invest NI hosted no potential investors in South Down for such a long period and asked what she intends to do to address the ldquoserious imbalance compared to all other constituencies.A spokeswoman for Invest NI said the organisation and Northern Irelandrsquos  councils were actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of the province.She said that investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.ldquoOver the past years, we have offered over poundm of support to businesses across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area, including  externally owned companies.

Ryan Wilson ed at inside centre and Conor Rankin came in on the wing with Ross Adair at full back.Up front, Bradley Luney continued in the number seven jersey with Conall Boomer on the bench as his recovery from a knee ligament injury continues to be managed.The match itself was a tight affair, dictated by a dficult, swirling wind and Ballynahinch did superbly well to overcome the concession of a try to Lansdowne flyer Peter Sullivan and the sin-binning of Luney, to lead - at half-time thanks to two well-taken penalties from Hutley.The defence in particular was vastly improved and this continued in the second half as the game turned into a real dogfight with defence on top.Skipper John Donnan and his fellow lock Jack Regan led the way with outstanding work in defence and huge work rate around the park with Chris Gibson having an impressive stint off the bench at scrum-half, but a penalty at a ruck around half way allowed Lansdowne to work themselves into an excellent field position as the game reached its conclusion and they manufactured the winning score.The losing bonus point kept the locals well in touch with their fellow strugglers, Trinity and University College Cork as both lost at home.Terenurersquos victory at the Mardyke looks to have pulled them clear of any relegation issues and although Ballynahinch are bottom of the table on  points, they remain just one behind UCC and three behind Trinity.The next two games against high flying Garryowen and UCD will be a huge challenge before a blockbuster home game against UCC on March .

It is not yet clear at what point new lts will be installed at the Cloonagh Road facility.Local drivers who were due to have their vehicles tested have been granted a four-month extension of their existing certicate and are expected to be informed of their new test dates over the coming weeks.Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon has confirmed that following the discovery of faults with lts in MoT centres in late January, her priority was the safety of DVA staff and customers.She said that since news of the faulty vehicle lts emerged, she acted quickly to minimise inconvenience to the public and allow drivers to tax their vehicles and continue to drive.Ms Mallon said that she has been examining all of the options to resume normal business as quickly and safely as possible, including the commissioning of two independent reviews to provide her with expert advice on the condition of the existing lts, the events that led to the situation and how it can be avoided in future.ldquoI have now been given the first report from the independent engineering expertrsquos assessment on the condition of the existing lts, she confirmed.ldquoIt has recommended that all lts with faults identied should be replaced, not repaired. The second audit investigation report has not been completed, however, it has highlighted that there are no issues with the purchasing of this equipment from the existing supplier.The infrastructure minister said she has decided to replace all  lts across MoT centres at a cost of pound.m.She continued: ldquoIt is clear that an inadequate inspection regime and metal fatigue led to this situation. I have therefore instructed my officials to put in place an improved equipment replacement cycle and regular robust inspection and maintenance, with an additional layer of independent inspection built into the new contract.ldquoUntil the lts are operational, the advice to customers remains the same. All vehicles will have the necessary cover to allow them to remain on the road, either through a temporary exemption certicate or a priority appointment.Ms Mallon said that road safety is a priority for her and she reminded drivers that they also have a responsibility to ensure their vehicles are roadworthy at all times.The minister continued: ldquoThe priority vehicle contact line, for owners of four year old vehicles, taxis and car dealerships, will continue to operate to make it easier for these vehicle owners to contact DVA for an urgent appointment.ldquoTemporary exemption certicates will continue to be issued to all cancelled customers, enabling the public to continue to use their cars and all customers who have been cancelled will receive a full refund of their booking fee.The infrastructure minister said that while the steps she has taken willtest centres to full capacity safely and swtly, the situation has brought to light the need to improve the MoT system and centres and this is something she will be considering in the months ahead.Ms Mallon added: ldquoI will continue to keep this matter under review and as the position changes and the new lts become operational I will ensure that the public are fully informed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 MP.jpg","title":"MP presses roads minister to give assurance on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been urged to provide a public assurance that delivery of the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for the Department for Infrastructure.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard and comes just weeks after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to seek a meeting with the minister to make the case for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed poundm scheme.The multi-million pound project has been shovel ready for some time, with local politicians hoping that the government department will allocate funding for the near two-mile scheme which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete.The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district and roads officials have insisted that the bypass will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard mdash who formally signed-off the proposal to start work on the by-pass in December  when he was infrastructure minister mdash has written to the new minister.He said it has been six weeks since Ms Mallon took the reins at the government department, claiming Ballynahinch businesses and commuters were beginning to question the ldquolack of public commentary on the bypass issue.The MP continued: ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready, yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead.ldquoI have once again asked the Department to provide an update on this long overdue scheme. Hopefully, the minister will take this opportunity to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department,and it is not being relegated for an alternative project where.Work on a major ground condition survey along the route of the by-pass has been completed, as has an archaeological investigation. Progression to the construction stage remains subject to clearing statutory procedures and securing finance.Roads officials have previously confirmed that given the scale of the multi-million pound scheme, the Department of Infrastructure is required to carry out archaeological and geotechnical investigations along the route of the by-pass.In addition, they say the ious surveys and other work is being completed in advance to ensure that key pieces of the development jigsaw are in place when the bid for funding is made.A spokeswoman for the department said the minister recognised that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch.ldquoUnfortunately, the minister has inherited severe and challenging budget constraints. However, recognising the importance of the Ballynahinch bypass and many others schemes within her Department, the minister is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland, she said.ldquoThe minister is currently assessing the pressures across her department reflecting her priorities, the commitments in the New Decade: New Approach document and the budget made available for the period ahead.

Indeed, the document contained a promise to walk away from talks in June, unless the ‘broad outline’ of a trade deal is already in place. That will give the government time to ‘focus solely on continuing domestic preparations to exit the transition period in an orderly fashion’.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...To you or me, that means they will be getting ready for a possible no-deal outcome, and it could easily include preparing infrastructure to carry out checks at Irish Sea ports.This seeming acceptance of the Northern Ireland protocol is at odds with Boris Johnson’s rhetoric about ‘unfettered access’ between all parts of the UK market. And it doesn’t tally with reports that the prime minister has instructed his Brexit team to draw up plans to avoid implementing checks on goods moving from Great Britain to NI.The EU certainly believes that Johnson must start erecting a border in the Irish Sea. Michel Barnier described checks between the mainland and Northern Ireland as an ‘indispensable’ element of the Withdrawal Agreement.That document effectively requires Northern Ireland to remain in the single market, for goods and agriculture at least, as the rest of the country leaves at the end of the year. In addition, we must continue to apply the EU customs code and, by default, that means businesses here paying up-front tarfs on goods they bring in from Great Britain for processing.Extraordinarily, the DUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson told the BBC this week that customs checks could represent an ‘opportunity’ for businesses in Northern Ireland. He dismissed the notion that a customs border has implications for British sovereignty here. Now, even the biggest unionist party seems prepared to go along with this ‘best of both worlds’ hokum. In fact, although the protocol may seem rather technical, it’s likely to affect every single person living here. This week, The ’s Brexit Bulletin reported that a major supermarket estimates that the price of ferrying a trailer of groceries to Northern Ireland could go up by %, or £, per consignment, thanks to potential new administration and veterinary costs. It’s inconceivable that such drastic price rises will not be passed on to consumers.The government continues to deny that the protocol will have such drastic consequences. The new secretary of state, Brandon Lewis, claims, “there will not be a border down the Irish Sea, there will be unfettered access for business”, while a Downing Street statement asserts there will be “limited changes” to trade between GB and NI. In the House of Lords, Treasury minister, Lord Agnew, told Lord Empey that some “light touch regulation” may be needed.All these terms — ‘unfettered access’, ‘limited changes’ and ‘light-touch regulation’ — are vague enough to allow the government to simply downplay the scale of any disruption rather than prevent it. Meanwhile, The Sunday Times, reports that a senior Downing Street source says “there is deadly serious internal work going on about not obeying the Northern Ireland protocol”. The implication is that Johnson knows fine well that the Withdrawal Agreement includes checks on goods, an internal-UK trade border and other features that, to a layman, appear to be in the document in black and white.The paper claims that Geoffrey Cox, the former attorney general, was replaced by Suella Braverman during the cabinet reshuffle because he was not prepared to issue advice that allowed the government to reinterpret the Northern Ireland protocol. It looks like the prime minister is searching for a legal rationale to back up his insistence that the deal doesn’t require checks between Great Britain and Ulster. At best, it’s a risky, counterintuitive strategy,For unionists who aren’t Jeffrey Donaldson, it’s might seem like a relief that Johnson at least recognises that there is a problem with the protocol. Northern Ireland sells four times more goods to Great Britain than it exports to the Republic, so it’s perverse that the focus of our politicians and lobbyists was on preventing any hardening of the Irish land border rather than avoiding trade barriers in the Irish Sea. It was glaringly obvious that the Withdrawal Agreement threatened to cut Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK. The easiest way to avoid the worst barriers to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is still to sign a comprehensive trade deal with the EU evenit’s understandable that British negotiators don’t wish to appear too desperate to achieve that outcome.Maybe the government can devise a plan to avoid the worst aspects of the Withdrawal Agreement, but it doesn’t seem likely. If the prime minister really is making an effort to escape the Northern Ireland protocol, and unionists would be naive to take that for granted, why on earth did he sign up to it in the first place \"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents.

Victims are regularly kept updated on progress of investigations.ldquoWe are dedicated to making our communities even safer by preventing and reducing crime and building on our success in solving crime and seeking justice for victims.ldquoCompared to similar forces in the UK, South Wales Police is the best performing force on recorded crime and there is a  per cent lower chance of being a victim of crime in South Wales than where.ldquoThere was a  per cent year-on-year reduction in burglaries in the Bridgend and Vale of Glamorgan area, where people are far less likely to become a victim of burglary than where in South Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
