In that time, more than 20,000 people took part in the show seeking help to resolve relationship issues, or to address drug or alcohol related problems. \u0027The central purpose of the show was conflict resolution, and the show achieved many positive outcomes where people were able to resolve personal problems.\u0027The Jeremy Kyle Show had extensive and detailed duty of care processes in place for contributors built up over 14 years. \u0027It had a dedicated guest welfare team of mental healthcare professionals with decades of experience in NHS mental healthcare, who were focused on the welfare of guests throughout the production process. \u0027Guests were supported by the programme and welfare teams prior to filming, throughout filming and after filming. \u0027Should they require ongoing help then appropriate solutions were found for them, which could include residential rehabilitation, counselling, anger management, family mediation, child access mediation or couples counselling.\u0027Due to the gravity of events in May 2019, namely the death of a guest a few days after taking part in the show, ITV decided to end production of the show. \u0027It would not be appropriate for ITV to comment further on that in advance of the inquest to be held later this month, other than to say that our sympathies are with Mr Dymond\u0027s family and friends.\u0027ITV does not accept the central allegation of this programme of a \u0027bad culture\u0027 within the production team. \u0027We note that the programme includes anonymous former production members claiming wrongdoing by themselves and others, without supporting evidence.

All guests gave their informed consent, in writing, to take part.\u0027Since 2018 ITV has taken significant steps in relation to its duty of care of participants. ITV issued detailed new guidance to all its producers on protecting participants in October 2019, which represents industry-leading good practice and now reflects the changes to the Broadcasting Code made by industry regulator Ofcom in 2021. \u0027ITV also ensures greater management oversight of participant welfare through a Duty of Care Board, and has created a Mental Health Advisory group involving mental health charities to advise ITV on its policies for staff and programme guests.\u0027Channel 4 said: \u0027Jeremy Kyle was approached for a response to the series.

Whilst it might deter some people from going out, it might incentivise others for going out. I think there\u0027s a difficult balance to take there.\u0027There were 1,996 people in Scottish hospitals on Monday with recently confirmed Covid, up 191 on the previous day, with 33 in intensive care, up six.That is higher than the Omicron peak of 1,571 which was recorded in January this year, with more patients in hospital than at any time since January 27 last year when the total was 2,016.Dr Tait Burkard, a research fellow at the University of Edinburgh\u0027s Roslin Institute and an expert on coronaviruses, said that while masks help reduce virus levels in public places, they are less effective against Omicron and BA.2.She suggested that vulnerable people should be advised to upgrade their masks to FFP2 or N95 masks for more protection.The academic said: \u0027The impacts that the mask wearing makes without many of the other restrictions in place is small, or it\u0027s smaller than it ever was before.\u0027One (reason) is that unfortunately with Omicron the kind of less protective masks, the simple surgical masks, the thin ones that you just ring round your ears, the fabric ones, they\u0027re not as protective as they were against the previous variants, just because we need to inhale less of the virus to get infected, so both time of exposure needed to get infected is less, but they still help reducing virus level in public places, and especially for vulnerable people that can make the difference.\u0027But there should be also the advice that for vulnerable people it might be a good moment, or probably a very pertinent moment, to upgrade masks to so-called FFP2 or N95 masks, the thicker ones that fit very closely around your face to protect yourself more than others.\u0027Fourth round of Covid vaccinations could start next week after slow rollout criticised"},{"url":null,"title":"Boris kicks visit Saudi Arabia Abu Dhabi","story":"Share this article   Prince Mohammed bin Salman has largely been shunned by the West after US intelligence alleged he ordered the murder of Mr Khashoggi at the kingdom\u0027s consulate in Istanbul, something the Saudi ruler denies.One person who did embrace him, however, was the Russian president, with the prince and Mr Putin sharing a high-five and a laugh at a G20 summit in the month after Mr Khashoggi\u0027s death.Mr Johnson, who will be deputised at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions on Wednesday by Justice Secretary Dominic Raab, has argued he needs to \u0027build the widest possible coalition\u0027 to address Mr Putin\u0027s attack on Ukraine.The Prime Minister is expected to discuss the importance of allies increasing the diplomatic and economic pressure on the Kremlin while mitigating the global fallout from the war.Conservative MP Julian Lewis, who chairs Parliament\u0027s Intelligence and Security Committee, called on the Government to ensure that \u0027in seeking to lessen our dependence upon one source of oil and gas, we do not end up creating a source dependency on another unreliable and sometimes hostile regime\u0027.Mr Johnson, who travelled overnight before starting the trip in the UAE on Wednesday morning, is being joined by investment minister Lord Grimstone."},{"url":null,"title":"People avoiding driving work taking kids school soaring fuel prices","story":"Share this articleOil theft on the rise in rural areas as energy costs soar"},{"url":null,"title":"Liz Truss suggests Chelseas Roman Abramovich Putin cronies NEVER welcome UK","story":"Share this article She said the UK was working with allies \u0027in the G7 and beyond\u0027 to ensure oligarchs have \u0027nowhere where it is legitimate for them to live their lifestyles, have their yachts or have their planes\u0027.Last night it was reported that ownership of an investment company linked to Mr Abramovich was transferred to one of the 55-year-old billionaire\u0027s closest allies the day that Russia invaded Ukraine.The Wall Street Journal said that Norma Investments Ltd -

It also puts Mr Johnson at odds with Joe Biden, the US president, who was elected promising to challenge Saudi human rights abuses and hold Prince Mohammed to account for the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Likewise, Saudi Arabia’s disastrous air war in Yemen is not likely to be subject to the same criticism as Putin’s Ukraine invasion.A war more distant and entrenched than Ukraine, Yemen’s seven-year-old conflict is nonetheless described as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. It is also fuelled by billions of pounds worth of British arms sales to Saudi Arabia.British-made bombs and planes have been implicated in scores of Saudi strikes that have killed civilians. Over half of the Saudi air force aircraft flying sorties over the country are UK-supplied, according to the Campaign Against Arms Trade, with some even dropping UK-made cluster munitions on the impoverished country.Saudi Arabia says it is defending itself against Iran-aligned Houthi rebels, which have attacked the kingdom with drones and missile strikes. But its air campaign has faced accusations of indiscriminately targeting civilians, while a blockade of Houthi-controlled areas has contributed to pushing the country to the brink of famine.Rather than pressuring Saudi Arabia to reach a peaceful solution to the conflict, Mr Johnson may be asked to pledge further weapons sales or British support for Riyadh’s security policy towards Yemen and arch-rival Iran, according to Sanam Vakil, deputy director of Chatham House’s Middle East programme.“If there is an agreement over Saudi supply I think the UK could commit to supporting the Saudi position on security issues in the region,” said Ms Vakil. Facing a cost of living crisis at home and a war in Europe that threatens to escalate, Mr Johnson may have to calculate whether that is a price worth paying for Saudi Arabia agreeing to increase oil production.More from NewsWednesday evening UK news briefing: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe on her way home as UK repays £400mPolitics latest news: Labour should ‘know better’ than to question Lord Lebedev peerage, says Dominic RaabNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe latest news: British aid worker lands in OmanVolodymyr Zelensky tells Joe Biden to \u0026#39be the leader of the free world\u0026#39 as he repeats no-fly zone pleaVladimir Medinsky: How Russia\u0026#39s former culture minister is now Putin\u0026#39s chief negotiator in Ukraine peace talks More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hunger strikes false dawns nazanin zaghari ratcliffes six year","story":"Last Christmas – the fifth she has spent with her family torn apart – Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe asked her father two simple questions. While her classmates opened presents surrounded by their families, the seven-year-old contemplated the void at the heart of their north London home, which their mother had last left on holiday in 2016, only to end up languishing in an Iranian prison cell, accused of plotting to overthrow the Islamic regime. “Why does it have to be my mummy, and when is she coming back?” Gabriella implored her father. Richard Ratcliffe, a softly-spoken City accountant who has fought tirelessly for his wife’s freedom for the past six years, could offer no answer.Indeed, ever since Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was first arrested by Iranian Revolutionary Guards at Imam Khomeini airport in April 2016, these are two questions that have dogged successive prime ministers, foreign secretaries and Britain’s most senior diplomats, and provoked a national outcry. Above all, they have left her family tormented by a nightmarish ordeal – one which now finally appears to be at an end, as she boarded a plane this lunchtime to return home.Back in 2016, the then 37-year-old Nazanin, who is of dual British-Iranian nationality, had travelled to Tehran with her 22-month-old daughter so she could meet her maternal grandparents for the first time. At the time, Nazanin worked as a project manager for the Thomson Reuters Foundation (a charity that promotes human rights and media freedom) and lived in West Hampstead with Richard. The pair first met in 2007 in London, where Nazanin studied for her masters, and married in 2009.Despite that quiet life, following her arrest the Iranian government accused her of leading a “foreign-linked hostile network” and sentenced her to five years in prison for plotting to overthrow the regime (the exact charges have never been made public).With her mother imprisoned in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where Amnesty International has reported torture of inmates, severe overcrowding and “solitary confinement in cruel and inhumane conditions”, Gabriella was sent to live with her maternal grandparents nearby, in the hope she might be able to keep visiting her in prison.As the months passed, Gabriella’s English started to falter and within six months, she could only speak in Farsi. After starting nursery in Tehran she told her classmates: “My mummy is in prison, my daddy is in London.”Early on, the family was advised to not be too outspoken and rely on the Foreign Office employing “quiet diplomacy” to secure her release. While the Iranians did not state this publicly, Nazanin’s arrest was linked to a 40-year unpaid debt of £400m, which the British Government reportedly owed Tehran for the non-delivery of a consignment of Chieftain tanks in the 1970s (a debt which Iranian media claims has this week finally been paid). But as those diplomatic channels led to endless dead ends, Richard took it upon himself to raise awareness of his wife’s plight and force the British Government into action.The  first interviewed him in May 2016 – 39 days after Nazanin had been due to return home. No one could have imagined then that their nightmare would still be ongoing some 70 months later.Last November, Richard, who grew up in Hampshire, conducted a 21-day hunger strike outside the Foreign Office, only bringing it to an end after supporters raised fears he was doing lasting damage to his health.Previously in 2019 he and Nazanin had embarked on co-ordinated hunger strikes his outside the Iranian Embassy in London, hers from her jail cell. The pair lasted 15 days without food. The years in prison have taken a terrible toll on Nazanin. Last year doctors from the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims, who assessed her condition remotely, concluded she had been subjected to bouts of torture, which had left her suffering from severe post traumatic stress disorder alongside a host of other medical conditions.During her imprisonment she was reportedly deliberately starved of sleep by her captors who left the lights blazing in her cell and television set blaring, while she was also blindfolded during lengthy interrogations. At times, she said her captors subjected her to psychological torture, warning her she would never see her daughter again and that she had been abandoned by her husband. She also suffered severe panic attacks. Last year, describing the 6ft by 5ft cell where she spent solitary confinement, she said: “The light was left on all the time. There was only a dirty mat on the floor with a thin blanket to sleep on. There were times I could not breathe.”While living with her grandparents in Tehran, Gabriella was able to visit her mother once a week in her prison cell. Such was her fragile mental state that even these sporadic visits Nazanin has previously credited with “saving her life”.But in April 2017, the family lost a case in Iran’s supreme court to have the sentence overturned. A few months later the then foreign secretary Boris Johnson made a diplomatic gaffe by apparently adding credence to the case against her by telling the Foreign Affairs Select Committee that his understanding was Nazanin was teaching journalism in Iran – something which was seized upon by the regime. Johnson later apologised to the family and admitted his comments “could have been clearer”.In August 2018, Nazanin was temporarily released from prison, but after enjoying just three days with Gabriella was returned to jail. Her daughter spent the next week crying for her mother at night, while soon afterwards Nazanin collapsed in her cell, stricken by the grief of being separated once more. In October 2019, however, the family made the decision for then five-year-old Gabriella to return to the UK alone, so she could be enrolled at a school near their north London home. “Nazanin and I always had a deal that she’d stay there until she turned school age,” Richard told The  at the time. But while he was elated to be reunited with his only child after three long years – “she ran to cuddle me. And squeezed hard” – he admitted that to have her return home without her mother was almost unbearable.Two years after her temporary release, Nazanin was given another glimpse of freedom in March 2020, and released for a second time over Iranian new year as part of emergency measures to curb spiralling rates of Covid, which had swept through Evin prison.With Gabriella already back in London at that point, Nazanin stayed with her parents in Tehran. Despite being forced to wear an ankle monitor restricting her to a 300m radius of their home, she was described by Richard – who was able to speak with her over regular Skype video calls – as being “euphoric” at being out of her cell. “It’s been so lovely to see her with a big grin on her face,” he told the . “She’s been catching up with lots of old friends… it’s so nice to see her doing those normal things, and feeling like a person again.”That house arrest was subsequently extended until a formal request for clemency could be considered. However in September 2020, Iran’s state media reported that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was once again due in court to face a new unspecified charge being brought against her. The following year she was sentenced to a further year in prison and banned from leaving the country for a year after that. Last October she lost her appeal against this second sentence, leading to fears she would once again be returned to her prison cell.The family’s ordeal has been made all the more unbearable by so many false dawns, but finally it appears that the campaign to secure her release has triumphed.At lunchtime today, Richard’s lawyer Penny Madden confirmed that Nazanin had boarded a plane to the UK – when she finally lands this evening, it will be the first time that Richard has seen his wife in person for almost six years. For her daughter, of course, there will be many more questions to come. But all that can wait – at last, her mummy is coming home.More from NewsNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe latest news: British aid worker lands in OmanVolodymyr Zelensky tells Joe Biden to \u0026#39be the leader of the free world\u0026#39 as he repeats no-fly zone pleaVladimir Medinsky: How Russia\u0026#39s former culture minister is now Putin\u0026#39s chief negotiator in Ukraine peace talks Politics latest news: Labour should ‘know better’ than to question Lord Lebedev peerage, says Dominic RaabSaharan dust storm shrouds Europe in orange glowMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"living polluted main road five years raises rheumatoid arthritis","story":"Long-term exposure to traffic and industrial air pollution raises the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis by 40 per cent, a study suggests.Italian researchers looked at the medical records of more than 80,000 people to see if there was a connection between their health and where they lived.They found that those who lived in an area of high pollution for five years were 12 to 13 per cent more likely to suffer from an autoimmune disease, such as multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBS).But certain conditions were more likely. The risk of connective tissue diseases was increased by 15 per cent, IBS by 20 per cent and rheumatoid arthritis by around 40 per cent.The team defined high pollution as fine particulate matter (PM2.5 above 20 micrograms per m3) or larger particles (PM10 above 30 micrograms per m3) - the equivalent of a busy inner-city road in Britain.PM2.5 pollution comes primarily from vehicle exhausts, power plants factories and burning wood, while PM10 is larger particles, which can come from smoke, dust and dirt from construction.“Iniduals chronically exposed to high levels of air pollution might be at risk of developing autoimmune diseases,” the authors concluded in the study published in the British Medical Journal.“The biological rationale supporting our results is strong.”Information on air quality was obtained from 617 monitoring stations in 110 Italian provinces. Medical records showed around 12 per cent of people had an autoimmune condition in the study. Around six per cent of people in Britain suffer from autoimmunity.The average long-term exposure between 2013 and 2019 was found to be 16 micrograms per m3 for PM2.5 and 25 micrograms per m3 for PM10.Although the study is observational, and the link cannot be proven, it is thought that emissions can cause the immune system to misfire, prompting inflammation through the body, tissue damage and eventually an autoimmune disease, where the body attacks itself.Air pollution has already been linked to immune system abnormalities, while smoking, which shares some toxins with fossil fuel emissions, doubles the risk of rheumatoid arthritis.Pollution has also been linked to other conditions including sight loss, dementia, depression, lung disease and heart problems.Commenting on the research, Prof Felicity Gavins, the director of The Centre for Inflammation Research and Translational Medicine, at Brunel University London, said: “This study further supports the mounting evidence suggesting a link between air pollution exposure and autoimmune diseases.“We know that autoimmune diseases are characterised by uncontrolled activation and dysregulation of the immune system.“Whether air pollution exposure specifically causes autoimmune diseases remains controversial, although there is no doubt that there is a link.”More from NewsPolitics latest news: Labour should ‘know better’ than to question Lord Lebedev peerage, says Dominic RaabNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe latest news: British aid worker lands in OmanVolodymyr Zelensky tells Joe Biden to \u0026#39be the leader of the free world\u0026#39 as he repeats no-fly zone pleaVladimir Medinsky: How Russia\u0026#39s former culture minister is now Putin\u0026#39s chief negotiator in Ukraine peace talks Saharan dust storm shrouds Europe in orange glowMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"saharan dust cloud shrouds europe orange glow","story":"Saharan dust has swept across southern England as residents awoke to orange skies on Wednesday.Sand whipped up by winds in the desert has been blown over Europe, reaching as far north as the southern part of the UK, lending an eerie orange tone to the sunlight.The dust particles sit about two kilometres above ground and filter out blue light from the sun, leading the light that does get through to have an orange tone.Met Office meteorologists said the sand would fall in rain forecast on Wednesday afternoon and evening, meaning cars and streets could end up coated with the orange dust. They added that there was no risk to public health.The phenomenon happens a few times a year in the UK and can cause poor air quality, but its convergence with the wet weather means it won’t affect pollution levels this time, the Met Office said.Meteorologists added that the dust often leads to dramatic, beautiful sunsets but these might not be visible on this occasion due to wet weather and heavy cloud cover.The dust is being pulled up across Europe by Storm Celia, named by the Portuguese Met Office, which is also affecting Spain.Richard Miles, of the Met Office, said: “We don’t expect significant impacts - the most likely would be on the cloudscapes at sunset, but as conditions are likely to be generally overcast and wet for much of the day this is unlikely to amount to much. There are no air quality warnings.“People in the south might find a bit of dust left on their cars as the rain washes it out of the skies today.”The orange sky is similar to the dramatic scenes seen in California in 2020 when a plume of wildfire smoke mostly blocked out the sun in the city of San Francisco, leading to a day when the sun appeared not to rise.Images from southern Europe on Wednesday showed a more dramatic orange colour to the sky, but in the UK the effect was more muted, peaking around lunchtime with the light taking on a muted amber tinge.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson insists \u0026#39things are changing\u0026#39 in Saudi Arabia as they execute threeVladimir Putin\u0026#39s army: The mercenaries and foreign troops forming second wave of fighters in UkraineWednesday evening UK news briefing: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe on her way home as UK repays £400mNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe latest news: British aid worker lands in OmanVolodymyr Zelensky tells Joe Biden to \u0026#39be the leader of the free world\u0026#39 as he repeats no-fly zone pleaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch bbc newsreader overwhelmed emotion announcing release","story":"A BBC newsreader became choked up with emotion as she announced Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u0027s release from Iran.News presenter Joanna Gosling apologised on-air after becoming teary-eyed while breaking the moving news that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is heading to Tehran airport and on her way home.The British-Iranian mother boarded a flight out of the country on Wednesday as the UK Government settled an outstanding £400 million debt owed to the regime in Tehran.Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s MP Tulip Siddiq broke the news yesterday morning (Weds) that her constituent’s six-year imprisonment in Iran was “finally” coming to an end.The British-Iranian mother is returning to Britain, along with a second dual national, Anoosheh Ashoori.While announcing the breaking story on BBC News, the broadcast journalist, 51, became visibly overcome with emotion and had to pause the announcement, saying: Sorry, this is a moving moment because these are people who have been detained for some time.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held for nearly six years in Iran and her husband has worked tirelessly to secure her release.Last October, husband Richard Ratcliffe began his second hunger strike in two years outside the Foreign Office in London due to the Government\u0027s inaction and failure in its handling of his wife\u0027s case.Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been in custody in Iran since 2016 after being accused of plotting to overthrow the government.She was taking her daughter Gabriella to see her family when she was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison shortly afterwards, spending four years in Evin Prison and one under house arrest.Victoria Coren Mitchell, who is a family neighbour and was a vocal advocate for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u0027s release, said the news was overwhelming.In a statement on Twitter, she added: All I want to say is that this is an inspirational family: the heroic Richard Ratcliffe, Nazanin and Gabriella, and their wider family in England, Wales and Iran, have a strength and bravery that is beyond words.They are showing the world the power of hope, faith and effort.Also Tulip Siddiq has been a phenomenal constituency MP. God bless all of them.Last March, Mr Ratcliffe and the pair\u0027s then six-year-old daughter Gabriella stood in protest outside Iran\u0027s London embassy, holding pictures and a sign that said help us free Nazanin.Boris Johnson, visiting Gulf states, welcomed news of the detainees\u0027 release.The UK has worked intensively to secure their release and I am delighted they will be reunited with their families and loved ones, he tweeted.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Labour should ‘know better’ than to question Lord Lebedev peerage, says Dominic RaabNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe latest news: British aid worker lands in OmanVolodymyr Zelensky tells Joe Biden to \u0026#39be the leader of the free world\u0026#39 as he repeats no-fly zone pleaVladimir Medinsky: How Russia\u0026#39s former culture minister is now Putin\u0026#39s chief negotiator in Ukraine peace talks Saharan dust storm shrouds Europe in orange glowMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain must keep searching way","story":"Britain must keep searching for way to persuade – or force – Putin to withdrawNo one knows how this will end but that is no reason for our Government and others not to keep searching for a way to persuade – or force – Putin to withdraw, says the Voice of the MirrorThis is a war about one man’s vile and foolish quest to build an empire in his honour Image: Sputnik AFP via Getty ImagesopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Mar |commentsSpeaking for good people of all faiths and none, the Pope’s plea to “stop this massacre” in Ukraine should make invader Vladimir Putin think again and withdraw. It should, but it probably won’t. What is becoming increasingly clear is that the slaughter of innocent civilians by Putin’s military forces guarantees the Kremlin killer will go down in history as a reviled leader who wrecked his own country to destroy another. Because many more will die in a terrible conflict that is all about one man’s vile and foolish quest to build an empire in his honour. The bloodshed is escalating as the war runs out of control, with missiles hitting a base near the Polish border and the fatal shooting of award-winning US filmmaker Brent Renaud. No one knows how this will end but that is no reason for our Government and others not to keep searching for a way to persuade – or force – Putin to withdraw.  Visas shame The great generosity of the British people towards Ukrainian refugees is far more inspiring than Conservative ministers who had to be dragged kicking and screaming every step of the way. It is absolutely shaming that just , visas have been issued when over . million desperate Ukrainians have fled Putin’s terror.  While the bureaucrats continue to put up obstacles, millions are prepared to open their homes to those seeking sanctuary here. The Refugee Council’s concern over the level of support for war victims and Labour’s accusations of foot-dragging reveal the truth about the £-a-month Homes for Ukraine offer. Those arriving require sympathy and help, and genuine fears need to be addressed.

But Deputy PM Dominic Raab failed to answer the question - instead angrily branding her claims “sheer nonsense”. Mr Johnson himself has insisted it is “simply incorrect” that he personally or directly asked for the advice to be reversed.  But writing on his paywalled Substack blog, Mr Cummings said he had been in the room when Cabinet Office officials informed Mr Johnson about the concerns. I supported these concerns and said to the PM in his study explicitly that he should not go ahead, he wrote. He was very cross and as he does when cross he blustered nonsense. ‘This is just … You’re just … [pause] ANTI-RUSSIAN!’ Mr Cummings went on to claim Mr Johnson had done his usual trick when I told him not to do something dumb and got a stooge to cut a deal with someone in the Cabinet Office. He added: There was a handful of people in the room who were part of this discussion at least two of who would agree with my version in court. I’m confident in predicting nobody would swear under oath the PM is telling the truth — including the PM!At PMQs, Mr Raab said: “All iniduals nominated for a peerage are done so in recognition of what their contribution is to society. “That includes those of Russian origin who contribute brilliantly to our nation, many of whom in this country are critics of the Putin regime. “Peerages are vetted by the House of Lords Appointments Commissionfor matters of probity and frankly she should know better.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyJohnsonsEvgeny LebedevBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The latest available data from the Department for Education shows % of children - or , pupils - had a reading ability below their expected ability at the end of Key Stage  in . The number of youngsters struggling at the end of primary school had increased, compared to % - or , pupils - the previous year. Official figures, revealed by Schools Minister Robin Walker in a written parliamentary question, show the figure rose to above % in some constituencies such as Leeds Central, Peterborough and Dudley North.Mr Walker said no data was recorded for academic years   or   due to the impact of the COVID- outbreak.The Liberal Democrats said the data laid bare the reading crisis in schools - and warned it could be the tip of the iceberg after children suffered major disruption to their schooling during the pandemic. MPs warned last week that poorer pupils could be up to eight months behind at school after the pandemic and the Governmentaposs catch-up plans are failing to reach them.The Commons Education Committee said repeated school closures had a disastrous impact on childrenaposs education, with disadvantaged kids worst hit by months out of the classroom. Lib Dem education spokesperson Munira Wilson said: These figures reveal a reading crisis in our schools and they’re just the tip of the iceberg. The pandemic has had a huge effect on our children, and with reading ages already below standards for many before the crisis, the case now could be terrible for thousands of children across the country.  “Parents, teachers and pupils have not had a fair deal throughout this pandemic, no child should leave primary school unable to read at the standard level for their age - they need a chance to catch up. The party called for an urgent review into reading standards across the country and for ministers to pump more cash into catch-up programmes. The Government has announced £ billion in funding to help children catch up on lost learning over the pandemic - which has been criticised for falling short of the £ billion demanded by Boris Johnsonaposs education recovery tsar Sir Kevan Collins. A Department for Education spokesperson said: We are committed to raising literacy standards and our ambitious recovery plan is helping pupils make up for learning lost during the pandemic. Backed by £ billion, we are rolling out high-quality tutoring – which has seen a million courses started by pupils so far – alongside world class training for teachers and early years practitioners, and additional funding for schools.

Boris Johnson said: “We’re taking steps to mitigate that to help people with the cost of living.” Yet Chancellor Rishi Sunak is understood to be strongly resisting bids to cut fuel duty, give more help for bills, or raise benefits or pensions by the same amount as inflation.So when and what is the Spring Statement, and what do we know about how it’s shaping up  Here’s what you need to know.When is the Spring Statement  Chancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver the  Spring Statement on Wednesday  March at .pm. He will give a speech in the Commons, followed by documents and forecasts published online. After complaints from the Speaker, less of his statement is expected to be ‘trailed’ in advance. But the Chancellor is set to appear on Sunday morning TV this weekend to give a preview. What is the Spring Statement The Spring Statement is a ‘mini-Budget’ by the Chancellor on the situation facing the economy.It is lower-key than a Budget and does not contain the same tax and spending powers.For instance, fuel duty and taxes on cigarettes and alcohol were already set for the year in October’s Budget. So was the minimum wage rise from £. to £. in April - though you can expect Mr Sunak to crow about it anyway.What will Chancellor Rishi Sunak announce during the Spring Statement The Chancellor is expected to lay out the sheer scale of the cost-of-living disaster hitting poor Brits. This will be in the form of Office for Budget Responsibilityforecasts on GDP growth, borrowing, debt and inflation. They will also have the warm-up acts of the Bank of England’s interest rates decision tomorrow, and monthly inflation figures for February - which will be published at am on the day of the Spring Statement. While growth is rising post-Covid, so is inflation - and it is set to be much worse than the last forecast . All this will ramp up pressure to announce extra help for households - but he’s reluctant to do that. Soaring inflation looks set to push up his borrowing bill, reducing the amount he claims he can spend. He could recycle already-announced policies or announce vague ‘consultations’ on future ones, but will it be enough  UK inflation could rise over % Shock analysis last week found inflation is set to peak at .% in April after the Ukraine invasion made it even worse.The Mirror understands Whitehall officials believe this figure, calculated by the Resolution Foundation, is broadly accurate. Officials in fact fear it could go even higher, beating the .% rate of  and even hitting %. This will blow October’s forecasts - that inflation would peak at .% this year and could rise to .% - out of the water. It will mean more expensive food and goods in the shops, hitting the poorest families hardest.Will there be help with energy bills Rishi Sunak is reluctant to offer extra help on energy bills - despite soaring prices and mounting pressure from MPs and charities. Previously he announced a £ council tax discount for Bands A-D next month, and a £ repayable rebate in October. Yet bills are rising by £ a year on April  and will rise again in October - possibly by another £, a year. This is a far bigger hit to the poorest tenth of households who spend around % of their income on energy. The richest spend %. Treasury officials want to wait until the run-up to the October rise before announcing more help. But a former Treasury minister told the Mirror that approach is “not going to work”, adding: “He’s going to have to do something, it just can’t be the full Covid.” Laura Suter, head of personal finance at AJ Bell, speculated that ministers might raise the £ repayable bills discount in October, or put back the start of repayments, currently April .But Mr Sunak has rejected Labour’s calls to cut VAT on energy bills or impose a windfall tax. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: Millions of people are worried sick about soaring bills. Meanwhile, BP have said theyaposve got more cash than they know what to do with, and have compared their record profits from inflated prices to a cash machine.” A long-term energy supply planBoris Johnson will set out a long-term energy supply plan for the UK to wean off Russian oilby the end of the year. This is expected to invest more in renewable power and nuclear power, as well as trying to get more oil from places like Saudi. But it’s not directly connected to the Spring Statement and could be published on a dferent day next week.Will benefits and pensions rise in April Despite gloom-laden inflation predictions, Mr Sunak will raise benefits by just .% - as little as £. a month on Universal Credit. In October he cut Universal Credit for millions by £ a week. Pensions will also rise by just .% after the triple lock was axed. These are both real-terms cuts that will leave the poorest struggling more.In a Budget rabbit out of the hat in October, he handed more generous benefits to .million working families by cutting the Universal Credit taper rate from p to p. But this only helps those who work, not the sick or out-of-work.The Resolution Foundation is worried there will be a “rollercoaster” with real benefits down this year and up next year. Tory MP Nigel Mills suggested bringing forward next yearaposs increase in Universal Credit to this autumn to solve the problem. The Mirror understands Mr Sunak is unlikely to raise benefits by more than .% because of the multi-billion pound cost - and the need to raise pensions and pay at the same timehe does. Will there be a pay rise for nurses, teachers and other public sector workers from April  Inflation means planned rises to public sector wages - due every April - will be wiped out by prices. Rising prices put huge pressure on the Chancellor to give these vital key workers pay rises above % or %, to avoid hitting them with a real-terms cut. But the Treasury is resisting such big cash rises. The government has spelt out plans to raise salaries for experienced teachers by only % in  .Health unions have also blasted plans to offer NHS staff in England a “miserly” % hike.Pressure on the Chancellor to reverse this will be huge but again, it will take a lot for him to budge. Will fuel duty be cut Fuel duty was already frozen at October’s Budget for a th year in a row - handing £, to the average car driver since . Despite environmental fears, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is being pressed to go even further and actually cut it. One idea from a Tory MP is to give a % cut to vital fuel users, such as haulage firms. But it’s understood the Chancellor resists this idea, because it would not make a huge dference to the overall cost of a tank. Not compared to the huge rises coming from inflation and the war in Ukraine, anyway.Will National Insurance and other tax rises be cancelled National Insurance will rise from % to .% from April . Tory MPs are still pushing for this to be cancelled as it’s a major tax rise just as a cost-of-living crisis hits. Downing Street say the rise is going ahead, despite previous claims Boris Johnson was wobbling. But some Tories still hold out hope. One said: “If itaposs about pride, they can now say that Ukraine is the reason they need to change course. Meanwhile more than  MPs have backed a bid from left-wing MP Richard Burgon to replace the hike with a wealth tax on the richest %. He says the same amount of income could be raised with a .% tax on wealth above £m. There are other tax squeezes - the Income Tax personal allowance and p rate threshold will freeze at £, and £,. And the VAT rate for hospitality firms, currently .% due to Covid, is due toto %. There are spaces here for the Chancellor to act but it would scupper his claims to be recovering from Covid.A vision beyond Covid and the war The Chancellor will likely try to set out a world beyond Covid but the Ukraine war and soaring inflation will make this dficult. Expect many references to infrastructure and ‘levelling-up’ but be on the lookout for old pots of money being reannounced. One Tory admitted to the Mirror: “The Rachel Reeves line that weaposre a high tax, low growth Government is true at the moment. “We donapost seem to have many pro-growth policies, weaposve pretty much given up on supply-side reforms.

Days later, he oversaw the largest mass execution in the country’s history. He is betting countries like the UK will look away, because they would rather fund his blood-soaked petro-state than Putin’s war machine. It is not an either or. There are better and more sustainable ways to deal with the energy crisis than empowering these regimes. By visiting Saudi Arabia, Johnson will confirm that the Kingdom will face no meaningful consequences for this mass execution. It virtually guarantees more people whose only crime was to protest against Bin Salman’s rule will be executed. People like Hassan al Maliki, an academic currently facing a death sentence for owning banned books.  The  executions at the weekend were probably beheadings, but Saudi ‘justice’ is such a black box we can’t be sure. The European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, which tracks death sentences in Saudi Arabia, didn’t even know about  of the cases. These men were tried, convicted, sentenced and executed in complete secrecy.Of the  we do know about, at least three were tortured into making  confessions to terrorism offences after taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations. Aqil al-Faraj was held in solitary confinement, beaten all over his body and tortured with electricity and cigarette burns. He was imprisoned for five years, without access to a lawyer, before trial. This is the reality of Saudi capital punishment. The authorities label executed men ‘terrorists’ but there are political prisoners, non-violent drug offenders, and people arrested as children on death row. In , the UK and Saudi governments signed a top secret ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ on judicial co-operation. Since this agreement has been in place, the Saudi regime led by King Salman and his son has dramatically increased the pace of executions – there have been more than  in all. Ministers claim the UK is a restraining influence, but the Saudis don’t seem to have noticed.Visiting Riyadh so soon after this mass execution shames the Prime Minister and shames Britain. We must not show our revulsion for Vladimir Putin’s atrocities by rewarding those of Mohammed Bin Salman.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON King SalmanBoris JohnsonVladimir PutinTerrorismHuman rightsPoliticsRussia Ukraine warDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Courtney Rogers, , from New Mexico in the US, and her pastor husband Chris, , welcomed lb oz Cambria into the world on  March, bringing their total kids to the magic number . The parents say they never intended to have so many kids when they first decided to start a family, and even suffered a miscarriage when they first started trying - but now their brood is perfect. Their eldest son, Clint, was born on  March  before the couple went on to have another five boys, followed by six girls. It is amazing how it worked out too because we had all our boys at the beginning and the last five have been girls, so it all evened out, Courtney said.  Clint was born three weeks before I turned  but, back then, I had no clue that I would have more children. I thought I was too old at  and I didnapost know they would come so fast, plus include a set of twins. Then we said we would have  children maximum, but I still felt young and healthy enough, so we pushed it to . Clint, , Clay, , Cade, nine, Callie, eight, Cash, seven, twins Colt and Case, six, Calena, four, Caydie, three, Coralee, two, Caris, one, and now newborn baby Cambria. Asthe kids werenapost enough to run around after, they also live on a farm with more than  animals including pigs, sheep and chickens. The family is now relieved to have little Cambria home after she spent the first few days of her le on oxygen after being delivered via C-section.  The tot swallowed too much fluid and had to be monitored for several days. While Courtney and Chris had an agonising wait for news on Cambriaaposs condition they were reminded of the frightening birth of their second-youngest, Caris, who was delivered via emergency C-section when doctors feared she wasnapost getting enough oxygen. Now with  children aged  and under, Courtney and Chris are getting stuck into family planning to manage the bunch. Since first becoming a mum  years ago, the longest Courtney has gone without being pregnant is seven months. The biggest gap between two of the children is  months, during which time Courtney sadly had a miscarriage. She said: It is going to be strange not to have another baby. Pregnancy mostly treated me well, I didnapost get sick and was never on bedrest, so I could always look after the kids. I have enjoyed having babies. While managing so many kids, Courtney can spot their little personalities coming out as they get older. She said: The little girls know they are the youngest because they try to get away with everything. Without any more kids planned, the parents are now turning their attention to some home improvements - including an extension on their four-bedroom house to create seven bedrooms. It will also give Courtney more time to focus on the weekly shop, which includes  disposable nappies , six loaves of bread and  gallons of milk. Courtney says the kids, who are homeschooled, are all incredibly close and like to pal up with each other. She said: We do everything together. We work together and do home-schooling together. When they are younger I help the children with all their schooling, but when they are older - from the age of  - we switch to online tuition.  A typical day in the Rogers household involves breakfast at am, before lessons in maths and art. Lunch tends to be around .am-pm when Courtney will feed the little ones sandwiches and put them down for a nap, while the older kids make their own food. In the afternoon, the kids have an assortment of language classes, arts, and reading time, with Zoom piano lessons thrown in once in a while. Dinner is served at pm which is usually a meal that has been batch-cooked by Courtney, such as spaghetti or homemade pancakes. A typical mealtime will see the family get through  eggs, while a whole box of cereal is used up at breakfast every day. In between teaching the kids, Courtney also takes responsibility for keeping the house tidy, before she puts them down to bed at .pm.  Courtney documents her family le on her Instagram page, @littlehouseinthehighdesert, where she has nearly , followers.However, having such a big  has opened her up to some nasty trolling from people who object to her having so many children. She said: People we know donapost say anything to our faces, but there are always those on the internet who have something mean to say. She added: I do find it hard sometimes, as most people think we are crazy for having so many, but I have several friends on the internet with big families. I am content right now, but I am sure I will miss the baby stage, although I think Chris might have something to sayI get broody again.Do you have a large family  We pay for stories.

As part of the show, he explained to viewers how they could receive cash by taking advantage of marriage tax allowance.Martin explained that the marriage tax allowance allows you to transfer £, of your personal allowanceto your spouse or civil partner,they earn more than you. One viewer investigatedshe could benefit from this advice and made a phone call which ended up with her receiving an £ windfall.  She tweeted to Martin: After watching your programme last night on marriage allowance, I rang up today and £ cheque is in the post … thank you for all that you do, we are lucky to have someone like you. What is the marriage allowance  The marriage allowance allows you to transfer £, of your personal allowanceto your spouse or civil partner,they earn more than you.If your claim is successful, it will lower the higher earneraposs tax bill for the tax year, but you can also backdate your claimeligible. Only people with specic circumstances will be able to apply, says WalesOnline. You need to be married or in a civil partnership, not just living together. One of you needs to be a non-taxpayer, which usually means youaposll earn less than the £, personal allowance between April ,  and April , . The other partner needs to be a basic % rate taxpayer and you both must have been born on or after April , . If that like you, get on the phone and you could be quids in.

A turning point came for the couple in October , shortly after a triumphant -day tour of South Africa, when ITVaposs Tom Bradby asked Meghanshe was coping with the pressures. A visibly stressed Meghan replied: It’s not enough to just survive something, that’s not the point of le. I tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stf upper lip. I tried, I really tried, but I think that what that does internally is probably really damaging.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here But Royal correspondent and author Katie Nicholl said the coupleaposs determination to go it alone is proof of their love and solidarity as a couple. The couple spoke about the pressures of working as full-time royals in a tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey last year. The highly anticipated interview saw the couple lt the lid on le behind Palace walls and make several shocking allegations about their family.  They shared that there had been concerns over the colour of their son Archieaposs skin and said Prince Charles had stopped taking Harryaposs phone calls. They also revealed they secretly got married before their royal wedding, and that they are expecting a daughter in the summer. Katie told OK!: “In only four years they’ve been on an extraordinary journey, making such huge decisions. But as Harry said, they are in it together, as a team,” adds Katie. “When you think about what they’ve turned their backs on, what they’ve given up and particularly the sacrices Harry has made, it’s just as well they’re such a strong unit because they’ve only really got each other. Meghan’s only family connections are with her mother Doria, and Harry’s ties with his family are hanging by a thread.” Royal author Nigel Cawthorne agreed, saying Harry and Meghanaposs solitude may have strengthened them as a couple.  “It’s Harry and Meghan against the world or them against the British establishment,” he said. “But when couples go through a shared problem, it does tend to make them stronger.” While many believe the key to any reconciliation with the royals could lie in their children Archie and baby Lilibet, born in June last year, that still seems a way off for now. Faced with a choice between love and duty, Harry and Meghan resoundingly chose love.

Harley and Harry were conceived through IVF and were born at just  weeks and five days.Parents Jade and Steve Crane had been warned by doctors it could be a miscarriage as the tiny tots were so young, telling them to “prepare to say goodbye”.But when they were born they showed signs of le so the team burst into action.Now, after  days of intensive care, the brother and sister have been allowed to go home, the Liverpool Echo reports.Former mental health nurse Jade said: Iaposm so proud of my babies - theyaposre little fighters. “Theyaposre doing absolutely amazing. Theyaposre doing all the things that we were told they wouldnapost do - theyaposre crying, theyaposre surviving.  The doctors were saying the babies wouldnapost survive at this gestation. I was still two weeks away from what the UK classes as viable and the babies were given a zero per cent chance of survival. “It was only because I was at a teaching hospital and that the babies were born with signs of le that they chose to intervene medically.”The couple underwent eight cycles of IVF over  years as they tried to start their family, tragically suffering three miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy before the twins’ arrival.Jade discovered she had an overactive immune system, causing her body to reject the pregnancies before the couple moved from a fertility clinic in Nottingham to one on Harley Street in London.Jade was prescribed several types of medication in order to combat her immune system problems. Jade added: On our eighth cycle of IVF, we had two embryos transferred which both worked and we ended up with boy and girl twins. “I couldnapost let myself believe it, I was so fearful of a miscarriage or something going wrong. I was still in disbelief when we got to  weeks, and I hadnapost even hit my third trimester when I went into labour so we hadnapost bought anything. “The few bits of clothes that I did buy made me think that I better keep the tags on just in case - you just donapost want to let yourself believe. The couple checked in at Queens Medical Hospital in Nottingham on October  when Jade leaked fluid at home for several days at  weeks.  The babies were not considered to be viable and the poor mum believed she would lose her precious twins. She added: The doctor kept saying it was a miscarriage but I said it couldnapost be because I could feel the babies moving. I knew they were ok but was being told they wouldnapost survive at this gestation. It was only because the babies were born with signs of le that they chose to intervene medically. They were alive, moving around, and they cried. Their little cries sounded like a tiny kitten.” The tiny children were finally allowed home on Monday- just two weeks after their initial due date. Steve added: The absolutely stunning doctors, nurses and surgeons have all been part of the making of this moment. “Itaposs hard to say goodbye to them but I hope I never see them again.

Later, Laura stepped in to be a surrogate mum for EmmaEmma Smuts-Muller and her best friend Laura DonohoeByNatasha Wynarczyk:,  Mar |commentsOver the course of their -year friendship, Emma Smuts-Muller and Laura Donohoe have been there for each other through thick and thin.But now the pair share an even more special bond, after caring Laura stepped in to be a surrogate mother for her best friend - after being bridesmaid for her just months earlier. Emma saw her hopes of conceiving dashed after she was diagnosed with breast cancer in September  and had to undergo treatment which affected her fertility.But thanks to Laura, Emma is now the proud mum of miracle baby Ella and is looking forward to a bright future.“Laura and I have always had an amazing connection with each other since we met at school,” says -year-old Emma, who lives near Birmingham and works as a chief of staff for West Midlands Police. “My husband Thomas and I had realised just how ready we were to have a baby, but after having breast cancer that decision was taken away from us. I will never be able to repay Laura for what she’s done for my family and it’s brought us even closer together.” In May , Emma married Thomas, , with Laura, , by their side as a bridesmaid. Soon after ing from their honeymoon in Lake Como, Emma was delighted to discover that she was pregnant, but tragically miscarried just eight weeks later. The couple were dealt another blow when Emma’s father Terry was diagnosed with leukaemia, then, that September Emma found a mass in her right breast. Scans quickly confirmed the diagnosis of breast cancer.  “I’d had some soreness that I’d initially put down to being pregnant, but when I noticed the changes in my breast I had an instant gut feeling that it was something bad,” Emma recalls. “Thomas and I had been on a massive high after the wedding, and to get pregnant so quickly it felt like everything was going to plan, but to be dealt so many devastating problems one after the other was really dficult for our family. “I just felt myself go into fight mode. I tried to not think too far into the future because it would have been too overwhelming. I knew I had no option but to get on with le.” Emma underwent eight cycles of chemotherapy which started in November . The following April, Emma had a mastectomy which removed her right breast as well as the cm cancerous tumour, then she went on to have two weeks of radiotherapy. Desperate to become a parent, Emma had been told by doctors that the chemotherapy could affect her fertility so she’d been offered IVF before starting her cancer treatment. However, despite successfully freezing  embryos it became clear that it wouldn’t be an option for Emma to carry one of them herself.  Emma says: “Because my breast cancer was linked to hormones, I had oian supression treatment. I was also told I need to take tamoxen - which I am on for  years - to stop the cancer ing. Due to the previous treatment, and the fact tamoxen stops your oies working, I began to go into the menopause. “Doctors also don’t allow you to get pregnant on tamoxen, and due to my age, I would have potentially been too old to carry my own child once I stopped taking the medication.” Emma and Thomas began to explore the possibility of using a surrogate to conceive, then one night Laura, who has two daughters aged seven and  with her husband Rob, came over to their house and told them she would be willing to carry their child. “She just dropped it out there that she would consider being our surrogate, which took us both massively by surprise,” says Emma.“However, due to the coronavirus pandemic the plans were put on hold for a few months, and despite having such a long time to mull it over she didn’t change her mind. I was so grateful to her.”In February , Laura was implanted with one of Emma and Thomas’s embryos. The trio then had a nail-biting two-week wait until Laura could do a pregnancy test.“When she sent the picture of the positive test through, we were so shocked - but really delighted,” says Emma. “We did this part of the fertility treatment with a private clinic but the doctors there told us there was only a % chance of it working due partly to my age and us using a surrogate, so I had prepared for the worst.” On November , Ella was born with Emma by Laura’s side as she went through labour. “Ella was  days overdue, so she did keep us waiting - however, she was definitely worth the wait,” says Emma. “Laura was very clear with her own children that she was just helping myself and Thomas out, and they really understood that. “I never had any worries that Laura would bond with Ella and find it dficult to give her over to us. “We don’t know yet when we will tell Ella how she was born, but it’s such a positive experience however we describe it. Most of all, we want her to understand what a miracle she is.” Now, Emma will have a yearly mammogram and speaks to her oncologist every six weeks to make sure the cancer hasn’t ed. Most of all, she is enjoying being a mum. She adds: “After coming through such a dficult time, Thomas and I finally have something positive to focus on. Laura is an incredible human being for carrying Ella for us.” Breast Cancer Now support and fund research into the condition.

It was a surprising diagnosis and we were trying to figure out what could be done for her situation. She continued: We came across a group in Scunthorpe which initially did dance and drama for children with learning dficulties but then it became a modelling agency and we wanted to try it for a bit of fun. She was on their books and we went done to London for her first shoot with the clothing company, Boden and she ended up in their catalogue which was amazing.

Looking further ahead, it could be a hot spring with weather forecaster Jim Dale reportedly saying that it could get up to C by the middle of April. And bookies are cutting the odds on it being the hottest spring on record. With temperatures on the up, Ladbrokes have slashed odds in half from   to just   on this going down as the hottest spring ever.  Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: Spring is just around the corner and as things stand weaposre well on course for a record-breaking scorcher,the latest odds are anything to go by.”For this week it will be quite pleasant said BBC Weatheraposs Tomasz Schafernaker with sunshine and dry weather.“In the south where the winds will be light the temperatures will be around the mid-teens. Then Thursday and Friday the high pressure establishes itself across the UK, in fact a big high pressure spreading all the way from Eastern Europe to the edge of Ireland so a lot of settled weather, said Mr Schafernaker. You can see the winds blowing around the high here. Northern and western parts of the country right in the middle of that high where the weather will be sunniest, the winds will be lightest and as a result will have the highest temperatures around C or C.  And that high pressure is expected to persist Friday, Saturday and into Sunday as well although it will be a little breezy at times. Mr Schafernaker continued: Highest temperatures will be C for example Liverpool but on the coast of Cornwall and Devon it could only be about C. Then Saturday into Sunday that high pressure still with us. The winds will change direction a little around the high, they will be coming more out of the south and south east that generally means a lot of dry weather, fairly decent temperatures. UK forecast for the next  days Wet for many today but sunnier on Thursday. Today: Cloudy for most of England, Wales and eastern Scotland rain at times, becoming heavier and more widespread later for central and eastern England. Brighter in northwest UK with some showers, brighter weather edging into other northern and western areas later. Tonight: Rain in eastern England clearing, then many areas turning clear and cold, with patchy frost and some rural mist. Showers in northwest UK easing, but turning wetter and windier later. Thursday: Many areas starting chilly, fine conditions lasting most of Thursday in southern and eastern England. Rain and brisk winds in the northwest spreading to central areas, followed by blustery showers Outlook for Friday to Sunday: Showers in the far north clear early Friday. Some night frost and fog where, but then all areas dry and increasingly sunny. Perhaps cloudier with a few showers Sunday.

Speaking about her experience, Abbey said: I got admitted for the kidney infection because I needed an intravenous drip and they kept me in for some more tests. But on one of the rounds of testing there was a bit of miscommunication - but it worked in my favour. The doctors asked meit hurt anywhere and I said it hurt to breathe, but I was referring to my kidney - he thought I meant my chest. They sent for further CT scans on my chest and found the aneurysmon my heart. I was there for  days, my mouth was full of ulcers and I had a lump under my armpit, which turned out to be an aneurysm as well.  Itaposs such a rare disease, normally no one would think about it being that. It was my second kidney infection in such a short period of time so I think that was a bit of a red flag. Boyfriend Jack Bates, , admitted he thinks without the shock diagnosis his girlfriend wouldnapost have made it to Christmas. The electrician has since decided to raise money for Dr Bergaposs research department with a three peaks challenge. He added: Her condition is a lot to take in some days, having to take some time off work to look after her, but it’s scary. The fundraiser is something I’d been wanting to do for a while, to try and raise money for Dr Berg’s research department and Behcetaposs UK as well. Without Dr Berg’s diagnosis in November , Christmas  would have been Abbey’s last. After receiving her diagnosis Abbey was placed on chemotherapy and steroid treatments to prevent the inflammation and will need heart surgery on a mm split which is leaking fluid. The -year-old hopes to be a mum one day and in an attempt to prevent the disease affecting her fertility she is having injections in an attempt to save her eggs. She added: I didn’t realise how serious it was, which was a good thing, but also when they came in to say I had to start chemotherapy and might not be able to have children, it was quite scary. I just thought I had a kidney infection but then they started talking about heart surgery and all this, it’s still strange now.  If I didn’t go in, they thought I was going to die, so it’s a good thing that I got a diagnosis. I’m not religious or anything like that but I do think someone was looking out for me, to go in with a kidney infection and come out with this. I had to leave my job because they said I couldn’t work for  weeks, which is almost a whole year, what was I supposed to do  I think also having an additional barrier of maybe not having children, I meant to be in the prime of my le. She admitted to feeling relieved to know the reason for her symptoms. Abbey added: To finally know what was causing my symptoms, I didn’t want to be in pain all the time, it was such a nice feeling to know that I wasn’t making it up. It was a relief, but it’s a shame that the treatment is so intense. It is for le and it is intense. I struggle to even walk my dog because of my chest pain. I had to get an ambulance last week because I honestly thought my aneurysm had ruptured, and I’ve never been so scared in my le. I really thought that it had ruptured and I was  and dead. It was so scary. Behcetaposs is an incurable form of vasculitis with ying symptoms, and with little research surrounding the illness, it is dficult to receive a diagnosis.

While some owners seek inspiration from their favourite books, television shows and movies, others opt for a name with a more apospersonal meaningapos behind it.But one dog owner has begun to question whether she was in the wrong after naming her dog in honour of her late mum. Having been branded as disrespectful by her close friends and family, the -year-old has taken to Reddit to explain her unusual situation.to ourTeamDogs newsletterfor your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. She said: My husband and I recently rescued a new dog and named her Penelope in honour of my mother who passed away last year. My family has said they think that is very weird and disrespectful. They saidI wanted to honour her, I should have taken my motheraposs cat when she passed instead of asking my brother to. Questioning why her dogaposs name has caused such a commotion within her family, the woman has been seeking the opinions of other dog owners. One user said: You are allowed to name your dog whatever you want. Your family is allowed to be uncomfortable with you naming a dog after their recently dead family member.  In agreement, another added: It’s not weird or disrespectful. My dad named two dogs, at separate times, after his late brother. People find comfort in it and your family is a bit weird for being so upset about it. However, others sided with the womanaposs family agreeing it is strange to name a pet after a late loved one. One user said: I wouldn’t want to connect my late mother and your dog either. You can and have named your dog whatever you want but claiming a name that matters to other people then includes the feelings of other people.

I probably would’ve assumed it was just a balloon or something. “But the fact that it appeared to be completely still was what prompted me to record it.”He continued: “I still have no idea what it could’ve been. “If you use your imagination a bit, it almost appears humanoid, maybe even angelic. I wish I had a phone with a really good zoom to be honest. “I’d be interested to hear what an expert would have to say. “Realistically, it’s probably a trick of the light, but it’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before.” Sharing his footage online, Matthew soon discovered that he wasn’t alone in what he saw. “The most intriguing responses were the couple of people who claimed to have seen something very similar,” he said. “One person said they’d seen it that very same morning where in Scotland.” Mr Gowans kept his eyes on the mysterious presence for a couple of minutes, before looking away for a few seconds to check some of the footage he’d recorded. By the time he’d lted his eyes again, it was gone. “I’m disappointed I didn’t keep an eye on it for longer,” he said. And while some viewers have offered totally ordinary explanations for what he saw, its true nature remains a mystery.  Matthew said: “There were some definitive claims made about it, but the range of those claims proves it’s not cut and dry.“One person said it’s obviously a cloud, one person said it’s obviously a weather balloon, one person said it’s obviously a plane, and so forth.“Personally I don’t think it’s any of those things.” And when it comes to the extraterrestrial, Mr Gowans takes a nuanced view. He said: “Certainly there’s other intelligent le in space. People that believe otherwise sort of baffle me. I mean, the sheer size of the universe… “But, given that sheer size, I think the chances that aliens have made it all the way to Earth – or even been made aware of us – are slim. “There’s so many sightings these days, though, and that NASA investigation a while back was interesting – so many Navy pilots have recounted seemingly credible encounters.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NasaUFOs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jordan Mapes posted the picture of the cups online, where they sat alongside a note that explained how people could choose the cup that was right for them.The cups each had words printed on the front including strategy, articial intelligence, innovation, and leadership, and attendees were told to pick a cup based on what they wanted to talk to others about. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Alongside the cups, a note read: Pick a cup based on what you would like to discuss most. This will help everyone to network with like-minded people.Jordan, who posts on Twitter under the username @jordanmapes, then kicked off a debate around the idea of the cups, as she said she would simply not drink coffeeit meant she had to socialise at the same time.Many others took a similar stance, with thousands replying to the tweet to share their distaste for mingling at business meetings - especially when itaposs forced through the use of coffee cups. One person said: I would drink it from my cupped hands rather than go through this torture.  While another added: Nightmares from my days in marketing. And a third said: Strategy is literally my job and even I wouldnapost want this. Others jokingly shared what they would write on their own cups instead, with answers including dinosaurs, Fight Club, and memes. Someone tweeted: This is why I carry a Sharpie with me at all times. Iaposd have to put aposLeave me the f**k aloneapos. As someone  added: Just bring a sharpie with you, cross out whatever it says on your preferred colour of cup, and write aposcatsapos instead. But some were in favour of the idea, as one person pointed out the cups could actually be useful in the right setting, providing everyone involved actually wants to socialise. They said: I actually kinda like the idea, assuming that this is happening at some kind of conference or event where people came specically to discuss this kind of thing, as opposed to the cups being handed out to random people in the street or something. And another agreed, writing: This is dumb but % a genius event idea. Theyaposre always looking for ways to start conversations. Evenitaposs stupid it still works because people can laugh about it and still talk.

Waiting for your opinions!” she told members of the Cleaning  Organising Inspiration Australia group.

It was believed the mass may have collided with Earth off the coast of Iceland. According to IFL Science reports, the asteroid was special in that astronomers only noticed it two hours before it made contact with Earth. This makes it only the fth asteroid that had been spotted before potentially hitting the planet. It was currently unclear as to whether the asteroid actually hit the water or broke up in the atmosphere.Local reports from Iceland stated that there was a large fireball overhead, while the near-earth objects coordination centre at theEuropean Space Agency was now appealing for any footage of the asteroid. They note that this was unlikely, due to the remoteness of the location. The sighting was made at a Hungarian observatory by Krisztián Sárneczky, who pointed out a “bright and fast-moving object” in the night sky. The object was named Sar and was initially deemed to have an impact likelihood of less than  percent. However, automatic systems later picked up that Sar in fact had an impact chance of  per cent and would land somewhere near Northern Ireland. Astronomers from all over the world cottoned on and quickly began attempting to monitor the object - no easy feet when it was travelling at . kilometresper second and flying so close to Earth. The object was estimated to have impacted Earth at some point between . and .pm UTC, assuming it made it through the atmosphere before burning up. There was currently no concrete evidence to suggest it did touch down, though there had been indications of a large impact off the coast of Iceland that may be connected. Signals were picked up by both Iceland and Greenland, originating from an impact with an energy release of around  to  kilotons of TNT.  This was considered an indication an asteroid of around  to  metres in diameter had hit the ocean nearby. The asteroid would have broken down and vaporised in parts as it scorched through the atmosphere at that speed. This breakdown was often seen as large flashes of light, often called a fireball, which occurred as friction with eth air breaks the asteroid apart.Anyone who may have spotted the asteroid and have footage, was being asked to submit it to the ESAhere .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Asteroids\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Challenges like the terrain, and transport issues have severely hampered Moscow’s ability to advance across what is the biggest European country by landmass. On top of that, an inability to secure control of the sky has “drastically limited” their ability to utilise jets and limited their options further. On top of that, the military acumen of the Ukrainian forces and the tactics they have used have exploited Russian weakness and inflicted “heavy losses” on Putin’s invading forces.Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here In a statement released on Twitter, they said: “Russian forces are struggling to overcome the challenges posed by Ukraine’s terrain.“They have remained largely tied to Ukraine’s road network and have demonstrated a reluctance to conduct off-road manoeuvres.“The destruction of bridges by Ukrainian forces has also played a key role in stalling Russia ’s advance.“Russia’s continued failure to gain control of the air has drastically limited their ability to effectively use air manoeuvres, further limiting their options.  “The tactics of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have adeptly exploited Russia’s lack of manoeuvre, frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on invading forces.” This comes as one of Putinaposs closest allies has admitted Russiaaposs invasion of Ukraine have not gone to plan. Viktor Zolotov, chief of Russiaaposs national guard and apart of Putinaposs security council, said progress of the invasion had been slower than expected. He said: I would like to say that yes, not everything is going as fast as we would like, Zolotov said in comments posted on the National Guardaposs website. But we are going towards our goal step by step and victory will be for us.  Zolotov has been at Putinaposs side since before the turn of the century and has spent the last  years in charge of his personal security. His comments, made at a church service led by Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on Sunday, have reflected reports from Western intelligence and mark a departure from official Kremlin lines so far. This comes as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine comes to the end of its third week. In that time, Russia has lost four major generals and nearly a dozen high-ranking officers. It has sustained heavier casualties than Ukraine, and lost more tanks than Germany has in its army.  It was reported, Russia initially planned a ‘lightning invasion’ that would have seen Putin’s forces sweep the country and take Kyiv in a matter of days. However, now the Kremlin finds itself in protracted warfare against Ukraine’s forces and negotiating with the government it hoped to oust. Russia’s invasion has reportedly been plagued with issues such as low morale and supply issues. A number of videos have circulated on social media, showing Russian vehicles running out of fuel. Russia has maintained the invasion is going to plan, but reports from US intelligence officials have said they have been asking China for military equipment since the beginning of the invasion.  After initial failures to conquer Ukraineaposs cities, Russia has turned to relentless shelling and bombing of civilian targets. The deadly invasion has led to thousands of deaths and has led to over three million refugees having fled from their homes since February . The United Nations High Commission for Refugees said, that as of March , ,, Ukrainians had left their homes.  Over half of these, ,,, have entered into Poland, the main destination of refugees so far, but it is not known how many intend to stay here, or move in to other countries. Despite its size, Moldova has taken in , people, the most per capita of any nation. Over , Ukrainians, largely from the country’s eastern regions, have fled into Russia.

They tweeted: “Today, Russian forces shot and killed  people standing in line for bread in Chernihiv.Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletinhere  “Such horric attacks must stop. We are considering all available options to ensure accountability for any atrocity crimes in Ukraine.” The slayings are the latest in a longline of horric Russian attacks on unarmed Ukrainians, despite the Kremlin promising not to attack civilians. Putinaposs invasion is thought to have taken longer than the Russian president had planned and Moscow appears to have switched to repeat air strikes of residential areas. A maternity and childrenaposs hospital was hit in Mariupol, and hundreds of citizens have been killed since.  Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog The relentless attacks have also forced more than three million Ukrainians to flee their homes. Earlier today, upsetting drone footage from Ukraine appears to show a man being shot dead by Russian soldiers after he got out of his car with his hands up. It is believed the civilian was killed in front of a woman and child who were still in the car before they were later led away to a wooded area at the side of the road. Last week, -year-old Anastasia Stoluk was gunned down by “drunk Russian troops” in a village near Kyiv, as the Russian atrocities continued. It comes as former world heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko hit back at Vladimir Putinaposs “bulls*** claimRussiais only targeting military targets inUkraine .Klitschko has been on the front lines as part of his role as the mayor of Kyiv, and has witnessed first hand the destruction in his city. Both he and his brother Wladimir, also a boxing legend, are helping to keep the city safe amid a number of attacks from Russian military. Vitali himself is reported to have picked up arms against Russian soldiers, and slammed Putin again for his comments about only attacking military targets. When asked about it by Channel  reporter Chris Reason in front of another destroyed Kyiv building, Klitschko responded: Bulls***!

First-time dog owners can become paranoid over the strangest of things - such as whether their has taken too many or too few toilet trips that day. But according to a vet, most owners have been making a huge mistake with their dogs, which could be the reason for their training or behavioural issues.Taking to Reddit, one vet has explained the common mistake owners make when welcoming a new puppy into their home. to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. They said: Not letting your dogs around other dogs until they have all their vaccines.Their socialisation window closes about  weeks, meaning it is pretty much closedyou wait until  weeks. This causes a lot of dogs to go nuts and freak out whenever they see something they didnapost see during that period. While urging owners to socialise their new puppies in a safe environments, they warned them against taking their dog to a park or open space commonly used by dog walkers. They need to be around other dogs and other people in controlled situations - puppy socialisation classes, friends houses, they added. Make sure the dogs they are around are healthy, vaccinated, and good with puppies and let them have positive experiences with other dogs and people. Obviously never get behind on their vaccines while youaposre doing this. To accustom a puppy to dferent people and aposunknownapos objects, the vet says owners should introduce them to their tall friends, friends of dferent races and friends with beards, hats and sunglasses.  They added: Pull out the broom, an umbrella, an iron board while giving them treats and having fun the whole time. Try to let them walk on slick floors, bricks and carpet so they wonapost have fears of those things - and always happy. Every happy, positive interaction with something makes them less afraid. Every lack of exposure, or negative interaction, makes them more afraid. Your dog is your friend, not your slave. Your goal is not to make him do exactly whatever you want no matter what. Itaposs to make him have good manners, but also let him have his own preferences, too. Youaposre not training him like heaposs in the circus to do a bunch of stuff for your amusement. Youaposre teaching him how to move safely in the world, which means not doing something - biting, urinating in the house, jumping uncontrollably - that will be a threat to his le some day.More dogs are surrendered and euthanized for behaviour reasons than any other reason. When asked how an owner can socialise an older dog who missed this step during their puppyhood, the vet advised the aposclassical conditioningapos technique. The vet added: Most training relies on operant conditioning, which is the aposwhen you do desired action X, I give you a rewardapos. Classical conditioning does not rely on a given action or cue, so itaposs less intuitive. Youaposll often hear lies like aposIf theyaposre scared, donapost give them a treat, youaposll reward the fear.apos This is not true, especially when it comes to emotional responses in dogs.

walk on the wild side at its latest meeting as Argyll Estates# head stalker set his sights on an entertaining evening.Tom Kirsop provided society members with an informative and imaginative talk at their February gathering, covering his work and experiences on the local estate.Growing up in Clydebank, Tom had always had an interest in animals and moved to Argyll as a forest ranger in Dalmally.Since starting to work with Argyll Estates, which he thoroughly enjoys, Tom has been able to develop his work with animals in many dferent ways.In Queen Victoria’s time the current ,-acre estate was on an even bigger scale and has witnessed a huge increase in the number of deer since then.This has been due to the lack of any natural predators and, with further planting of trees since the s, the deer have had more protective covering.Modern inventions such as drones and the use of argocats, have made it easier for people working on estates to estimate numbers of deer more accurately and to be able to meet the necessary annual targets of keeping the deer population to manageable levels.Working on the estate also involves a range of other projects, such as collecting data on golden eagles, barn owls, making fishing available at the Glen Shira dam and taking clients out stalking.More recently Tom has started up West Highland Wildle Tours to give people of all ages a real insight into the wildle and beautul scenery on our doorstep.For the society#s March meeting, Ken MacTaggart will give a presentation about #The Medieval Pilgrim Way to Loch Awe#.The venue will be Inveraray church hall on Tuesday March , starting at .pm.Everyone is welcome.

Court trial over whether Ed Sheeran’s hit Shape Of You has “signicant similarities” or is “distinctively dferent” from a song he is accused of ripping off.American forensic musicologist Anthony Ricigliano concluded in a report for alegal row that it was “objectively unlikely” that any similarities between the  track and the song Oh Why by Sami Chokri “result from copying”.But Christian Siddell, another musicologist, reported that he found melodic similarities were “so numerous and striking that the possibility of independent creation is… highly improbable”.Mr Sheeran and his co-writers, Snow Patrol’s John McDaid and producer Steven McCutcheon, deny that Shape Of You copies part of the  song by Mr Chokri – a grime artist who performs under the name Sami Switch.Mr Chokri and his co-writer Ross O’Donoghue claim that a central “Oh I” hook in Mr Sheeran and his co-authors’ track is “strikingly similar” to an “Oh Why” refrain in their own composition.vw,vw,px, px\"Sami Chokri Both musicology experts gave evidence on their analysis of the songs at an ongoing trial in London on Wednesday.In a joint written statement, they agreed that “when heard in the context of their respective works, the words ‘Oh why’ and ‘Oh I’ may be phonetically indistinguishable from each other to the casual listener”.They also agreed that neither of them had found “the same combination of either the ‘Oh Why’ phrase – combined phonetic sound plus pitch and rhythm – nor the ‘Oh I’ phrase – combined phonetic sound plus pitch and rhythm – in any other compositions”.Lawyers for Mr Chokri and Mr O’Donoghue allege that when the two songs’ melodies are transposed into the same key “the progression of notes is the same”.They also claim the rhythm of the tracks’ melodies are “almost identical”, their use of instrumentation “creates a strikingly similar sound and texture” and the vowel sounds in the chanted tune “further enhances the similarity”..removevw,vw,px, px\"Songwriter John McDaid Mr Ricigliano, who was instructed by the Shape Of You co-writers’ lawyers but told the court he was “completely impartial”, said in a report that he considered the extent of the alleged similarities between the two songs to be “overstated”.He wrote that “the overall design and musical development of the melodic, harmonic and lyrical content in the relevant phrase in Shape Of You are distinctively dferent from that utilised in Oh Why”.Mr Ricigliano added: “Such similarities as there are, when placed in context, in my view lack signicance in relation to the allegation of copying from Oh Why.“They are commonplace forms of expression, both in terms of use by other writers and by Mr Sheeran himself.“My view is therefore that it is objectively unlikely that any similarities result from copying.”In court, Andrew Sutclfe QC, representing Mr Chokri and Mr O’Donoghue, asked him: “You accept, don’t you Mr Ricigliano, that despite all your research you have not found any examples in any corner of the earth over the past  years which sound phonetically the same as the chorus in Oh Why and the post chorus in Shape Of You.”vw,vw,px, px\"Ed Sheeran outside the High Court “That’s correct,” Mr Ricigliano said.“Do you not find this extraordinary ” Mr Sutclfe asked, with the expert replying: “No”.The barrister described the two song phrases as appearing “within months of each other” and suggested they sound “almost the same”.“I would disagree with the characterisation,” Mr Ricigliano said, adding that the two are “coincidentally similar” and have “distinctive dferences”.Mr Sheeran has argued in his written evidence that his song’s Oh I phrase uses “a basic minor pentatonic pattern” which is “entirely commonplace”.In court, Mr Siddell, who was instructed by Mr Chokri and Mr O’Donoghue’s lawyers but outlined his own professional opinion in his report, said he felt there had been “over emphasis” in relation to references to the minor pentatonic scale in the case, adding: “The Oh I and Oh Why phrases are melodies not scales.”In his own report he concluded that there were “striking and substantial similarities between certain aspects of the lead vocal melody of Oh Why and Shape Of You”.He said the two melodies were “nearly identical in respect of their rhythm and pitch”, the phonetic sounds of the vocal lines were “musically indistinguishable to the ear” and other compositional similarities included the use of “phrase repetition” and “the musical dynamics”.Mr Siddell said that similarities between the two works were “unlikely to be the consequence of coincidence”.“From a solely musical perspective, I find the melodic similarities to be so numerous and striking that the possibility of independent creation is in my view highly improbable,” he said.He added: “Had I been consulted in a ‘ compliance’ capacity as to whether a licence should be sought from the writers of Oh Why, my guidance would have been, in summary, that either the melodic phrase should be omitted and replaced with original new material or a licence should be obtained.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga,

the previous weekend through a flurry of late goals, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils took the lead within the opening minute.Captain Keith Mitchell’s ball down the left channel found winger Scott Souden, who cut inside and rounded the far-advanced St Peter’s goalkeeper, way out of his penalty area, and tucked the ball home low from around  yards.The first half was a well-contested affair, with chances at both ends, with the Pupils’ Lewis McNaughton and Donald McCallum both going close with efforts at goal, while at the other end, St Peter’s continued to probe for an equaliser.This arrived just a few minutes before half-time, albeit in rather fortuitous circumstances, when a low shot from the visitors’ centre-forward from just inside the box evaded the grasp of keeper Alasdair Ferguson.Early into the second half, the Pupils found themselves - down after St Peter’s converted a penalty kick, skipper Mitchell having been adjudged to have brought down an onrushing midfielder.Souden then had a good chance double his and the Feather-sponsored Pupils’ goal tally after meeting Ryan Deans’ fine cross from the right-hand side of the box, but he couldn’t guide his cushioned header on target.The Pupils played the last  minutes of the match with  men when Jamie Burns was sent off for a tackle which was not malicious but was late.In believing that a goal-scoring opportunity had been denied, despite the foul taking place at least  yards from goal, the referee decided to show the Pupils defender a red card.This numerical advantage eventually paid off for the visitors in the closing minutes as a long throw-in was flicked on into a gaping space inside the box where a St Peter’s midfielder calmly side-footed a low right-foot shot into the net beyond Ferguson.It was a painful defeat for the Pupils, who acquitted themselves very well during the match and enjoyed spells of possession and pressure during the game, and in front of another healthy home crowd.However, their more clinical visitors took their chances when they arrived and managed to keep at bay most Pupils attacks in the second half to take all three points from Kintyre.Tomorrow , the Pupils host Glenvale FC, another Paisley side, in league action.Kick off is pm at Kintyre Park.

He agreed to a further meeting with the directors of Dunbar Community Development and Heritage Trustin February. Cllr Hampshire has not responded to email requests.Cllr Hampshire states “the woodland area is in pretty poor condition and there has never been any management take place”. DCWG has never had any role or responsibility for that part of Lochend Wood. It is in the privately owned  hectares at Hallhill West and North. DCWG have successfully managed a separate  hectares of Lochend Wood since .As Cllr Hampshire describes, drainage ditches have collapsed at his proposed site. It is now waterlogged, not suitable for construction.An environmental impact assessment is essential. His proposed site is wild land, habitat to wildle – deer, foxes, possibly badgers, many bird species, some rare, and bats too.Lochend Wood will soon be completely surrounded by built environment.Development would be catastrophic for wildle, already suffering from signicant habitat loss and stress. Cllr Hampshire acknowledges “there is still wildle in the woodland and we will do everything we can to make sure we protect that”.Clearly, the best way to protect this area for wildle, including nocturnal species, is to NOT fill it with floodlights and noisy, boisterous humans.He continues: “People complain about young people hanging around and doing things they should not be doing.”Yet this proposal aims to attract kids to a location that is isolated and not overseen. This is dangerous. Emergency services have been called to deal with gatherings in the woods in recent times – ambulances for vulnerable young adolescents suffering serious alcohol effects, fire services, and police to disperse large groups. This location would create a perfect storm of risk.His vision – a ‘community cafe’, open  till  – would cost tens of thousands of pounds to install basic services to the site. How could this be sustainable  Even the Bleachingfield Centre cafe, with the library on site, close to the town centre and the primary school, was not viable. He suggests young people could watch television at the hub. Why not Bleachingfield or the Hallhill Centre  Why waste precious resources Great new facilities – The Space at DunBear Park – are planned.

Tens of thousands of civilians are being killed and driven from their homes. We see the confused elderly, the frightened children, and the anxious parents nightly on our televisions. And while Ms Blythman talks of \"finding a settlement that Putin might accept\" we know exactly what Vladimir Putin might accept – he couldn’t have been clearer.Putin is not the kind of negotiator familiar from the classic business deal scenario in which I ask for a £, you offer £ and we settle for £ plus or minus a pound or two. For all the speculation about his mental health, he has been utterly consistent from the very outset. He wants Donetsk, Lukhansk, and Crimea to be ceded to Russia he wants Ukraine disarmed and permanently barred from joining either the EU or Nato. And we can be utterly confident that any Ukrainian citizens who express dissent in a future \"Ukraine\" will be labelled \"Nazis\" and treated in the same way that Putin critics like Navalny are treated in Russia. In other words, he wants Ukraine to cease to exist as a normal sovereign nation. In the meantime he pursues a policy of relentless bombing of Ukrainian cities, reducing thriving cities of the size of Edinburgh and Glasgow and larger to rubble. Sanctions will not stop this. So what does \"stand with Ukraine\" meanwe are not prepared to confront Putin more directly The technicalities of no-fly zones or other options are for the experts. But whatever the means, it is surely time for Putin to be convinced that there is a point, a \"red line\", at which the West will deploy its overwhelming force. I’ve long been sceptical of the line that we have Nato to thank for keeping the peace in Europe. Yet it is precisely Nato in its present structure that has stopped us preventing war. And, yes, I know where that possibly leads – but with each day that passes it’s becoming clearer that Putin himself is pushing for the escalation and internationalisation of the conflict. I fear that this will happen, whether we like it or not. If that is so, the question is only whether we are to be acting on the basis of our own choices or merely reacting to him – regrettably, the story thus far.George Pattison , St Monans, Fe.THE WORLD NEEDS RESOLUTE ACTIONTHE parallels between - and the last few years tell us that we face something far more sinister than a little local dficulty over Ukraine. For years Hitler and Mussolini amassed arms while Britain complacently allowed its armed forces to dwindle. They preached the right to space and the freedom to take it by force. They held in contempt the rule of law and their promises were lies, as Poland found. The point is, her fall was just the start of an obscene trajectory, and so is the current situation.An evil gospel has awful power, and Vladimir Putin’s newspeak is no less chilling for being delivered at conversational volume. Right now he is slaughtering the innocent but the trajectory includes chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and the destruction of Ukraine’s people as only step one. We should be under no illusions.Bullies don’t need non-retaliation, they need control. The world needs resolute, overwhelming actionwe are not to descend into something much worse than currently fills our screens. As a mere first step,Nato could impose a non-fly zone over non-Nato Bosnia, it can do so over Ukraine. If President Putin can be given a dignied way out, so much the better but the lives of the innocent come first.Pascal’s words stand. \"Justice without force is a myth, because there are always bad men force without justice stands convicted of itself. We must therefore put together justice and force, and so dispose things that whatever is just is mighty, and whatever is mighty is just.\"C Peter White, Torrance.* WHY are we sanctioning Russia and certain of its citizens when we have no dispute with that country We are doing more damage to ourselves than to anyone , particularly on the financial and energy fronts.Russia can sell all its energy to China, and it can bank where. Having turned the City of London into the world’s foremost facilitator and clearer of international money, we are now undoing that with our virtue-signalling action.Can Britain really afford to indulge itself for the sake of demonstrating an opinion that will alter nothing and cost us a lot Malcolm Parkin, Kinross.* AFTER last year’s award to the respected Russian journalist, Dmitri Muratov, the  Nobel Peace Prize surely belongs to Marina Ovsyannikova, for her courageous demonstration on Monday night’s Russian state TV “News” programme.John Birkett, St Andrews.SCOTLAND WILL JOIN WITH EUROPEI NOTE with interest three letters today , two from unionists Alex Gallagher, with his often-repeated too wee, too poor, no currency, no EU trope, and another from Bill Brown and his no-ferries, strength of the Union mantra. Does Mr Brown ever look south of the Border at the ious public projects which have foundered and cost billionsin overruns, HS and Crossrail to name just two  And one wonders what arguments Councillor Gallacher would usehe ever looked around him at the smallnations who are thriving mightily, somehow, without all the benefits of being attached umbilically to Westminster and England how on earth do they manage Thank goodness for Alasdair Galloway then with his explanation of why unionists desire to avoid a vote at all costs by gerrymandering and manipulation, he correctly describes their motivation: fear.Ironically though, I am in agreement with Mr Brown and Councillor Gallacher on one thing: now is not the time for a referendum. We are about to experience a period of instability and social stress that we have not experienced in my  years of le, much of it down to the policies of successive Tory and right-wing Labour governments, namely de-industrialisation, austerity, and the catastrophic pursuit of the wealth that Russias oligarchs have stolen from their people.As Mr Galloway suggests, such upheaval is usually followed by political and social realignment. Here are a couple of predictions: after Vladimir Putin is defeated the need for a United Europe will be clearer. We will see a European defence force established as part of Nato, quite quickly followed by moves to a United States of Europe. The UK will be isolated as an anachronism in a world of super states, and Scotland will take the opportunity to join with Europe as part of that process. If all of that takes  years or more then so be it, I just hope I live to see it.If I were a unionist I would take the SNP at its word and force a referendum through now it might well be their last best chance.John Jamieson, Ayr.WHY WE NEED A SUPERMAJORITYI AM constantly disappointed and dismayed when advocates for any particular cause become so committed to their goals that they fail to accept obvious truths. Alasdair Gallowayonce again fails to accept the fundamental dference between a major, possibly once in a letime, constitutional vote and a General Election. Surely even he can see that Brexit, inconceivable had a supermajority been required, has been something less than an outstanding success. There are several good reasons why a majority signicantly greater than % + is needed when seeking major long-term constitutional change.I know committed supporters of Scottish independence who share these views and would not relish victorynot wholeheartedly endorsed by the Scottish public.Jim Meikle, Killearn.Read more: Face facts over indy and start tackling real problems"},{"url":null,"title":"top-sportsbooks-online-usa-sports-betting-sites-2022","story":"Similarly, every player is dferent with distinct needs, from live betting options to competitive odds for their favourite sports and leagues.Therefore, we are conducting an in-depth analysis of the most credible sportsbooks online, rating them on a iety of criteria, so that you can choose which one is best for you.Let’s take a look.Best Online Sportsbooks .

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population.

“distinctively dferent” from a song he is accused of ripping off.American forensic musicologist Anthony Ricigliano concluded in a report for alegal row that it was “objectively unlikely” that any similarities between the  track and the song Oh Why by Sami Chokri “result from copying”.But Christian Siddell, another musicologist, reported that he found melodic similarities were “so numerous and striking that the possibility of independent creation is… highly improbable”.Mr Sheeran and his co-writers, Snow Patrol’s John McDaid and producer Steven McCutcheon, deny that Shape Of You copies part of the  song by Mr Chokri – a grime artist who performs under the name Sami Switch.Mr Chokri and his co-writer Ross O’Donoghue claim that a central “Oh I” hook in Mr Sheeran and his co-authors’ track is “strikingly similar” to an “Oh Why” refrain in their own composition. vw,vw,px, px\"Sami Chokri Both musicology experts gave evidence on their analysis of the songs at an ongoing trial in London on Wednesday.In a joint written statement, they agreed that “when heard in the context of their respective works, the words ‘Oh why’ and ‘Oh I’ may be phonetically indistinguishable from each other to the casual listener”.They also agreed that neither of them had found “the same combination of either the ‘Oh Why’ phrase – combined phonetic sound plus pitch and rhythm – nor the ‘Oh I’ phrase – combined phonetic sound plus pitch and rhythm – in any other compositions”.Lawyers for Mr Chokri and Mr O’Donoghue allege that when the two songs’ melodies are transposed into the same key “the progression of notes is the same”.They also claim the rhythm of the tracks’ melodies are “almost identical”, their use of instrumentation “creates a strikingly similar sound and texture” and the vowel sounds in the chanted tune “further enhances the similarity”. vw,vw,px, px\"Songwriter John McDaid Mr Ricigliano, who was instructed by the Shape Of You co-writers’ lawyers but told the court he was “completely impartial”, said in a report that he considered the extent of the alleged similarities between the two songs to be “overstated”.He wrote that “the overall design and musical development of the melodic, harmonic and lyrical content in the relevant phrase in Shape Of You are distinctively dferent from that utilised in Oh Why”.Mr Ricigliano added: “Such similarities as there are, when placed in context, in my view lack signicance in relation to the allegation of copying from Oh Why.“They are commonplace forms of expression, both in terms of use by other writers and by Mr Sheeran himself.“My view is therefore that it is objectively unlikely that any similarities result from copying.”In court, Andrew Sutclfe QC, representing Mr Chokri and Mr O’Donoghue, asked him: “You accept, don’t you Mr Ricigliano, that despite all your research you have not found any examples in any corner of the earth over the past  years which sound phonetically the same as the chorus in Oh Why and the post chorus in Shape Of You.” vw,vw,px, px\"Ed Sheeran outside the High Court “That’s correct,” Mr Ricigliano said.“Do you not find this extraordinary ” Mr Sutclfe asked, with the expert replying: “No”.The barrister described the two song phrases as appearing “within months of each other” and suggested they sound “almost the same”.“I would disagree with the characterisation,” Mr Ricigliano said, adding that the two are “coincidentally similar” and have “distinctive dferences”.Mr Sheeran has argued in his written evidence that his song’s Oh I phrase uses “a basic minor pentatonic pattern” which is “entirely commonplace”.In court, Mr Siddell, who was instructed by Mr Chokri and Mr O’Donoghue’s lawyers but outlined his own professional opinion in his report, said he felt there had been “over emphasis” in relation to references to the minor pentatonic scale in the case, adding: “The Oh I and Oh Why phrases are melodies not scales.”In his own report he concluded that there were “striking and substantial similarities between certain aspects of the lead vocal melody of Oh Why and Shape Of You”.He said the two melodies were “nearly identical in respect of their rhythm and pitch”, the phonetic sounds of the vocal lines were “musically indistinguishable to the ear” and other compositional similarities included the use of “phrase repetition” and “the musical dynamics”.Mr Siddell said that similarities between the two works were “unlikely to be the consequence of coincidence”.“From a solely musical perspective, I find the melodic similarities to be so numerous and striking that the possibility of independent creation is in my view highly improbable,” he said.He added: “Had I been consulted in a ‘ compliance’ capacity as to whether a licence should be sought from the writers of Oh Why, my guidance would have been, in summary, that either the melodic phrase should be omitted and replaced with original new material or a licence should be obtained.”Commments

There’s also the issue of Emirati investment in UK wind farms, already huge – what more can they do ” he said.“When we look at the dependency the West in particular has built up on Putin’s hydrocarbons, on Putin’s oil and gas, we can see what a mistake that was, because he’s been able to blackmail the West and hold western economies to ransom.“We need independence.”Mr Johnson pledged that his long-awaited energy strategy will come “next week” and include a “massive jump forward on renewables, more nuclear, using our own hydrocarbons more effectively” and sourcing fuel from outside Russia.However, Downing Street’s account of the meeting with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed did not say whether the Prime Minister raised human rights concerns with the UAE’s crown prince. vw,vw,px, px\"Boris Johnson inspects the Guard of Honour as he arrives at Abu Dhabi airport Nor did it contain any indication Mr Johnson secured any kind of commitment on increasing oil production.A No  spokesman said: “The Prime Minister set out his deep concerns about the chaos unleashed by Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and stressed the importance of working together to improve stability in the global energy market.”The Prime Minister’s official spokesman told reporters that the “PM raised human rights issues”, but added “I don’t have any more details”, leaving open to interpretation the extent to which they discussed abuses.Critics have particularly questioned the move to strengthen ties with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with the Saudi leader implicated in the assassination of US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi in .Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said “going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is not an energy strategy”. vw,vw,px, px\"Boris Johnson is welcomed by Mohammed bin Salman ahead of a meeting at the royal court in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Conservative MPs and human rights watchdogs are among those calling on the Prime Minister to question the countries on their track records, after Saudi Arabia executed on Saturday  people convicted of crimes ranging from killings to belonging to militant groups.The state-run Saudi Press Agency said three more iniduals had been executed on the day of Mr Johnson’s visit.Maya Foa, the director of human rights advocacy group Reprieve, said: “By travelling to meet Mohammed bin Salman so soon after a mass execution, Boris Johnson clearly signalled that infor oil, the UK will tolerate even the gravest human rights abuses.“Carrying out these executions while the leader of a western power is on Saudi soil was a provocative act, designed to flaunt the Crown Prince’s power and impunity to the world.”Mohammed bin Salman has largely been shunned by the West after US intelligence alleged he ordered the murder of Mr Khashoggi at the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul, something the Saudi ruler denies.🚨BREAKING: Saudi Arabia executed  more people this morning during @BorisJohnsons visit.Travelling to Saudi Arabia after a mass execution signaled the UK will tolerate the gravest human rights abuses.

Johnson has blood on his hands— ReprieveMarch , One person who did embrace him, however, was the Russian president, with the prince and Mr Putin sharing a high-five and a laugh at a G summit in the month after Mr Khashoggi’s death.Mr Johnson has argued he needs to “build the widest possible coalition” to address Mr Putin’s attack on Ukraine.Conservative MP Julian Lewis, who chairs Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee, called on the Government to ensure that “in seeking to lessen our dependence upon one source of oil and gas, we do not end up creating a source dependency on another unreliable and sometimes hostile regime”.Mr Johnson, who travelled overnight before beginning the trip in the UAE on Wednesday, is being joined by investment minister Lord Grimstone."},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-268-todays-wordle-word-14-march-hints-answer  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Women living in rural areas across the UK are also much more likely than men to seek help with %, saying they would talk to someonethey were struggling .i The findings come as Samaritans launches a new phase of its Real People, Real Stories campaign, supported by NFU Mutual Charitable Trust, which aims to reach men in rural communities who are struggling to cope to prevent them reaching crisis point. In the UK and Ireland, men are three to four times more likely to die by suicide than women.Over three quarters of people in Northern Ireland living in rural areasalso said there was at least one barrier that would stop them reaching out for support eventhey were struggling. Lack of privacySamaritans discovered the top three barriers are concern over lack of privacy , not knowing who to turn toand stigma around mental health .As evidence suggests that suicide rates are higher in rural areas compared to urban areasiii and rural-based occupations, such as those in agriculture, have also been shown to have an increased risk of suicide, the UK’s leading suicide prevention charity is raising awareness amongst men in these environments to let them know they do not need to face things alone. Nigel, a Samaritan volunteer in Northern Ireland who is a farmer said: “The farming communities tend to have less contact with the outside world, they are isolated, feel undervalued and have many financial issues. Many are working full time in jobs and trying to farm at the same time.“From my experience farming communities are less likely to seek help as they don’t want other people to know about their problems, there is a real fear of being judged. As a farmer myself I get a lot from volunteering with Samaritans, I can be there for people when they need someone.”Real People, Real StoriesSpeaking about the Charity’s Real People, Real Stories campaign, Professor Siobhan O’Neill, Mental Health Champion for Northern Ireland said: “People who live in rural areas can feel disconnected and isolated, and this can lead to suicidal pain. “There is so much stigma surrounding mental health and it can be hard to find the words to say that we are struggling. It is important that we all understand and speak about our feelings, and that people who are suffering reach out for support. “Suicidal thoughts are a sign that something about our lives needs to change and this campaign shows us the benefits of reaching out for help and reminds us that change is possible”. Marie Nesbitt Samaritans Ballymena Branch Manager commented: “Samaritans is here for anyone struggling to cope, no matter who you are or where you are. “Mental health challenges and suicide are complex, going beyond simply where you live or what profession you are in but these can be factors. The increased risk factors for those living in rural and agricultural settings such as poor access to services, isolation and persistent loneliness mean it’s essential for us to do more to reach people in these environments. “We hope this new Real People, Real Stories campaign will raise awareness of the support that’s out there and encourage more people to seek help early on, so that we can continue the drive to reduce suicide rates across NI.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4519110.jpg--.jpg?1647425130000\n","title":"win an opportunity to meet professor brian cox","story":"Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is delighted to be working in partnership with Well North Enterprisesand Professor Brian Cox CBE to bring the prestigious Science Summer School to Northern Ireland in November  at The Braid Arts Centre, Ballymena.Through collaboration with headline sponsor Ryobi Aluminium Casting and key sponsors Almac Group, IPC Mouldings, Michelin Development, Northern Regional College, Randox Laboratories and Terumo Blood and Cell Technologies the event will aim to inspire young people to become the next generation of scientists with an inspirational programme that mixes the best of STEAMthrough a series of TED-style talks, seminars, discussions and hands-on workshops.The Science Summer School is not a stand-alone event but is a catalyst for a collaborative vision for the borough to nurture future talent and as part of the event we are asking pupils to ‘Activate your Curiosity’ by creating an original t-shirt design that reflects one of three themes: Activate your Curiosity First Attempts or The Universe.There are fantastic prizes on offer - the winning t-shirt will be printed and the designer will have the opportunity to meet Professor Brian Cox CBE in November .The best ideas will also be included in the Gallery of First Attempts exhibition in the Mid-Antrim Museum at The Braid in conjunction with this exciting event.The competition is open to all schools in the borough from Key Stage  through to Key Stage  and to enter students must attend a school in the Mid and East Antrim Borough Council area.

In addition, almost % of our woodland is in the form of recent coner plantations.The Woodland Trust said Northern Ireland needs to signicantly increase tree plantingit is to help towards a UK woodland target.The conservation charity previously published its Emergency Tree Plan. The plan sets out how the UK can rapidly increase tree cover to help reach net zero carbon emissions and tackle the declines in wildle.Northern Ireland would need to plant , hectares of trees a year to hit an existing target of % cover by . To contribute to this, the Forests For our Future Programme announced by Mr Poots in March  set targets to create , hectares of new woodland by , which falls well short of those recommended by the Woodland Trust.The Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairshas a woodland expansion target  hectares for  .Ammonia emissionsAmmonia is an air pollutant largely emitted from agriculture and has a damaging impact on bioersity, including sensitive habitats, as well as human health. It is produced by many common farming activities, such as the housing of livestock, the storage and spreading of manure and slurries, and the application of fertiliser.An Audit Office report from February found that most areas of Northern Ireland, including designated sites and other priority habitats, are affected by high levels of nitrogen being deposited on land and into water surfaces.The levels in most areas are signicantly above what is considered their “critical load”, the concentration of nitrogen at which signicant ecological damage occurs. Northern Ireland is responsible for % of UK ammonia emissions, despite only having % of its population and % of its land area, and is the only region of the UK where ammonia levels have not been decreasing.“Failure to address the increasing level of ammonia emissions also has the potential to contribute to serious, long-term harm to the environment and human health,” the report concluded.Mr Poots has conceded that a failure to publish an Ammonia Reduction Strategywill be a regret when he leaves office and it is one that has left the department vulnerable to legal challenge. However, he stresses that he wants to publish a strategy before leaving office.Independent Environmental Protection AgencyUnder an outline programme for government in the New Decade, New Approach, a number of coordinated measures to reverse climate change were laid out.They included an Independent Environmental Protection Agencyto oversee targets that would be set as part of climate change legislation.Mr Poots is opposed to the establishment of an IEPA, believing it to be unnecessary bureaucracy. However, he has proposed setting up an office of environmental protection to do similar independent work.Conservation Management PlansNorthern Ireland is home to important nature and wildle, of both national and international importance, which are a key part of the Northern Ireland landscape, providing a wide range of goods and services to society and helping to deal with climate change.The UK faced formal infringement proceedings by the European Commission because of the failure to have in place Conservation Management Plansfor its European sites.There are  special areas of conservation and  special protection areas in Northern Ireland. Strangford Lough and Rathlin Island were reported to the commission as having a CMP in place.That leaves  sites without such plans in Northern Ireland.At the time of the infraction proceedings it was reported to the Commission Rathlin Island and Strangford Lough had Conservation Management Plansin place.The Commission took the view that developing CMPs for each of the remaining SACs would signicantly contribute to addressing the alleged failings to comply with the obligations under the Habitats Directive.DAERA subsequently embarked on a signicant programme of work to develop such CMPs to date draft CMPs have been developed for  of the SAC sites, with the intention to have draft plans for all SACs completed by December .Clear AirAir pollution is the top environmental risk to human health in the UK, and the fourth greatest threat to public health after cancer, heart disease and obesity.The Clean Air Strategy, published in January  by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs , sets out a number of objectives to improve air quality across the UK.Additionally, DAERA issued a Clean Air Strategy for Northern Ireland Discussion Document for public consideration in November . The period of public discussion closed in early .This strategy aims to build on existing improvements within Northern Ireland and seeks to tackle important cross-Departmental issues relating to transport, energy, agriculture, industry, local air quality management, and communications.An air quality strategy was anticipated but has not been published. Minister Poots says that recommendations await the next office holder.Mobuoy super dumpAt public meetings, government officials have been repeatedly challenged to urgently deal with an estimated one million cubic metres of waste at the Mobuoy “super dump” on the outskirts of Derry. The River Faughan which forms the western boundary of the site supplies the city with % of its drinking water.Ongoing legal action has been blamed for delaying remediation work at the site. That trial is due to commence next month.The clean-up cost at Mobuoy has been estimated at a minimum of £ million — and potentially as much as £ million.NI Water and DAERA have always assured the public that chemicals present in drinking water are at safe levels. However, campaigners contend there are “no safe levels” of arsenic or manganese as exposure to such chemicals can have a long-term damaging effect on the brain.It is expected that based on successful approval of a business case, a remediation contractor will be appointed by late .Ban on petroleum licensingIn a somewhat unexpected move, the DUP Economy Minister, Gordon Lyons, announced that he would support a ban on fracking and onshore petroleum licensing activity in Northern Ireland.Fracking is broadly banned across the UK and Ireland. In England, the Government told the industry it would not agree to any future fracking “until compelling new evidence is provided” that it was safe.Two petroleum licensing applications in NI relate to Fermanagh, where a company called Tamboran Resources UK applied for a licence in .A separate application from EHA Exploration takes in five council areas: Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Mid Ulster.However, Sinn Fein said it is “bitterly disappointing” that as a result of the DUP collapsing the Executive, that ban cannot now be brought forward.Water pollutionA recent ‘Water Framework Directive Statistics Report’ determined that none of Northern Ireland’s  rivers, lakes and coastal waters achieved a “good overall status” rating for water quality.Environmentalists have argued that minimal fines handed down for water pollution do not act as an appropriate deterrent for repeat offenders.Figures obtained by Green Party MLA Rachel Woods showed that more than seven million tonnes of raw sewage is being dumped into Northern Ireland’s seas and rivers every year.NI Water requires investment of around £bn in water and wastewater services over a six year period, the Utility Regulator said in May.

In the past, DUP MP Sammy Wilson strongly opposed proposals saying that low-income households who use cheap coal would be adversely affected as smokeless coal costs more.In response, then Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said: “It is great to hear Saint Sammy, defender of the disadvantaged — I do not know what happened to Sammy, the champion of the Tory cuts — make all these arguments on behalf of those suffering fuel poverty.“There is not a word about the big business interests of those in the coal business or, indeed, the interests of Larne port in his own constituency.”DUP MLA Michelle McIlveen, who was DAERA Minister before the Assembly collapsed, also said it was not her intention to ban smoky coal in the North.Now, Mr Poots, says he has no intention of banning coal because people would “die of hypothermia” in homes that are not properly insulated.Most ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestA sit-in fish supper could climb to £ in Belfast, says restaurant ownerNorthern Ireland power station wants to ditch Russian coal — but Stormont says noGrenadiers flute band marches to a dferent beatNew dining and nightle hotspot planned for ‘neglected’ Belfast district as £m ploughed into city centreTop VideosPlayMoral questions raised over use of Russian coal in Northern Ireland PlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayA fish supper in Belfast could soon hit £, Fish City owner warns Latest EnvironmentMLA seeks to investigate recent surge in fuel prices amid Kilroot Power Station confusionUp to £m of RHI money may go unspent by StormontStormont crisis ‘farcical and very damaging’ – Green Party leader easy ways to ‘green-proof’ your home that won’t cost the earth and will reduce your billsSam McBrideOpinionBasic, inexcusable failures mean that recyclable items are being dumpedLatestCovid ‘not yet seasonal or predictable’, says WHOEurope’s markets bounce back over Ukraine talks and China stimulusNazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe prepares to fly home following Iran ordealIn Pictures: Weather makes the biggest splash at Cheltenham Ladies DayNazanin Zaghari-Raclfe’s release could set precedent for political hostage-taking, MPs warn,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Our direct competitors in the Republic of Ireland are dealing with such signicant applications much more efficiently. This is a major consideration for companies deciding where to invest.”Alliance MLA Andrew Muir said the delays point to a “systemic problem” at the heart of DfI, which “ought to be leading as a role model in planning matters, but instead is more like a black hole where key planning applications disappear for determination to be delayed for years”.“Nothing less than radical reform is needed to ensure the voices of communities are better heard and applications not left sitting stuck in the system without a decision to reject or approve,” he added.DfI said: “The department is working closely with key stakeholders in a number of ways to improve processes and increase the efficiency of the planning system to ensure that planning applications are processed in a timely manner. “A review of the implementation of the Planning Act has been completed. In addition, the department, as part of a collaborative project with  councils, will be delivering a new planning IT system next year which will improve the submission and processing of planning applications.“A planning engagement partnership has also been established to look at how to enhance the quality and depth of community engagement in the planning process at both the regional and local planning levels.“It is hoped that the collective improvements delivered from this work will improve processes and increase the efficiency of the planning system across the board.”Related topicsAndrew MuirDepartment for InfrastructureNichola MallonMore On Andrew MuirAlliance MLAs believe recorded vote was required for key climate bill amendmentMost NI schools have not had to move to remote learning despite Covid-related absences, says Education Minister PremiumBids for extra funding for Northern Ireland road repairs hit -year low PremiumViewpointOpinionSkimping on road repairs must stopDUP is slammed over £m of extra funding now ‘in limbo’Most ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestA sit-in fish supper could climb to £ in Belfast, says restaurant ownerNorthern Ireland power station wants to ditch Russian coal — but Stormont says noGrenadiers flute band marches to a dferent beatNew dining and nightle hotspot planned for ‘neglected’ Belfast district as £m ploughed into city centreTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayMoral questions raised over use of Russian coal in Northern Ireland PlayA fish supper in Belfast could soon hit £, Fish City owner warns Latest Northern IrelandMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageEmergency care public consultation launched as Robin Swann aims to alleviate ‘severe pressure’ in systemPolice officers and member of public taken to hospital after vehicle involved in crash in LarneCatholic Church explores using unused buildings to house Ukrainian refugeesArchbishops unite to press UK government on visas for Ukrainian refugeesLatestNazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe prepares to fly home following Iran ordealIn Pictures: Weather makes the biggest splash at Cheltenham Ladies DayNazanin Zaghari-Raclfe’s release could set precedent for political hostage-taking, MPs warnEnergumene wins battle of heavyweights and Champion Chase glory as Shishkin pulled upFormer Holby City stars toto show for last episode this month,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He did not want to elaborate further at this point.He asked the committee to write a letter as a body to add heft to the request for the competition regulator to investigate. He told the committee he wanted to make sure consumers are getting value for money.The committee also heard demands for answers from government departments on what exactly the policy is on the importation of Russian coal amid confusion over its use by Kilroot Power Station.The economy committee was responding to the revelations in the Belfast , that the power station wants to switch to other suppliers but cannot do so because of licensing requirements imposed by Stormont.East Antrim MLA Stewart Dickson, whose constituency includes the facility, said he was very disappointed to hear the Department for the Economy had no comment and is passing the buck to the Department of Agriculture.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up They have to get out of their silos and do their job, the Alliance Party representative said.Mr Dickson said he realised the station is required to burn low sulphur coal but added Russia is not the only supplier.

My god-daughter Lily likes to call me uncle Hagrid.“I do get askedI would like to shave it off for charity, but that’s never going to happen. I know what I look like underneath it - bowling ball comes to mind! No, it’s staying, I’ll stick to doing the half-marathons for charity.“Anyway, my son Thomas says it’s the only thing that’s cool about me. He’s  and anything a -year-old says is cool about his old man has to be kept. He likes the beard, though not the public profile so much.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The voting, ran by the Beard Liberation Front, took place over two preliminary rounds earlier this month, with the final nominations lined up for an online ‘beard-off’ between March -.Those in the final selection included former Open golf championship winner Shane Lowry, Health Minister Robin Swann, broadcaster William Crawley, Maynooth University professor Peter Coles and Matthew O’Toole of the SDLP.“I would have loved to see Robin Swann get some recognition for all his hard work over these past two years,” said Aodhan, congratulating his fellow competitors on their nominations.Success on the beard stage doesn’t come easy, though. For Aodhan, keeping it trim is a daily routine of essential oils and conditioner.He said: “It gets the works every day. You suffer for the success. It’s a daily shampoo, conditioner, oil and balm experience to keep it up to scratch.“It always give people something to talk about. It has a le of its own and has given me a fair few nicknames over the years. I remember being introduced at an academic event recently as the Brian Blessed of Brexit. That was quite an honour.”It might be an evening toasting his beard recognitions with a Guinness, but Aodhan said he won’t let the success go to his head.“There won’t be anything crazy like dying it green for St Patrick’s Day. It’s had a few makeover over the years. It was a cheesy goatee for a while, I’m sure it won#t mind me mentioning that, so it’s had an interesting and eventful le.”Previous winners of The Beard Liberation Front, the informal network of beard wearers, include SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, who didn’t make the cut for the final this year.Keith Flett of the Beard Liberation Front said: “The poll is specically about the impact the beard of an inidual has made in Irish public le and no other factor.“Aodhan Connolly is to be congratulated on being the first person to win consecutive titles. Clearly his beard is making a positive impact in the public eye.”Most ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestA sit-in fish supper could climb to £ in Belfast, says restaurant ownerNorthern Ireland power station wants to ditch Russian coal — but Stormont says noGrenadiers flute band marches to a dferent beatNew dining and nightle hotspot planned for ‘neglected’ Belfast district as £m ploughed into city centreTop VideosPlayMoral questions raised over use of Russian coal in Northern Ireland PlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayA fish supper in Belfast could soon hit £, Fish City owner warns Latest Northern IrelandMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageEmergency care public consultation launched as Robin Swann aims to alleviate ‘severe pressure’ in systemPolice officers and member of public taken to hospital after vehicle involved in crash in LarneCatholic Church explores using unused buildings to house Ukrainian refugeesArchbishops unite to press UK government on visas for Ukrainian refugeesLatestCovid ‘not yet seasonal or predictable’, says WHOEurope’s markets bounce back over Ukraine talks and China stimulusNazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe prepares to fly home following Iran ordealIn Pictures: Weather makes the biggest splash at Cheltenham Ladies DayNazanin Zaghari-Raclfe’s release could set precedent for political hostage-taking, MPs warn,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Kilroot power station said that shipment was not for it, and it last brought in Russian coal on th February. The power station, which dominates the northern shoreline of Belfast Lough just east of Carrickfergus, is our last coal-fired electricity generation plant and is due to close next year.Read MoreUkrainian refugee scheme: Vital that sponsors in Northern Ireland are properly checked, warns anti-slavery expertUp to £m of RHI money may go unspent by StormontHowever, it is still key to keeping the lights on, and has been called upon more in recent years due to problems at other power stations and unusually calm days reducing wind power generation.Coal was Russia’s third most valuable export by value in , bringing in £.bn. Northern Ireland was the only UK region to see coal-fired electricity generation increase that year, accounting for % of all electricity.Energy imports from Russia have not been banned, but have come under scrutiny due to revulsion at Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the escalation of the war through the targeting of civilians.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Kilroot’s position appears similar to that of Shell, which bought Russian oil — entirely legally — days into the Ukraine war, but backtracked under huge public pressure and promised not to do so again.Read MoreMalachi O#Doherty:OpinionMy utility bills now cost £ a week. Pensioners are in big troubleHowever, Kilroot’s situation is complicated by what it says is a requirement in its licence to buy Russian coal for environmental reasons, because it is low-sulphur, and thus somewhat reduces air pollution when burned.!forfort[r].style.e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"When Stormont’s Department for the Economy, which is responsible for electricity policy, was askedit believed environmental rules should be relaxed to allow Kilroot to burn dirtier coal, it initially washed its hands of the matter, saying: “The department does not have responsibility for environmental rules. This is the responsibility of DAERA Northern Ireland Environment Agency .”That answer came despite the RHI Inquiry recommending Stormont stopped operating in silos and behaved coherently as a single government entity.However, Kilroot’s owner then told the Belfastit had been meeting the department, NIEA, electricity grid operator SONI and the Utility Regulator to discuss this issue since the crisis began. That was put to the Department for the Economy and to Edwin Poots’ Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, which is responsible for NIEA.But there was no response at the time of going to press.EP Kilroot, a subsidiary of Czech company Energetický, which owns the plant, said it “condemns the indefensible aggression and actions by Russia”.It added that it “complies with all UK sanctions and associated regulations in relation to Russia”, and stressed there were “signicant stock levels of coal on the Kilroot site at present”.It said: “We have contingency plans in place for alternative sources of coal supply. “This plan requires changing EP Kilroot’s permit, which currently prevents us from using coals from other countries.“Since the start of the Ukraine crisis, EP Kilroot has chaired a number of roundtable workshops with officials from DfE, NIEA, the Utility Regulator and SONI to urgently address the issues of the current permitting arrangements to enable EP Kilroot to remove its reliance on Russian coal.“If the permitting arrangements are not changed, we believe there will be signicant security of supply risks that SONI will need to manage.”The company claimed there could also be “signicant additional costs” for consumers “depending on the extent to which the coal units are restricted”.When DfE, headed by DUP minister Gordon Lyons, was asked for its view on whether Kilroot should continue to buy Russian coal, the department expressed no preference, and said: “The purchase of coal is a commercial decision taken by EP Kilroot. However, the department will follow the guidance that has been issued by the UK Government in relation to Russian imports.”When asked how much coal stocks were in place at Kilroot, DfE said “this is not a matter for the department”, but SONI would tell itthere was a problem. When asked how much secondary fuel was stored at Kilroot, DfE said that was a matter for the company.SONI said it was “unaware of any immediate risk to coal stock at Kilroot”. It said inspection of fuel stocks was “not a matter for SONI”. It added Kilroot “has a key role to play in the energy transition”, involving the current generators as well as new gas turbines.Belfast Harbour said it was “working closely with shipping agents and relevant partners to implement all of the Government’s legislative sanctions on Russian vessels”, but it would only bar vessels excluded by law, rather than go further.The Utility Regulator said Kilroot was responsible for ensuring it held adequate fuel stocks. It added: “In light of the ongoing situation in Ukraine, we are working with DfE to proactively monitor the situation, and are engaging with EP Kilroot and other key stakeholders on a regular basis about fuel stocks and fuel security arrangements.”Overall imports of coal have generally been falling, but have risen to the point where they are now roughly where they were in , despite the reduction in the use of coal for home-heating and electricity generation.Irish state-owned electricity company ESB said it will not be taking delivery of Russian coal to its Moneypoint power station in Co Clare “for the foreseeable future”. It was reported that members of staff at the River Shannon facility had expressed concerns to management about accepting Russian coal in the current circumstances.On Monday, Andrei Melnichenko, owner of Russia’s biggest coal producer, said publicly that the war in Ukraine was a tragedy that must be stopped.Most ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestA sit-in fish supper could climb to £ in Belfast, says restaurant ownerNorthern Ireland power station wants to ditch Russian coal — but Stormont says noGrenadiers flute band marches to a dferent beatNew dining and nightle hotspot planned for ‘neglected’ Belfast district as £m ploughed into city centreTop VideosPlayMoral questions raised over use of Russian coal in Northern Ireland PlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayA fish supper in Belfast could soon hit £, Fish City owner warns Latest Northern IrelandMan arrested in Lyra McKee murder probe released pending report to prosecutorsMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageEmergency care public consultation launched as Robin Swann aims to alleviate ‘severe pressure’ in systemPolice officers and member of public taken to hospital after vehicle involved in crash in LarneCatholic Church explores using unused buildings to house Ukrainian refugeesLatestMan arrested in Lyra McKee murder probe released pending report to prosecutorsCovid ‘not yet seasonal or predictable’, says WHOEurope’s markets bounce back over Ukraine talks and China stimulusNazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe prepares to fly home following Iran ordealIn Pictures: Weather makes the biggest splash at Cheltenham Ladies Day,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney PA WireSam McBrideTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailStormont is on course to waste at least £m — and perhaps as much as £m — over the next  years due to its failure to find a way to spend Treasury funding made available to Northern Ireland for subsidising renewable heat.As revealed by the Belfastlast week, £m has already been wasted in this way and there is no sign of the Department for the Economy producing an alternative proposal for how it can spend the money.However, new figures show the vast scale of the waste aheadthe situation remains unaltered. In response to a Freedom of Information request from the Renewable Heat Association— which represents most RHI claimants — the department said that it was now on course to underspend by around £m. However, those figures only cover expenditure until , yet the GB RHI scheme — from whose budget Northern Ireland’s share of money for renewable heat is derived — has been extended and will not now close until .Based on that longer duration for the GB scheme, RHANI has calculated that Northern Ireland’s underspend may be closer to £m.Read MoreCriticism as Queen’s University Belfast ‘spends over £k’ on Amazon during pandemicThe hidden RHI scandal of how Stormont wasted £m in green energy subsidiesThe department said that it “will explore the potential to utilise any available [Treasury] funds in support of alternative or additional actions to decarbonise heat”. However, there is still no suggestion that this work has reached an advanced stage nor even that it will be possible because the Executive remains unable to decide how to handle existing RHI claimants.Those claimants were promised unalterable payments for  years but once the calamitous scale of the RHI overspend became apparent, Stormont abandoned that promise and retrospectively slashed their payments, meaning the actual overspend was £.m.That decision made them far less well rewarded than their counterparts in Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland, which recently launched its own version of RHI — putting Northern Irish businesses at a competitive disadvantage.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Sources within the DUP suggest that the party is split on how to handle the situation. Former leader Arlene Foster — the minister who set up the disastrous scheme but then said she was “accountable but not responsible” for the mess which followed — had endorsed a policy of throwing all RHI claimants out of the scheme, paying them a fraction of what they were originally promised as compensation. Sinn Fein has also endorsed this policy, but other DUP figures believe it is unfair to those claimants who entered the scheme in good faith, took on huge loans at the suggestion of its minister and government officials, and who did not abuse RHI.There is another factor which might explain the decision not to spend such a vast sum of money. The retrospective cuts to subsidies which had been guaranteed were immediately challenged in court by claimants. However, that process has moved tortoise-like over the last five years and has not yet gone to the Supreme Court. That case is just one of several RHI legal actions, the outcome of which the department cannot be certain.It may be that its decision not to launch a new green heat scheme is a way of hedging against the possibility that the original scheme is reinstated and it faces a vast compensation bill.Whatever the reason, it is having an increasingly stark impact. As oil and gas prices soar, renewables are among the cheapest alternatives — but have high up-front costs to install, which is why subsidies are in place where across the UK and Ireland.RHANI executive chairman Andrew Trimble said: “If civil servants had not removed  words from the national legislation on renewable heat when the NI legislation was implemented, then today we would have a strong, sustainable, environmentally friendly renewable heat sector. We would be contributing to our pathway to net zero and have a vastly reduced reliance on fossil fuels — with their polluting emissions reduced by %.”He said that Stormont could solve the problem by reinstating the missing  words — essentially replicating the GB scheme, with cost controls, something he said “could solve the political problems that Stormont and the department have created for themselves and for the people of Northern Ireland”.Mr Trimble highlighted that in , a Commons committee inquiry branded the department’s actions “a raw deal”, but the department had repeatedly failed to help genuine claimants suffering as a result of their broken promises.Related topicsDepartment for the EconomyThe Executive OfficeArlene FosterSinn FéinClimate ChangeMore On Department for the Economy‘No plans’ to ration NI’s energy over supply fearsDepartment​​ of Economy slammed over Covid spend PremiumEpidemic Belfast: Podcast takes a scalpel to our medical pastCost of living crisis leads to .% slump in retail footfall PremiumEconomy is being distorted by Invest NI focusing on Belfast, claims MLAMost ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestA sit-in fish supper could climb to £ in Belfast, says restaurant ownerNorthern Ireland power station wants to ditch Russian coal — but Stormont says noGrenadiers flute band marches to a dferent beatNew dining and nightle hotspot planned for ‘neglected’ Belfast district as £m ploughed into city centreTop VideosPlayMoral questions raised over use of Russian coal in Northern Ireland PlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayA fish supper in Belfast could soon hit £, Fish City owner warns Latest PoliticsMLA seeks to investigate recent surge in fuel prices amid Kilroot Power Station confusionAlex KaneOpinionDisagreements are only going to grow as unionism heads into election in fractured stateNorthern Ireland births, deaths and marriages can now be registered in IrishMLAs who tried to cut rents will actually force them up, claims estate agents’ bodyNew Civil Service chief silent over whistleblower caseLatestMan arrested in Lyra McKee murder probe released pending report to prosecutorsCovid ‘not yet seasonal or predictable’, says WHOEurope’s markets bounce back over Ukraine talks and China stimulusNazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe prepares to fly home following Iran ordealIn Pictures: Weather makes the biggest splash at Cheltenham Ladies Day,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Brit Awards  By Tom Pilgrim, PAMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailMusicology experts have given contrasting views at a High Court trial over whether Ed Sheeran’s hit Shape Of You has “signicant similarities” or is “distinctively dferent” from a song he is accused of ripping off.American forensic musicologist Anthony Ricigliano concluded in a report for alegal row that it was “objectively unlikely” that any similarities between the  track and the song Oh Why by Sami Chokri “result from copying”.But Christian Siddell, another musicologist, reported that he found melodic similarities were “so numerous and striking that the possibility of independent creation is… highly improbable”.Mr Sheeran and his co-writers, Snow Patrol’s John McDaid and producer Steven McCutcheon, deny that Shape Of You copies part of the  song by Mr Chokri – a grime artist who performs under the name Sami Switch.Mr Chokri and his co-writer Ross O’Donoghue claim that a central “Oh I” hook in Mr Sheeran and his co-authors’ track is “strikingly similar” to an “Oh Why” refrain in their own composition.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk face .ece AUTOCROP h bpanews_a--ed-f-ceaccc_embedded

analysis of the songs at an ongoing trial in London on Wednesday.In a joint written statement, they agreed that “when heard in the context of their respective works, the words ‘Oh why’ and ‘Oh I’ may be phonetically indistinguishable from each other to the casual listener”.They also agreed that neither of them had found “the same combination of either the ‘Oh Why’ phrase – combined phonetic sound plus pitch and rhythm – nor the ‘Oh I’ phrase – combined phonetic sound plus pitch and rhythm – in any other compositions”.Lawyers for Mr Chokri and Mr O’Donoghue allege that when the two songs’ melodies are transposed into the same key “the progression of notes is the same”.They also claim the rhythm of the tracks’ melodies are “almost identical”, their use of instrumentation “creates a strikingly similar sound and texture” and the vowel sounds in the chanted tune “further enhances the similarity”.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk  .ece AUTOCROP h

“the overall design and musical development of the melodic, harmonic and lyrical content in the relevant phrase in Shape Of You are distinctively dferent from that utilised in Oh Why”.Mr Ricigliano added: “Such similarities as there are, when placed in context, in my view lack signicance in relation to the allegation of copying from Oh Why.“They are commonplace forms of expression, both in terms of use by other writers and by Mr Sheeran himself.“My view is therefore that it is objectively unlikely that any similarities result from copying.”In court, Andrew Sutclfe QC, representing Mr Chokri and Mr O’Donoghue, asked him: “You accept, don’t you Mr Ricigliano, that despite all your research you have not found any examples in any corner of the earth over the past  years which sound

correct,” Mr Ricigliano said.“Do you not find this extraordinary ” Mr Sutclfe asked, with the expert replying: “No”.The barrister described the two song phrases as appearing “within months of each other” and suggested they sound “almost the same”.“I would disagree with the characterisation,” Mr Ricigliano said, adding that the two are “coincidentally similar” and have “distinctive dferences”.Mr Sheeran has argued in his written evidence that his song’s Oh I phrase uses “a basic minor pentatonic pattern” which is “entirely commonplace”.In court, Mr Siddell, who was instructed by Mr Chokri and Mr O’Donoghue’s lawyers but outlined his own professional opinion in his report, said he felt there had been “over emphasis” in relation to references to the minor pentatonic scale in the case, adding: “The Oh I and Oh Why phrases are melodies not scales.”In his own report he concluded that there were “striking and substantial similarities between certain aspects of the lead vocal melody of Oh Why and Shape Of You”.He said the two melodies were “nearly identical in respect of their rhythm and pitch”, the phonetic sounds of the vocal lines were “musically indistinguishable to the ear” and other compositional similarities included the use of “phrase repetition” and “the musical dynamics”.Mr Siddell said that similarities between the two works were “unlikely to be the consequence of coincidence”.“From a solely musical perspective, I find the melodic similarities to be so numerous and striking that the possibility of independent creation is in my view highly improbable,” he said.He added: “Had I been consulted in a ‘ compliance’ capacity as to whether a licence should be sought from the writers of Oh Why, my guidance would have been, in summary, that either the melodic phrase should be omitted and replaced with original new material or a licence should be obtained.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and

Matthew Martin played around several Bangor defenders and looked to pass up to Jason Campbell up front, who got into some promising positions.However, it was Bangor who broke the deadlock following a cross to the back post to take the lead.Play continued with both teams creating chances but neither were able to add to the scoreline before the end of the quarter.Bangor continued to apply pressure on lsquoHinch from the start of the second but the home side managed to manufacture counterattacks.lsquoHinch were playing the ball down the wings to Adam Dodds and Ross Connolly.Leslie Harrison played the ball out from the back to Andrew McIlwaine, only to be dispossessed by the Bangor defence.Play became end to end with teams trying to keep possession but unable to do so.

While museums are about objects, those objects have no signicance without people.People make things for particular purposes they use them, they value them, they discard them, they contemplate them. Museums try to understand objects in order to reach the peoplebehind them, understand their lives and so add meaning to our own.Local museums are concerned with all aspects of their communities. Their collections represent the inheritance, the culture, and the trust of their communities.Down County Museum has the largest collection of objects relating to farming in Ulster outside the national museums.Through the generosity of iniduals and families it has acquired not only the complete equipment of two of the last horse-powered farms in the county but a fine example of an early Ferguson tractor, with an invention which not only revolutionised agriculture but brought recognition to its County Down inventor throughout the world.A host of other items represent the history of a basic industry and developing way of le in County Down, from a wooden plough from Mourne to a donkey-powered milk churn from Ballyroney to the first reaper and binder in the area, to hay sweeps, rakes and potato diggers, scythes, rope twisters, turnip cutters, barn fans, churns, butter pats, sheep shears, horse harness, slipes, carts, Young Farmersrsquo Club trophies and records, and valuable medals given for agricultural improvements on the iable soils of County Down.We should not forget that we build on what has gone before and that is as true of our most important industry as of any other.One object which is almost entirely forgotten was the block-wheeled car, with solid wooden wheels, which was the ubiquitous load carrier before the introduction of the large-wheeled lsquoScotch cartrsquo in the s.The agricultural census of  recorded  of these lsquocarsrsquo in the  townlands of the south Ards alone.

","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest secured their spot in the semi-final stages of the Harry Clarke Cup after they dramatically defeated a favoured Ardglass side on Saturday.Despite trailing by two goals with less than five minutes left on the clock, Forest managed to force extra-time, and then penalties, following a bizarre conclusion to the  minutes that ended with a red card and a fairytale finish.Sean Dornan was the hero between the sticks in the shootout after saving two separate Ardglass efforts while converting his chance from the spot for good measure.To add further to the drama, Dornan was initially outfield for Forest before swapping positions with lsquokeeper Brian McVeigh a minute before the final whistle of extra-time sounded.It was a sunny yet bitterly cold Ardglass venue but that didnrsquot deter things from immediately heating up on the pitch as both teams sought to gain the upper hand early.However, it was the home side who would take the lead within the opening ten minutes when striker Michael Magee struck the ball into the net from close range.This lead would be short-lived as the visitors penned Ardglass back into their own half and soon Castlewellan were rewarded for their relentless attacking.A quickly played pass across the box was met by Forest forward Shane Mooney, who made no mistake with his right footed finish beyond the outstretched arms of Ardglass custodian Mark Armstrong.Chances followed for the visitors, including a Sean Dornan effort that cracked the outside of the post from range and an opportunity for striker Scott Kinley, which quickly diminished after he took too much time on the ball.However, Ardglass refused to be bullied for a prolonged period of time from a side a ision below in the Newcastle League and often launched some dangerous looking counterattacks.One such breakaway ended with Shane Teggart earning his Ardglass side a corner which led to a goalmouth scramble before the ball was headed off the line and away from danger.Ardglass began to find their feet and found more success up front thanks to the probing runs of marksman Magee, who was giving the Castlewellan defence plenty to think about.The Ardglass number nine was unfortunate to see his free-kick effort saved at the second time of asking, but he did give his side the chance to go in front when his nty footwork inside the Forest box resulted in a mistimed tackle and a penalty awarded.Stephen Deegan stepped up a coolly dispatched the spot kick, sending Castlewellan custodian Brian McVeigh the opposite direction in the process.Castlewellan continued to battle with Donagh Steele in the middle of the park having a particularly notable performance as he chased down every loose ball available.Despite their good work, Forest may count themselves fortunate not to go into the break further behind as the usually clinical Magee fluffed his lines from ten yards, missing a golden opportunity for Ardglass.The drama of the first half carried onto the second and in a matter of minutes the referee was forced to make another potentially game changing decision.Once again, the hosts released Magee into the danger area although this time he had Castlewellan captain Aidan Dornan hot on his heels.The move ended with Magee on the ground with his hands in the air appealing for a penalty, however, this time appeals were swtly waved off.The contest quickly turned into a feisty affair as Ardglass looked to overrun their counterparts by sending bodies forward in waves of attacks.Jordan Finnegan saw his snapshot smartly saved by Forest lsquokeeper McVeigh before strike partner Magee saw another one of his efforts tipped wide by the impressive Castlewellan number one.Midway through the half Castlewellan were afforded a seldom opportunity, but Sean Dornan opted to pass when he maybe should have tried his luck at goal instead.Soon after, a punt upfield from the Ardglass defence evaded the heads of the opposition, including lsquokeeper McVeigh, and almost resulted in a rather comedic goal.However, the Castlewellan defence recovered just in the nick of time to avoid any red faces.With  minutes left of the , Ardglass would finally add to their tally after a sumptuous dead ball delivery from Neil Teggart lofted onto the head of team-mate Malachy Crangle, who directed his effort into the net.Castlewellan knew the clock was against them but firmly pushed for a way back into the tie. Rossa McCartan was introduced to the fray off the bench in what proved to be a decisive move from Castlewellan head coach Conall Burns.With a minute of regulation time to go, McCartan danced his way down the line and into the Ardglass box where he was adjudged to be brought down unfairly.Forest striker Mooney converted the penalty to notch his second goal of the match but there was little belief from the surrounding spectators that there would be enough time for another opportunity.In what was seemingly one last throw of the dice, Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick inside their own half and players gathered at the edge of the opposing -yard line waiting for the delivery.However, before the free-kick could be taken, some roughhousing from both sides would end with Ardglass substitute Aidan Watson being shown the red card after he seemingly lost his discipline and kicked out at the opposition.A bizarre series would follow, as the initial free-kick was then brought forward to the -yard line where Watson committed his foul, and from here Castlewellan would take full advantage.Sean Dornan struck his lowly driven effort beneath the jumping Ardglass wall, and goalkeeper Mark Armstrong could only momentarily ert the ball away from goal before the onrushing Callum McCabe would tap-in to draw the sides level.With that, the final whistle of regulation time was blown and extra-time was set to commence.To both sidersquos credit, the intensity of the match remained but neither manufactured any real clear cut chances.Ardglass striker Magee picked up a yellow card but the most notable move of extra-time came from the Castlewellan management, whoopted to swap midfielder Sean Dornan for goalkeeper McVeigh a minute before the penalty shootout.This would prove decisive as Dornan broke Ardglass hearts and saved two penalties, giving his Castlewellan side a memorable victory and place in the last four of the Harry Clarke Cup.Following the dramatic encounter, Dornan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe were low on numbers coming down here and we probably werenrsquot as strong as we could be, he said.ldquoBut the credit has to go to the boys, we worked hard and it worked out for us.ldquoWe went - down but we battled hard, got a penalty and a fluky goal.He added: ldquoThe Harry Clarke Cup is blown wide open, Ardglass was probably the favourites and we knocked them out so itrsquos anyones now.Ardglass: M Armstrong, C Kearney, M Crangle, N Teggart, C OrsquoShea, M Rooney , S Deegan, SP Halpin, M Magee, J Finnegan, S Teggart.Subs: S Dorrian, A Watson, J Deegans, A OrsquoShea.Yellow card: M MageeRed card: A WatsonCastlewellan: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, A Dornan , D Gilmore, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, S Kinley, J Murnin.Subs: C McVeigh, R McCartan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  March 11%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash Work has begun on the first phase of a major agricultural marketing centre for the Downpatrick area.Diggers moved in this week to begin excavating a ten-acre site for a co-operative project which is being seen as essential to the future of the local farming community.A pound, livestock mart will form the first stage of an ambitious scheme by the Downpatrick Co-Operative Marketing Centre, a limited company which has been set up by more than  local farmers.A covered sale yard and ancillary buildings on the Bonecastle Road site are expected to be finished in time for trading to begin by late July.

The extension of the scheme sends a strong message of the important contribution of the small business sector.Last month, Newry, Mourne and Down Council imposed a .% rates rise to finance its poundm budget, with the hike the second lowest increase of any of the provincersquos  local authorities.Rates are made up of two parts mdash the regional rate and the district rate.The regional rate is set by Stormont and, along with the block grant from the Treasury, pays for the likes of schools, health and roads. The district rate is set by local councils and pays for services that the council is responsible for, such as refuse collection, leisure provision and street cleaning.While councils have the power to set dferent rates increases for households and businesses, this year they have chosen to instead set one percentage increase for both.Domestic and non-domestic rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation of homes and businesses by the combined district and regional rate.Domestic and non-domestic rates are set in terms of the number of pence in each pound of the value of your home business. For instance, in the Newry, Mourne and Down council area, the domestic rate for the   financial year is . pence, while the non-domestic rate will be . pence.Key factors that councils have to take into account when setting their district rate, including cost of living, inflation, the councilrsquos own financial reserves and other income, and the wider economic outlook.Last year, several councils chose to freeze their rates due to the impact of the pandemic, dipping into their reserves to absorb the loss of income. Others chose to raise their rates slightly, however this has meant playing a degree of catch-up this year, when all councils have opted to hike their rates.As a result of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos rates increase, local communities are set to share a poundm funding boost in the new financial year.The organisation said it recognises that communities have been hit hard over the past number of years, outlining plans for poundm of financial assistance grants for community and voluntary organisations.In addition, the local authority will also manage the establishment of the Peace Plus Partnership as well as the submission and delivery of the Peace Plus Local Authority Action Plan worth around poundm.The action plan will provide priority projects on a cross-community basis, resulting in shared and inclusive local services, facilities and spaces and make a ldquosignicant and lasting contribution to peace and reconciliation for the whole community.In addition, pound.m will be invested on a new fleet of over  modern and more efficient vehicles across a range of services including refuse collection, district cleansing and parks and grounds maintenance with the new vehicles expected to arrive before the end of this year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Sense have been at  the core of Páuric’s  development and they have done a lot for us  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman braved the winds and rain last month to walk  miles in aid of the disability charity, Sense.Janine Laverty was inspired to take on Sensersquos Run For challenge to give back to the charity which supports her disabled son.So far Janine has raised an amazing total of over pound, through her challenge, but she is aiming to raise pound, in total.Participants challenged themselves to run or walk a distance of their choosing over the month of February.Janine finished her -mile target on February , completing her challenge with a seaside walk.She undertook the walk to support the charity which has meant so much to her family since her youngest son Paacuteuric, , was born premature and has cerebral palsy, developmental delay and dficulties with his vision.Family and friends have rallied around Janine , joining her on walks and generously donating to Sense.Sense services in Northern Ireland have supported Paacuteuric since he was an infant, providing key interventions such as play therapy, music therapy and guide dog days which boosted his development.Janine also credits Sense with providing some of her most precious family memories support from the charity allowed her to take both her sons swimming at the same time, and the family have attended fun-filled Sense days out to places including Ark Open Farm, Armagh Planetarium and Jungle Northern Ireland.Janine explained: ldquoSense Northern Ireland have been at the core of Paacuteuricrsquos development and they have done an awful lot for us.

In the current situation that is just not possible, he said.ldquoThe only way for people to get out is through the only UK embassy open in Lviv and how are people are meant top get there when they canrsquot leave their own towns without the risk of being bombed Mr Johnston added that he and his we and their children, Liza and Jamie, were frustrated that their family members could be just one plane flight away from safetythey could get the necessary visa, orthat could be waived in the urgent circumstances.He said: ldquoWe are worried aboutthe possibility of Alexander being coned to fight and we are getting reports that landmines have been set around the city.ldquoWhile we are all worried, Iryna has been remarkable throughout all of this and has been really strong but we feel that there is very little we can do.Mr Johnston said that they were in despair of the UKrsquos stance in welcoming Ukrainian refugees but still making them apply for visas.ldquoThe south of Ireland opened up to refugees visa-free which is great but that means we still couldnrsquot bring them to our home as they would be in UK territory.He and his family visited Mariupol for six weeks last summer as it has already proved dficult for his mother-in-law to get a visa to travel to them.ldquoMariupol is such a beautul city. They had spent so much money on the city and now itrsquos ruined.The couple met in Ukraine while Mr Johnston, a flutist, was performing in cruise ships and his we was a concert pianist.To sign the petition to waive visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees coming into the UK visit https:petition.parliament.uk petitions ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":null,"title":"latest","story":"Undefined component: AdRowTaboolaNews Covid- Travel Restrictions to be removed in Northern Ireland from March  Gemma MurrayPolitics Watch as Sinn Fein take part in tree planting ceremony for Queen’s Jubilee Graeme Cousins do it all’\" href\" business consumer a-good-business-leader-knows-you-dont-and-cant-do-it-all-\" do it all’\" href\" business consumer a-good-business-leader-knows-you-dont-and-cant-do-it-all-\"Consumer do it all’\" href\" business consumer a-good-business-leader-knows-you-dont-and-cant-do-it-all-\" A good business leader knows ‘you don’tdo it all’ Dr Scott KingConsumer Livestream funerals helps families say goodbye from anywhere in the world Claire CartmillPolitics Northern Ireland Protocol: Jamie Bryson in call for non-violent protest By The NewsroomPeople Homes for Ukraine Scheme Northern Ireland explained Sarah McCann, Search and Trends Writer News When is Red Nose Day   Sarah McCann, Search and Trends WriterCrime PSNI come under attack overnight at ongoing security alert Gemma Murray Jim Allister, Kate Hoey and Ben Habib arrive at the High Court in Belfast, where a judgment is expected in the challenge to the Northern Ireland Protocol.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Kymin in Beach Road is currently empty, but the Vale of Glamorgan council plans to run the building in a similar way to the Pier Pavilion, which it took over last year and refurbished.The Vale council previously let the Kymin to Penarth Town Council. But after a funding dispute, the lease ended and the Vale planned to sell off the building on a long lease, possibly as a restaurant or hotel.After a public backlash the council performed a U-turn last summer and dropped the plans. Now council bosses have suggested the building could be used for business meetings, open-air theatre, community fairs, weddings, and food festivals.Plans are already underway to host productions this summer of Peter Pan, Pirates of Penzance, and a Midsummer Night’s Dream. Council bosses welcomed the progress during a cabinet meeting on Monday, March .Cllr Kathyrn McCaffer, cabinet member for leisure, arts and culture, said the initial refurbishment work includes making the building safe and protected from wind and rain.She said: “We’re investing to make sure the building stays watertight and secure and is fit for purpose. We have a great relationship with a couple of local community groups who are already using the grounds of the Kymin, which is really encouraging.”Since the Pavilion reopened in April last year, after the council took it over, the building has brought in an extra £, income from the cafe, cinema screenings, weddings and art sales. The building has hosted events for Halloween, Christmas, arts and crafts, and carols.Cllr Peter King, cabinet member for neighbourhood services and transport, said the council took the Pavilion on from the charity which used to run it “at the most challenging time” yet now the building is making money for the council.He said: “The previous organisation failed to make a financial success of operating the Pavilion and frankly ended in a bit of a mess. It defaulted back to us as the landlord, and it came to us at the most challenging time you could imagine for any business or organisation..remove“And yet we have managed to turn things around, despite all those restraints of lockdown, and we’re reporting what can only be described as a successful community facility—and one that has produced a financial surplus.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She is a member of GSD Dog Club of Wales Training Club and receives support from professional mentors.Luca, who also qualied for Crufts  but failed the last challenge, was unstoppable in this years event - winning the competition and being awarded a trophy.“It’s a long process to qualy for Crufts,” said husband Mr Heath.“This is the second time Luca has qualied and he nailed everything this year.“He came in first place and was asked to stay behind to do a demonstration in the ring – we are really happy.“It was a long day, but worthwhile.”The trio travelled from Wenvoe and stayed at a bed and breakfast ahead of the event so Luca could have his time to shine in the prestigious competition.“I was the most nervous watching the final exercise,” added Mr Heath.“Carolyn doesn’t look at the score as she doesn’t want the pressure so – although she knew she was doing well – she didn’t know that she was winning.”Although the trio had to head back to Wenvoe after the competition, Mr Heath had anticipated the day would go well so had a bottle ready – meaning Ms Heath could enjoy a celebratory bubbly on their travels.Due to Luca’s success in Crufts  he has automatically qualied for the event in .And –all goes as planned – it is hoped that Luca and his female friend Eva, will be welcoming puppies into the world later this year and that Eva will qualy for Crufts in a few years time. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAmerican forensic musicologist Anthony Ricigliano concluded in a report for alegal row that it was “objectively unlikely” that any similarities between the  track and the song Oh Why by Sami Chokri “result from copying”.But Christian Siddell, another musicologist, reported that he found melodic similarities were “so numerous and striking that the possibility of independent creation is… highly improbable”.Mr Sheeran and his co-writers, Snow Patrol’s John McDaid and producer Steven McCutcheon, deny that Shape Of You copies part of the  song by Mr Chokri – a grime artist who performs under the name Sami Switch.Mr Chokri and his co-writer Ross O’Donoghue claim that a central “Oh I” hook in Mr Sheeran and his co-authors’ track is “strikingly similar” to an “Oh Why” refrain in their own composition. vw,vw,px, px\"Sami Chokri Both musicology experts gave evidence on their analysis of the songs at an ongoing trial in London on Wednesday.In a joint written statement, they agreed that “when heard in the context of their respective works, the words ‘Oh why’ and ‘Oh I’ may be phonetically indistinguishable from each other to the casual listener”.They also agreed that neither of them had found “the same combination of either the ‘Oh Why’ phrase – combined phonetic sound plus pitch and rhythm – nor the ‘Oh I’ phrase – combined phonetic sound plus pitch and rhythm – in any other compositions”.Lawyers for Mr Chokri and Mr O’Donoghue allege that when the two songs’ melodies are transposed into the same key “the progression of notes is the same”.They also claim the rhythm of the tracks’ melodies are “almost identical”, their use of instrumentation “creates a strikingly similar sound and texture” and the vowel sounds in the chanted tune “further enhances the similarity”..remove vw,vw,px, px\"Songwriter John McDaid Mr Ricigliano, who was instructed by the Shape Of You co-writers’ lawyers but told the court he was “completely impartial”, said in a report that he considered the extent of the alleged similarities between the two songs to be “overstated”.He wrote that “the overall design and musical development of the melodic, harmonic and lyrical content in the relevant phrase in Shape Of You are distinctively dferent from that utilised in Oh Why”.Mr Ricigliano added: “Such similarities as there are, when placed in context, in my view lack signicance in relation to the allegation of copying from Oh Why.“They are commonplace forms of expression, both in terms of use by other writers and by Mr Sheeran himself.“My view is therefore that it is objectively unlikely that any similarities result from copying.”In court, Andrew Sutclfe QC, representing Mr Chokri and Mr O’Donoghue, asked him: “You accept, don’t you Mr Ricigliano, that despite all your research you have not found any examples in any corner of the earth over the past  years which sound phonetically the same as the chorus in Oh Why and the post chorus in Shape Of You.” vw,vw,px, px\"Ed Sheeran outside the High Court “That’s correct,” Mr Ricigliano said.“Do you not find this extraordinary ” Mr Sutclfe asked, with the expert replying: “No”.The barrister described the two song phrases as appearing “within months of each other” and suggested they sound “almost the same”.“I would disagree with the characterisation,” Mr Ricigliano said, adding that the two are “coincidentally similar” and have “distinctive dferences”.Mr Sheeran has argued in his written evidence that his song’s Oh I phrase uses “a basic minor pentatonic pattern” which is “entirely commonplace”.In court, Mr Siddell, who was instructed by Mr Chokri and Mr O’Donoghue’s lawyers but outlined his own professional opinion in his report, said he felt there had been “over emphasis” in relation to references to the minor pentatonic scale in the case, adding: “The Oh I and Oh Why phrases are melodies not scales.”In his own report he concluded that there were “striking and substantial similarities between certain aspects of the lead vocal melody of Oh Why and Shape Of You”.He said the two melodies were “nearly identical in respect of their rhythm and pitch”, the phonetic sounds of the vocal lines were “musically indistinguishable to the ear” and other compositional similarities included the use of “phrase repetition” and “the musical dynamics”.Mr Siddell said that similarities between the two works were “unlikely to be the consequence of coincidence”.“From a solely musical perspective, I find the melodic similarities to be so numerous and striking that the possibility of independent creation is in my view highly improbable,” he said.He added: “Had I been consulted in a ‘ compliance’ capacity as to whether a licence should be sought from the writers of Oh Why, my guidance would have been, in summary, that either the melodic phrase should be omitted and replaced with original new material or a licence should be obtained.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Experts give contrasting views on Sheeran us Shape Of You attrial article_url

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Prime Minister was visiting the Gulf state and its neighbour, the United Arab Emirates, on Wednesday, while trying to wean the West off Russian energy in response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.But Mr Johnson downplayed his chances of securing greater oil production from the Middle East in an attempt to lessen the severity of the cost-of-living crisis facing the UK.Mr Johnson smiled and warmly shook hands with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman when arriving at the royal court in Riyadh, days after the largest mass execution in the kingdom in modern history.At his first stop in Abu Dhabi, Mr Johnson insisted he has raised the two countries’ poor human rights records “many, many times”, adding: “I’ll raise them all again today.”He pointed towards Saudi Arabia announcing a £ billion investment in green aviation fuel in Teesside.“That’s the kind of thing we want to encourage – doesn’t in any way mean we can’t stick to our principles and raise those issues that we all care about,” he told broadcasters from under the rapidly warming sun on a terrace at the Emirates Palace hotel.But he appeared pessimistic that he would be able to open up the spare capacity of the Saudi-led Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countriesto soften the blow of esting from Russian fossil fuels. vw,vw,px, px\"Boris Johnson arrives for a media interview at the Emirates Palace hotel in Abu Dhabi “It’s not just a question of looking at the Opec countries and what they can do to increase supply, though that is important. There’s also the issue of Emirati investment in UK wind farms, already huge – what more can they do ” he said.“When we look at the dependency the West in particular has built up on Putin’s hydrocarbons, on Putin’s oil and gas, we can see what a mistake that was, because he’s been able to blackmail the West and hold western economies to ransom..remove“We need independence.”Mr Johnson pledged that his long-awaited energy strategy will come “next week” and include a “massive jump forward on renewables, more nuclear, using our own hydrocarbons more effectively” and sourcing fuel from outside Russia.However, Downing Street’s account of the meeting with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed did not say whether the Prime Minister raised human rights concerns with the UAE’s crown prince. vw,vw,px, px\"Boris Johnson inspects the Guard of Honour as he arrives at Abu Dhabi airport Nor did it contain any indication Mr Johnson secured any kind of commitment on increasing oil production.A No  spokesman said: “The Prime Minister set out his deep concerns about the chaos unleashed by Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and stressed the importance of working together to improve stability in the global energy market.”The Prime Minister’s official spokesman told reporters that the “PM raised human rights issues”, but added “I don’t have any more details”, leaving open to interpretation the extent to which they discussed abuses.Critics have particularly questioned the move to strengthen ties with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with the Saudi leader implicated in the assassination of US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi in .Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said “going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is not an energy strategy”. vw,vw,px, px\"Boris Johnson is welcomed by Mohammed bin Salman ahead of a meeting at the royal court in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Conservative MPs and human rights watchdogs are among those calling on the Prime Minister to question the countries on their track records, after Saudi Arabia executed on Saturday  people convicted of crimes ranging from killings to belonging to militant groups.The state-run Saudi Press Agency said three more iniduals had been executed on the day of Mr Johnson’s visit.Maya Foa, the director of human rights advocacy group Reprieve, said: “By travelling to meet Mohammed bin Salman so soon after a mass execution, Boris Johnson clearly signalled that infor oil, the UK will tolerate even the gravest human rights abuses.“Carrying out these executions while the leader of a western power is on Saudi soil was a provocative act, designed to flaunt the Crown Prince’s power and impunity to the world.”Mohammed bin Salman has largely been shunned by the West after US intelligence alleged he ordered the murder of Mr Khashoggi at the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul, something the Saudi ruler denies.🚨BREAKING: Saudi Arabia executed  more people this morning during @BorisJohnsons visit.Travelling to Saudi Arabia after a mass execution signaled the UK will tolerate the gravest human rights abuses. Today’s executions are the immediate result. Johnson has blood on his hands— ReprieveMarch , One person who did embrace him, however, was the Russian president, with the prince and Mr Putin sharing a high-five and a laugh at a G summit in the month after Mr Khashoggi’s death.Mr Johnson has argued he needs to “build the widest possible coalition” to address Mr Putin’s attack on Ukraine.Conservative MP Julian Lewis, who chairs Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee, called on the Government to ensure that “in seeking to lessen our dependence upon one source of oil and gas, we do not end up creating a source dependency on another unreliable and sometimes hostile regime”.Mr Johnson, who travelled overnight before beginning the trip in the UAE on Wednesday, is being joined by investment minister Lord Grimstone..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: PM to  ustick to principles u amid claims he is going from  udictator to dictator u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I’m the elder brother of Columba McVeigh who was abducted and murdered in . He was  years old. His body has never found. “Columba’s remains lie somewhere in the Monaghan bogland where he was killed over  years ago. He was named as one of the so called Disappeared  years after his murder. Despite enormous efforts over that time by the The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims’ Remains my brother is one of three people from that troubled past who has not been found. The other two missing persons are Joe Lynskey, who was abducted and murdered in  and Captain Robert Nairac, GC, who was abducted and murdered in .“During that passage of time from my brother’s disappearance until the revelation that he was murdered, my father and mother passed on never truly knowing the circumstances of their son’s disappearance and death. And most importantly to them, the ultimate indignity of Columba being denied a Christian burial. “Like many here tonight my family’s greatest pain over time has been the one of feeling helpless in the face of such an atrocity. We have been hurt and at times very angry too when reflecting of the injustice and brutality Inflicted on Columba. Perhaps not unlike how we all feel today at the brutal events in Ukraine. “But as iniduals and as a community our strength lies in dealing with that pain and the personal tragedies of that past.“That’s why I’m grateful to be present in this magnicent cathedral tonight and to stand with you who know what pain and hurt and loss is really about. This Lenten period is often referred to as the long walk towards Caly. I take comfort in walking with all of you present this evening. “Each year in spring the families of the disappeared attend a commemoration Mass in Armagh. We give thanks for those found and for the last missing three souls. Each year the families receive a candle to remember their loved ones for who have been found and those souls who are still missing. “This year I will be remembering two of the last remaining lost victims. My brother of course but also Captain Robert Nairac. In  while in Afghanistan filming a documentary on The Grenadier Guards, I spent some considerable time with several officers who fatherswho had served with Capt. Nairac, himself a Grenadier Officer. I resolved at that time to honour his memory. “I finally hope to bring the candle I was privileged to accepton behalf of the family of Capt. Nairac and place it in the Oratory of his former college at Ampleforth in England. “So just as tonight we remember all those who perished during our long conflict, we also remember the families and friends left behind to deal with the aftermath of these brutal events of the past. Tonight, in this place of prayer we honour our living and our deceased.” Shane Lavertywho was murdered on the Antrim road, Belfast by Provisional IRA terrorists in  commented: “I felt privileged to have been asked to do the first reading in this very poignant service. As I stepped up to the lectern, I bowed my head and quietly spoke the words “for Robert”. Then as I looked out over a sea of expectant faces, I could silently hear each one say the name of a loved one cruelly taken by senseless violent iniduals”.“We are in a cycle of  years of th anniversaries, but truthfully, for us, each family occasion is an anniversary! The events of  changed the lives of very many families”.“On Friday night, we remembered the silent sacrice. No big headlines, no multi-million-pound inquiry, just dignied, prayerful and loving thoughts for innocents, lost!”Meanwhile Richard Bell, survivor of an assassination bid upon him, his Dad and brother Robin which resulted in the murder of his brother Pte Robin Bellin Newtownbutler, County Fermanagh remarked:“The Service was deeply important for my family, I felt that the experiences of our family and so many others were validated”.“There was a lot of pain and unresolved injustice in that Church building but the Service was also uplting and there was a real sense of Hope that ran through proceedings”.“It is important for my family that the Churches walk with us and beside us”.Robin was murdered by Provisional IRA terrorists and he read a prayer at the Service.Robert Nairac  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularLaura Marshall murder: CCTV footage of Lurgan woman’s final ...News‘Zombie’ claim Larne man is jailed for killing his grandmoth...NewsAll set for St Patricks Day parade in Cookstown...News£, reward still stands as milk carton bandits strike aga...NewsPolice officers and member of the public hospitalised after ...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
