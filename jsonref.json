More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics europe s turning point","story":"Russia\u0027s invasion of Ukraine has brought about enormous changes in European policy in an incredibly short space of time.

the corporation issued instructions on how to get around the country\u0027s ban on its reporting.The Russian government has restricted independent and foreign news as part of an information blackout following its invasion of Ukraine, including blocking BBC websites and its world news channel from broadcasting in the country.At lunchtime on Sunday BBC World News presenter Victoria Derbyshire told viewers: BBC World News, the channel you are watching if you are outside the UK right now, and which is the BBC\u0027s global television news channel, has just been taken off air in Russia.A spokesman said: \u0027\u0027We can confirm that since Saturday BBC World News has not been available in Russia.\u0027Denied access to impartial news\u0027We regret that our Russian audiences are being denied access to trusted and impartial news at a time when they need it most.The suspension of the corporation\u0027s global channel followed a ban on the BBC website last week.In response to the crackdown the BBC has issued instructions on how to use anonymising browsers and mobile phone apps designed to circumvent censorship.It encouraged people to use Tor, computer software which is designed to obscure the location and identifying details of people browsing the internet.The software has a dedicated BBC site which users can access via mobile phone apps including the Tor Browser or Onion Browser, both of which can be downloaded from Apple or Google\u0027s app stores.Tor, originally developed by the US Naval Research Laboratory, has made headlines because of its use for illicit purposes such as drug trafficking on the dark web.But it is also a valuable tool for people in countries which monitor and control online communications, allowing them to access censored sources of information.The BBC originally launched its Tor service in 2019, including foreign-language services in Russian, Persian and Arabic. Countries including China, Iran and Vietnam have previously blocked access to the corporation\u0027s journalism.Shortwave broadcastsThe BBC has also relaunched its shortwave radio service, used extensively during the Second World War and Cold War, in an effort to reach people trying to access news from inside Ukraine or Russia.Shortwave broadcasts can travel long distances and be accessed from portable radios, making them ideal for wartime information. The corporation abandoned its shortwave channel in 2008 as listeners turned instead to satellite and digital sources, but it has relaunched it in response to the conflict.On Friday BBC bosses said they were temporarily suspending the work of journalists in Russia amid a crackdown on free speech which has made it a criminal offence punishable by up to 15 years in prison to spread fake or false news about the war in Ukraine.Tim Davie, the BBC’s director-general, said the legislation “appears to criminalise the process of independent journalism.He said the corporation\u0027s Russian-language service would continue to operate from outside Russia.US outlets CNN and CBS News said they would stop broadcasting in the country while other publications said they would remove journalists\u0027 bylines to protect them.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Vladimir Putin blames Kyiv for failed Mariupol ceasefireFracking could return as firms research methods to reduce earthquakes amid energy fearsIn this dangerous new cold war, we need strength and sense to prevailCrufts flyball event ‘cruel’ as it doubles risk of injury to dogs, scientists say\u0026#39Our sons were sent to Ukraine as cannon fodder\u0026#39: Furious Russian mothers face down KremlinBritain poised to expand defence spending as Russia’s failures in Ukraine raise eyebrowsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bristol cathedral plaque mark first women priests named men","story":"Bristol Cathedral is to replace a plaque commemorating the first female priests because the original version only names the men who ordained them.The cathedral is swapping its 1994 memorial with an updated version - engraved with the names of the first 32 women to be ordained as part of Women\u0027s History Month.While the current plaque pays tribute to the historic occasion, it only names the bishop, precentor and dean - all of whom were male.It reads: “In this Cathedral on 12 March 1994 Barry Rogerson, Bishop of Bristol, ordained the first women as priests in the Church of England. John Simpson: Precentor. Wesley Carr: Dean.”The updated memorial is inscribed with similar wording but is surrounded by the names of each of the 32 women.The new inscription reads: “To the Glory of God, these 32 women were the first to be ordained as priests in the Church of England by the Bishop of Bristol, Barry Rogerson, in this Cathedral on 12th March 1994.”Falls during Women\u0027s History MonthThe plaque will be unveiled at a Holy Communion service on March 12 by the Rt Rev Vivienne Faull, the Bishop of Bristol.The date marks not only the 28th anniversary of the ordination service but also aptly falls during Women\u0027s History Month.Bishop Faull said: “It is wonderful to be gathering for this special occasion with a service of Holy Communion.“There is a certain irony that it has taken us 28 years to unveil a plaque that mentions the names of those pioneering women ordained in Bristol Cathedral all those years ago.“But I hope and pray that the progress that this represents will be a mark of wider progress in the standing of women in the Church and indeed our reaching out to all marginalised or under-represented groups.”The Rev Angela Berners-Wilson was one of the first women to be ordained in 1994.She added: “I am very much looking forward to being back in Bristol Cathedral in March, 28 years to the day after our ordination as the first group of women to be priested in the Church of England.“It will be very special to have all our 32 names included on a new plaque to be put up in the cathedral as the original one only included the bishop and dean.” Stonemason Robyn Golden-HannThe new plaque was commissioned by the Cathedral Chapter and is being carved by stonemason Robyn Golden-Hann. Speaking for the cathedral, the Dean of Bristol, the Very Rev Dr Mandy Ford, said: It\u0027s interesting that this has become a story.We are really only correcting what should have been done in 1994.We are honouring the women who were ordained that day by repairing an omission which was made at the time.It\u0027s good that we can make this correction - it is a celebration of women\u0027s ministry.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Boris Johnson condemns \u0026#39barbaric attacks\u0026#39 on civilians in call with Volodymyr ZelenskyCrufts flyball event ‘cruel’ as it doubles risk of injury to dogs, scientists say\u0026#39Our sons were sent to Ukraine as cannon fodder\u0026#39: Furious Russian mothers face down KremlinBritain poised to expand defence spending as Russia’s failures in Ukraine raise eyebrowsSex traffickers exploit Ukrainian refugees as dark side of exodus to Europe emergesSurge in food prices beckons to pay for soaring foreign worker wagesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cooking reading lifes great healers","story":"Two years ago, the Ukrainian food writer, Olia Hercules, published her third cookbook, Summer Kitchens. The title refers to the traditional small buildings in the gardens of Ukrainian homes where families gather to cook, preserve and eat their garden produce during the hot summer months.Evocative photographs of these eccentrically lovely structures accompanied hearty recipes such as lazy dumplings with green beans, poppy seeds and crispy shallots, and slow-roast pork with sauerkraut and dried fruit. “The book,” wrote the Daily ’s reviewer, “is a lesson in what it is to be Ukrainian”.The idea that food is not just the stuff that keeps us going, but the stuff of our very identity is to be found endlessly explored in the recipe books of cooks who are also talented writers.In her memoir with recipes, Orchards in the Oasis, Josceline Dimbleby recalled her seven-year-old self’s Damascene revelation, when the cook at her family home (her father was Minister at the British Legation in Damascus) offered her a delicate pastry: “That was the moment…which kindled my lifelong passion for food and flavour”.Cairo-born Claudia Roden was a 20-year-old student in London during the Suez crisis of 1956. Collecting the recipes eventually published as A Book of Middle Eastern Food became an antidote to feelings of exile: “For me,” she said, “history was personal.”For all of us, whether or not we have suffered the misery of conflict, the food we grew up eating becomes an inseparable part of who we are. (This is often, but not always, a pleasure: along with fond recollections of my mother’s epic Sunday roasts, the sickly Kentish speciality, Gypsy Tart - a school dinner staple - remains an emetic memory.)The actor Stanley Tucci, who lost his ability to eat during cancer treatment, wrote in his memoir, Taste, of the intimate connection between food, creativity and love: “Food was not just a huge part of my life: it basically was my life.”It is this sentiment that has united Olia Hercules with her old friend, the UK-based Russian chef, Alissa Timoshkina, to launch the charity, Cook for Ukraine, with donations going to Unicef.Amid the horror of war, they say, “Food is a symbol of people coming together”. Those of us who watch the news in shock and dread now have the opportunity to make a modest gesture of support, nourishing body and soul while learning something of what it means to be Ukrainian.Shirley Hughes leaves a remarkable legacyAnyone who learned to love books in early childhood has a mental library of stories and pictures so ingrained that they seem not acquired but innate, like language itself.My own list includes Babar, Orlando the Marmalade Cat, and Shirley Hughes’s illustrations for Dorothy Edwards’s enchanting My Naughty Little Sister series. Thirty years after I first read them, they had a new lease of life as bedtime stories for my small son.Hughes’s death at the age of 94 is a painful loss for her family but what an enduring monument she created in her humane, funny and finely observed accounts of the jeopardy and consolations of childhood.Interviewed in 1978, she said, “I think that a good picture book is a complete world.” So it was for the first readers of Dogger, Alfie, and her many other books. And so it will remain, for many generations of children and grandchildren to come.More from NewsFracking could return as firms research methods to reduce earthquakes amid energy fearsIn this dangerous new cold war, we need strength and sense to prevailRussia-Ukraine latest news: Boris Johnson condemns \u0026#39barbaric attacks\u0026#39 on civilians in call with Volodymyr ZelenskyCrufts flyball event ‘cruel’ as it doubles risk of injury to dogs, scientists say\u0026#39Our sons were sent to Ukraine as cannon fodder\u0026#39: Furious Russian mothers face down KremlinBritain poised to expand defence spending as Russia’s failures in Ukraine raise eyebrowsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"11 ways tory cost living","story":" ways Tory cost-of-living crisis will squeeze your family next monthEnergy bills are rising along with National Insurance, Council Tax, rail fares and inflation - while other help is frozen, wages suffer a real-terms cut and you have to pay for Covid tests.

Wages for teachers and NHS staff, benefits and pensions are all set to rise by less than inflation, leaving you with less disposable income. And those paying student loans are hit with a aposstealthapos rise. Tory ministers announced a £ council tax discount this April for people in Band A-D homes in England. But it won’t touch the sides of the energy bills price rise, let alone all other squeezes as the country starts paying for Covid.  Another £ “rebate” is really just a loan that has to be paid back out of future bills and won’t arrive until October. The minimum wage for over-s is rising from £. to £. an hour, but could also be cancelled out by the squeeze. Boris Johnson is currently avoiding much political pain over the price rises due to the focus on the war in Ukraine.But that won’t stop them hitting your wallet or your family… . Energy bills Regulator Ofgem confirmed the energy price cap will increase to a record £, for a typical household following soaring gas prices. Around million Brits on iable tarfs will be hit with a £ rise to the average annual bill overnight on April . Those on fixed tarfs will be hit by rises when their fixed-rate period ends. Rishi Sunak has announced plans to help, which include people living in bands A to D getting £ discount on their council tax in England, and a £ rebate off energy bills in October.But Labour has branded him the loan shark Chancellor as the rebate is effectively a loan which will need to be repaid over five years. The discount will be clawed back from people’s bills in equal £ instalments from . Pressure will build on the Government to act again in October, when a second hike is expected. The Chancellor admitted annual bills could rise more than £, this year.  . National Insurance riseFrom April, a £bn rise in National Insurance will hit working people as the Treasury looks to cut Covid backlogs in the NHS and begin funding social care.It will mean that employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay .p more in the pound for National Insurance from April  - from % to .%. A worker on £, a year pays an extra £ in tax. Someone on £, will pay £ more. People earning under £, a year, or £ a month, will not have to pay National Insurance or the new levy. Those supportive of Boris Johnson argue the levy is progressive as the wealthier pay more. But Tory backbenchers hostile to new taxes baulk at the plans as the tax burden hits its highest in decades. . Inflation and interest rates UK inflation has hit .% and Britons are beginning to feel the squeeze as the cost of food, energy and transport rises at the fastest for three decades. This means the same pound in your pocket buys you less in bread or fuel.And both are products that could rise in price further due to the war between oil giant Russia and wheat-producing Ukraine. Meanwhile the Bank of England hiked interest rates earlier this month to .% in the first back-to-back increase since . This will mean mortgage rates become more expensive, an overnight rise to the monthly payments for people on standard iable rates.Mr Sunak insists inflation is a global problem post-Covid, but whether this line will hold remains to be seen.  . Council tax rise Most of England’s families will be hit with an eye-watering Council Tax rise of % or more in April, Mirror research reveals. The vast majority of cash-strapped town, city and county halls are imposing the maximum possible hike on April . Of  councils that run social care, the Mirror found  were planning rises of .% - the maximum normally allowed this year. And a further  planned rises higher than .%, by using allowances that were unused in previous years. Six of those authorities - Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Sandwell, Oxfordshire, Surrey and Rutland - are set to impose a .% hike. In Rutland that will raise a Band D bill by £, wiping out much of a £ discount that is meant to help pay rising energy bills. Search for your council tax rise by postcode below.  . Covid tests From April  the vast majority of people must paythey want a Covid lateral flow test - eventhey have a cough and fever. No has said spending £bn a month on free tests is not an effective use of taxpayers’ money at this point. This has prompted a furious row with Labour, some medics and the Scottish and Welsh governments - which will get no new moneythey want to continue free tests. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but No is seeking a regulated market where each test costs a low single-figure number of pounds. This suggests a box of seven could cost £-.Asymptomatic tests for NHS workers will be made available but not routinely, only as a surge effort where thereaposs an outbreak. But they will be available for care home residents. Exact lists of those eligible are being drawn up.. Student loans aposstealth taxapos Millions will be forced to pay more on their student loans under what has been branded a “stealth tax rise”. Student loan repayment thresholds will be frozen from April  after plans to raise them by .% were scrapped. That means graduates will have to shell out more of their disposable income as wages and prices rise with inflation. The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies warned the freeze will cost £k earners £ a year more than they expected. IFS senior economist Ben Waltmann said it was “a further hit to real incomes”, adding it “effectively constitutes a tax rise by stealth on graduates with middling earnings.” It gets worse further in the future. Students starting university next year will begin paying off their loans when they earn more than £, - down from the existing £,-a-year threshold. And theof time to repay their debt will be extended to  years, up from . The IFS said this will leave poorer graduates paying £, more over their letimes.  . Income tax goes up Rishi Sunak chose to freeze income tax thresholds at a time when inflation is climbing at frightening speed. Youaposll still pay % on earnings over £,, and % on earnings over £,, evenaverage wages rise. According to the Commons library, more than a million more people will be paying a higher rate of income tax by . It will also lead to around . million more workers having their earnings going over the % tax threshold and almost . million more people will be brought into paying the basic level of income tax. The Treasury can expect to net £bn from the move. But, when the impact arrives for Brits, calls from backbenchers for the Government to change course could grow. . Real terms cut to welfare and pensionsBenefits like Universal Credit and pension rates will both rise by .%, £. a month and £. a week respectively.Tory MPs pushed through the plans last month - saying it was in line with inflation. But it’s only in line with what inflation was last Autumn, before prices began to soar at an alarming rate. Meanwhile the pensions triple lock - which would have raised the state pension by more than % - was suspended. Many are warning that this will severely exacerbate the cost-of-living crisis for those who are struggling the most. Foodbank use is expected to climb as a result and the Government is no doubt braced for more interventions from high-profile campaigners such as Man U footballer Marcus Rashford.  . A real-terms cut to childcare help Poor parents will be hit hard by April’s cost-of-living crisis as Tory ministers refuse to raise a crucial childcare allowance - despite soaring inflation. Parents on Universal Credit can claim back % of childcare costs, but only up to a £.-a-month cap - which has not changed since  and is not rising in April. Campaigner and working mum to a four-year-old and Gemma Widdowfield, , told MPs: “We’re all in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis. We’re all feeling the pinch. “My childcare’s going up slightly but the Universal Credit cap isn’t going up at all… that’s going to be passed on to us.” . Real terms cuts to pay - including for NHS and teachers Inflation also means that many planned rises to public sector wages - which are due every April - will be wiped out by prices. Rising prices put huge pressure on the Chancellor to give these vital key workers pay rises above % or %, to avoid hitting them with a real-terms cut. But there are already clear signs the Treasury resisting such big cash rises. The government has spelt out plans to raise salaries for experienced teachers by only % in  . Health unions have also blasted plans to offer NHS staff in England a “miserly” % hike. . Rail fares Okay, we’re cheating here - this one has already come into effect. Rail passengers faced a ticket price nightmare as the steepest increases in almost a decade hit on March . According to industry body the Rail Delivery Group, people in England and Wales are set to shoulder the largest hike in rail ticket prices since January  with fares predicted to go up by .%. Labour has called the price hike brutal and campaign group Railfuture has accused Boris Johnsonaposs Government of “stoking the fire of the cost of living crisis” by enabling the increase.Ministers regulate rises in around half of fares including season tickets on most commuter routes.

The result reflects the world’s horror at the illegal actions of Vladimir Putin which has led to the slaughter of countless innocent lives.The words of condemnation must now be matched by a further tightening of the screw on Russian business and finance. The UK Government has acted swtly in cutting off banks and banning Russian planes from our airspace but has lagged behind the US and the EU in imposing other sanctions. Unlike Brussels we have still to freeze the assets of the members of the Russian Parliament. Dozens of Putin’s cronies and high-ranking military have yet to be targeted. The Tories have allowed London to become the world’s laundromat for Russian dirty money. They have also taken millions in donations from people with ties to the Kremlin. If they are serious about putting pressure on the Russian regime they should widen sanctions andthe donations. The longer they take to act, the more the suspicion grows that they are still in thrall to the oligarchs.  The best of us While Vladimir Putin has shown the worst of humanity with his brutal invasion, the public response to his vile actions has shown the best of humanity. Millions of people have donated to charities to help the people of Ukraine and the hundreds of thousands made homeless by the war. Some volunteers have even driven to the Polish-Ukrainian border to deliver much-needed medical supplies, food, clothes and toys for children. Their compassion has never been more necessary. A blood hound Hero dog Arnie is retiring after donating  pints of blood in his letime that have helped more than  other pets. Thankfully this real blood hound was not terrier-fied of needles.

They have discovered the most effective way to deliver viruses into our homes is by infecting porn sites with them. A former cyber spy told the Sunday Mirror: “One click on an enticing video is enough to introduce malware into your computer or mobile. “The advice for safe cyber sex is the same as for real sex - use protection.”  That means always accepting updates when offered which install the latest security software on devices to ward off denial of service attacks. Our critical infrastructure and most big companies now have sufficient safety measures in place to foil even state sponsored cyber aggressors. But despite that the National Cyber Security Centre recorded  attempted breaches last year as Russia, China, North Korea and Iran tried to infiltrate four in ten British businesses. But it is small firms and iniduals without any sophisticated protection who are most at risk. The only sure way to stop the spread of viruses is to follow Covid rules - and self-isolate. Keep all sensitive information on a laptop not linked to the internet so viruses cannot destroy it. And then use a second machine to go about your day to day business. Russia has already done something similar on a larger scale, as its internet network can be disconnected from the rest of the worldneeded. They tested it in January in readiness for cyber war.

It was about as useful as holding it over your head when the four-minute warning sounded. The Army bod’s stark message was that the horrors of post-Armageddon existence would be far, far worse than sudden death. It says everything about the seriousness of preparations for survival that civic responsibility for liaising on who got to go in the bunker and trivial things like which civilians might be shot – ­looters first – was passed down to the youngest, most junior member of the local authority. We all knew: they wouldn’t, would they  Couldn’t, surely wouldn’t. Follow all of of todayaposs news on the war in Ukraine as it unfolds with our live blog  That was then, when the Cold War was beginning to heat up in an arms race, with US missiles piling up on British soil, pointing at Moscow. Here we are again. Households flocking to buy DIY nuclear bunkers. This time it’s Vlad the Invader threatening “consequences the like of which you have never seen in your history”the West so much as dips a wingtip across the border to alleviate the suffering and torment of the Ukrainian innocents. Nuclear war. World War Three. But he wouldn’t, would he  Only a madman would contemplate… President Vladimir Putin might only be pretending to be mad to frighten Boris Johnson and our military masters in Washington.As he hides under his bottle-strewn desk in Number , Boris will take small comfort from the fact that the suffering of Ukraine will at least deflect from his own demise. For now. Charles Powell, Tony Blair’s chief of staff, says that the deranged, megalomanic, brutal dictator had always been “rational” until now, echoing the diplomatic comfort blanket clutched by the West that the Russian leader had always been “pragmatic”.  No light burns as bright as hindsight. But this is the President who all the while presided over a string of naked violations of international law, from annexing Crimea to bombing civilians in Syria, while London became the laundromat for oligarchs’ dodgy cash. The judo black belt who claims ­martial arts saved him from a le of “hooliganism” on the streets had been plotting thuggery on an international scale. For him, the fall of the Berlin Wall was a “catastrophe” for Russia, to be reversed by redrawing the former USSR borders. Boris Johnson is “confident” Putin will fail in his conquest of Ukraine. That’s when it gets tricky. In his twisted logic, Putin believes a world without Russia is a world not worth preserving. Pariah status, crippling economic isolation and “failure” are seen as an existential threat that’ll make him desperate. A year ago, Putin lowered the bar on the use of nuclear weapons. Maybe his new best mate, Xi Jinping in China, will be able to persuade him that a new world order with half the planet missing isn’t a good idea. God help us all, as we pretend war planners used to say. It’s worked so far.

Some girls picked it up before me and read it – and do you know what they did  They laughed. I didn’t think I was going to live past , yet now I’m a -year-old woman oiling my beard. Sometimes I wonder, “How did I get here ” I was born in London and grew up there with my mum, dad and younger brother. Outside of school, my upbringing was great. My parents took me to funfairs and theme parks, which I loved. We had picnics in the park, fun family nights and birthday parties, and we spent time with our cousins, having sleepovers. But when I wasn’t at home, it was hell on earth. The bullying started when I was in nursery school because I was a quiet, brown Sikh girl with long plaits, who was an easy target. And the more my body changed, the worse it got. When puberty hit, I gained a lot of weight. Then, when I was , I started growing hair around my throat.  My mum took me to the doctor for tests and at  I was diagnosed with polycystic oy syndrome, or PCOS, a condition that affects women’s hormone levels. Symptoms include irregular periods, growing facial hair and dficulty getting pregnant. Without hesitation, my mum took me to a salon to have my face waxed. Those appointments continued twice a week for almost four years. I spent so many hours clenching my teeth in pain while the beautician tried to be sympathetic. My mum thought, as did I, that removing the hair was the best thing we could do because it would stop people bullying me. But it didn’t. I remember walking into school after having a wax and one guy making a joke about it looking like someone had taken a razor to my face. I was going through all of this pain – because my skin was so soft and sensitive, particularly at that age – and trying so hard to conform, but all for nothing. The hair was also growing back thicker and darker after every wax. So one day, shortly after my GCSEs, I made a decision. It took a lot of strength but I thought, “I can either keep trying to fit in or I can be me.” Self-harming at school I missed a waxing appointment and when my mum asked me why I simply said, “I think I’m just going to keep it.” She was worried but she knew it was my decision. I spent the whole six-week summer holiday preparing myself and by the time I went back to start sixth form, I had a full beard. But nothing could have prepared me for the hell that awaited me. Things got massively worse and I began to self-harm. A few years ago I met a guy I used to go to school with and he said he remembers seeing marks on my hands. Clearly, no one knew what to say. The teachers occasionally suspended a bully but when they ed they were even worse because I’d got them into trouble, not just with the school but their parents. When I was  I tried to end my le because I felt I couldn’t go on. Because I was going through hell at school, I was really dficult and snappy at home. My attitude used to stink and the hormone imbalance caused by PCOS gave me mad mood swings.  I was taunted continuously and suffered awful dreams about being brutally attacked by my school bullies. When I finally left school, I struggled to find work. I did some agency roles, worked for the postal service and did some nannying but none of it felt right. Then, at , I got engaged. I’d never even met him but someone from the local Sikh temple arranged for me to meet a man in India. Because I really wanted a relationship, and at that time wanted to have children young, I went for it. That might sound mad to some people but in our culture it’s not unusual. The day I met him it was very formal and nine days later we were engaged. He didn’t comment on my facial hair but suddenly there were all these cans and can’ts. I wasn’t allowed to wear make-up or have tattoos and piercings. Then, he told mehe found out I wasn’t a virgin, he would never touch me. I broke up with him two months before we were supposed to get married and I’ve never looked back. Since then, I’ve slowly stepped away from religion and become more spiritual. And as I began to fully accept myself for who I am, I started posting bits and bobs on social media. In , a journalist got in touch with me to do an interview and when it was published, my Instagram blew up. In , I was asked to appear on the catwalk during London Fashion Week for jeweller Marianna Harutunian. Since then, I’ve been in Vogue Japan , Teen Vogue and Cosmo India . I’ve given a TED Talk, I have , Instagram followers and I’ve started my own make-up range.I’m also casually dating. I’m pansexual, which means “hearts not parts” – it doesn’t matter what your sexuality is or what your gender is, I love you for who you are. But I need someone open-minded who wants to stick around and I’m having trouble finding that. I actually had my palm read the other day and the lady told me I’m not going to meet the love of my le in the UK, because a lot of people are still really narrow-minded here. So perhaps they’re abroad! Some people treat me like a fantasy or a fetish, like they want to “try” me. They’ve got kinks that they want to delve into and that’s all I am to them. It can be dficult navigating who’s genuinely interested in me.  I hold my head up high When I think about what it means to be a woman on International Women’s Day, the first word that comes to mind is powerful. Once we understand who we really are and harness that energy, we can literally change the world. But it’s also important to acknowledge that I’m very privileged. I live in the West and even though I’m half-Indian and half-Tanzanian, I still have very fair skin. I think on International Women’s Day we should be thinking about those who aren’t as privileged – who live in countries where they can’t be openly lesbian because they’re at risk of being attacked and sometimes killed, or who are suffering because of female genital mutilation. I think more about them and the dficulties they’re going through. Looking back, despite everything, choosing not to wax my beard is probably one of the greatest decisions I’ve made, because I’m no longer hiding my true self. People still stare at me and make comments –but I hold my head up high. I surround myself with people who are non-judgmental and % on the same wave as me. As hard as the journey has been, I’m grateful.If you are feeling suicidal or affected by issues talked about by Kirk then contact Papyrus, www.papyrus-uk.org or call     or contact Samaritans, www.samaritans.org,  .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON London Fashion WeekEducationPregnancyBullyingBeardsSexualityPeriods\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The business has a . star rating on the site but out of  reviews, more than  were rated as terrible However, there were some aposexcellentapos reviews - with one recent visitor describing it as a splendid hotel.Some reviewers have described it as absolutely disgusting, a vile place and definitely not what you expect for £ a night. In a review as recent as this month, Richard S said: Absolutely disgusting. Not sure whether the staff have fallen out with their cleaning equipmentindeed they have any. Disgusting carpets and had to change rooms because of a large brown wet stain on the duvet cover that had followed through to the mattress cover. Got a new room, went in and there was another two large stains on my bed. He added: Gave up after that and just slept without any bed covers. Donapost think these lot have a care in the world for the hygiene of this crack den, theyaposve probably just given up. Moira H in October said: Arrived at this so called hotel and found pretty much the most dirty, disgusting and in general vile place. The lt doesnapost work, as someone with disability issue this was not good.  The staircase to the room smelt of stale fat and damp. The room was disgusting, one bath towel and one hand towel for two adults! She added: Curtains that we couldnapost close as they were hanging off the rail, a fridge barely balancing on a unit beside the single bed, god forbid you had a child with you as they would have ended up under it, a bathroom window which didnapost close, paint all over the floor of the bathroom. The shower......well..... the trickle was not any use to wash in , to have a cup of tea the kettle had to be plugged in under the desk and left on the floor, pillows were disgusting, didnapost take clothes off to sleep as there was no way I was getting into the bed! Unfortunately, this was a very quickly booked trip, I didnapost have time to look into things the way I normally would, but this so called hotel is the stuff of nightmares.And Courtney M in August said: Absolutely disgusting hotel very nice when walking in but as soon as you go to your room itaposs awful. The drains was blocked and the shower was way to hot or way too cold no in-between, the towels had foundation marks all over. Definitely not what u expect for £ a night for what I paid! The Norfolk Hotel declined to comment when approached about the negative reviews by BirminghamLive.  However, there are many aposexcellentapos and aposvery goodapos reviews for the Norfolk Hotel on Tripadvisor. Neb who posted his review last month, but visited last May, said: Where do I start  The hotel is modern and up to scratch, very polite staff and a very comfortable room! Another positive review said: After reading the reviews Iaposd been tempted to cancel my booking. Iaposm glad I didnapost. I had a lovely clean room, , the most spacious single room Iaposve stayed in. Itaposs warm, comfortable and very quiet. The shower was really hot and the bathroom spotless! The staff were friendly and I would stay here again. Iaposd also be happy to stay here with my daughter.There were a few things that didnapost overly concern me, but may be seen as criticisms by others, breakfast not included, WiFi not included, the Tvaposs aerial is a bit dodgy, and the shower curtain could do with replacing . These aposissues apos didnapost bother me so thataposs the reason Iaposve still given  stars. This hotel, based on this room, does not deserve itaposs terrible status! While another added: We stayed one night whilst watching the cricket. It was £ per person. It was clean, a bit knackered and £ - a bit like a single room in an officer’s mess. Perhaps not the place for a wedding anniversary blow out but perfect for a late night, early start. Our rooms were on the th floor - take an eye mask as the curtains aren’t great. Five stars for value for money. It was £.

However, Ms Phillips, , from Thames Ditton, Surrey, had not booked any undertakers as her -year-old father Brianaposs death was classied as aposunexpectedapos by paramedics. This meant he had to be collected by a dferent funeral director, which was acting on behalf of the coroner. Floyd and Son Funeral Directors, which was contracted by the coroner to transport the body, said the care home should have told Ms Phillips where her dadaposs body was being taken. However, she was forced to track down Brianaposs body alone after Albany Park Nursing Home, in Enfield, London, gave her the name of the undertakers and nothing . Ms Phillips said: “The care home assumed he had been handed to my undertakers. “I said ‘no he hasn’t, my undertaker is not allowed to take him until the coroner has seen the body’. I asked themthey’d handed his body to any old undertaker.Have you had a similar experience  Email webnews@mirror to tell your story “They gave me the name of the funeral directors and I had to look up their number – I remember Googling it.“For three days I was searching for my dad, I was so shocked about what was going on grief didn’t really come into it. “I was thinking ‘where is he ’ My brother joked saying maybe it wasn’t him, maybe he had gone into another room in the care home because he couldn’t get the football on the telly.” The siblings even joked that the wrong body might turn up at the funeral like in the opening scene of the  film Death at a Funeral. Ms Phillips said: “The care home had no idea where he was. I was flabbergasted and angry. The only thing they knew was the name of the undertakers who collected dad. “I would expect a care home to know what mortuary he had been taken to and who the undertakers were. I got the impression they didn’t after they said my undertakers had collected him. “I don’t think they passed over any of my contact details. The coroner said they had no contact details for me.”  After the care home gave her the name of the coroneraposs undertakers, Floyd and Son Funeral Directors, she rang them and found out her dad’s body had been taken to Haringey Mortuary. Her fruit and veg trader father died of suspected Covid on January  last year but it was not until January  that she was able to get through to the mortuary and confirm his body was there. She added: “I had to ring up the mortuary because I needed to know - because of what had gone on before – that he was there. I wanted to make sure, you stop trusting what you hear. “My dad died on the Saturday and I got through to the mortuary on the Monday. “They confirmed they had his body and said I needed to contact the coroner’s office to make an appointment .“I sent them an email and a woman rang me on Tuesday saying she was so glad I contacted her because they had no contact details for me.” Discussing Brianaposs death, Ms Phillips revealed that paramedics attempted to resuscitate him even though he previously had a ‘do not resuscitate’ order in hospital. The order was not transferred to Albany Park when he was discharged from hospital just over two weeks before his death. After the resuscitation efforts failed, the ambulance crew called the police as Brianaposs death was unexpected and therefore needed to be investigated. The police deemed it was not suspicious and rang the coroner service, who in turn organised for Floyd and Son Funeral Directors to collect Brian’s body, Ms Phillips said. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter She is only speaking out now because she does not want another person to go through the same ordeal as her. “Part of me feels guilty about complaining. I know it was a terrible December and January with the second wave, I know how hard everyone was working and how stressed people were,” she said. “ButI don’t say something it’s going to happen again.” Ms Phillips emphasised that she has no issue with Floyd and Son Funeral Directors as they were helpful in her time of need. Dean Floyd, of Floyd and Son Funeral Directors, said: When we arrive at the care home, we introduce ourselves as Floyd and Son, we advise the manager that we are here to collectand they take our details down.We advise them we are taking the deceased to wherever has been requested by the coroner. In this instance Haringey Public Mortuary. The care home should have a duty of care to relay that information to the next of kin. Floyd and Son would not have knowledge of this information. The care home should have given the mortuary number - we never bring a deceased back to Floyd’s. What’s appalling is the number is not manned over the weekend, where our number is, so any of my staff would have been able to advise where Mr Phillips was, but they would not have been able to speak to the Coroner’s office or Mortuary until Monday morning. At the very least the care home should have said Floyd and Son collected the late Brian Phillips, and given them our telephone number and we could have advised the next of kin. Enfield Council launched a safeguarding probe into the case and concluded that in the future the care home should ensure families receive the correct information about undertakers. The council, which does not run the care home, declined to comment when approached by The Mirror. Albany Park Nursing Home was approached for comment.

The little boy she sits and stares at is two-year-old James, who was tragically abducted and ­murdered  years ago by two evil killers, both aged .In an exclusive interview, Denise told the Sunday People how her granddaughter has “helped remind her of the happiness in the world”. She said: “Peyton has been a power of strength for us and helped the light come back into our lives after James. “Her dad Michael looks so much like James and I can see him in Peyton, too. It’s lovely.” Denise will tell Peyton about her uncle James one day but said her granddaughter “is a reminder to try to focus on the happiness in our lives, not the tragedy”. She added: “There is not a day I don’t think of James and now having Peyton in our lives gives me even more strength to fight in his name.” And Denise needed all that strength last month when it was revealed Jon Venables, , one of James’ killers, is bidding for parole. He will appear at a hearing later this year. She said: “I’m living an amazing le and most the time I’m flying with ­happiness but when this comes up it drags me back down again. “It just ­deflates me, it’s just so hard. It’s been never-ending. “But I will fight with everything I possibly can to keep him in prison. It is a le battle. I’ve done it from the ­beginning and I’ll do it until the end.”  Denise, , who has three other sons – Thomas, Leon and Michael – will ­never accept an ­apology from Venables, or speak to him, saying: “I don’t believe he’ll ever be sorry. He should never be allowed back on the streets.” She and husband Stuart are also battling to keep the James Bulger Memorial Trust alive after fundraising was blighted by Covid and they received no Government help. The charity foundation helps young people affected by a crime or bereavement by ­offering them stays at a ­holiday lodge. James’ brutal torture and murder in  at the hands of Venables and Robert Thompson shocked the nation. The twisted pair snatched James from Denise as she was out shopping in Bootle, Merseyside. They were jailed but also given lelong anonymity and new ­identities following their release. Venables was first released in  but then recalled in  and  for possession of child abuse images. Thompson, also , is now free and is living under a new identity. Denise said: “What happened to James is something I think about every day. It has got easier over time but especially when something comes up like it just has, it comes back. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to sht that off. “I’m hoping and praying he doesn’t get ­released because he’s still capable of evil. He’s proven to everyone that he’s still got it and that’s why he’s locked up again.  “I thinkhe comes out he will do something ­because he’s so used to ­being looked after now. He’s a danger to society. I don’t want another family to go through what my family has been through – you’re on a rollercoaster ride from the beginning. He knows where I live, he knows what I look like. I’m not getting told where he lives and I don’t know what he looks like. “Now the lads are older and we’ve got the new baby I’m going to be ­worried. I don’t knowhe’s going to be standing outside my house while we’re all sleeping. “I’m hoping to God he doesn’t find out where Michael lives.” Denise was told by her lawyer that Venables had askedhe could speak to her and say sorry. She said: “I wouldn’t accept his apology. What would he expect me to say. It’s OK  When you murdered my boy in the worst possible way  You can apologise over saying something wrong, but not taking someone’s le.” She also hit out at the criminal justice system, saying: “How much money has he had spent on him  “New identity, new le, protection, yet we live on the edge of our seat. They always look after the one who taken someone’s le and not the victims. It’s wrong on every level, the law should be changed on that.” Denise and Stuart have taken solace in their family. Thomas, Leon and Michael lived at home with her until recently. In November , Michael and partner Leanne had Peyton, Denise’s first grandchild.Denise said: “She’s an absolute doll. She’s such a good baby, she hardly ever cries, she’s walking everywhere, she’s just a joy. She’s at that stage whereyou give her a chocolate bar it doesn’t stay in her hand, it’s all over your furniture.” Leanne thinks Peyton looks a lot like Denise but the new gran said: “We can see Michael more in her. It’s more her eyes than anything. Of course, you have moments when you remember James at that age. “Having our family has helped so much. You could be having a down day but then the front door opens and in they come, that gives you the lt then, it changes your mood and changes the day for you. “It’s just lovely to have them around and we’re always there for them as well. “The years have gone so quick it’s just unbelievable. You see them as babies but now they’re grown men and we’re ­grandparents now.” Last month, the family went to James’ grave, which they call his “resting place”, to mark the th anniversary of his death. But Denise said Peyton’s presence the past two years has altered the ­atmosphere around the date for the family. She said: “She changed the mood on James’ anniversary last year and this. We talk amongst ourselves and we talk about James, but when Peyton came along – it’s still about James – but Peyton takes our attention. Although there’s the grim side, we still give our time to Peyton. She takes me back to when we had James and our lads. We’ve got this new baby in our lives and we absolutely adore and treasure her.”  Michael said: “When it was the anniversary of James in February they came to ours. You could see the smile on the face from Denise having the baby there. It just took her mind off what the day should have been, this little bundle. It was really nice to see.” The family have cleaned the ground at James’ resting place, laid new grass and got a new wrought-iron frame made. Denise said: “Michael brings Peyton to James’ resting place and it’s nice he makes her a part of it. At Christmas Eve we go and put up a Christmas tree for James. We always have a star that goes on top of the tree at Christmas Eve and that’s always been Michael’s job. Maybe it’s something he and Peyton can do ­together this year.” They also have a quiet place in honour of James behind their home in Merseyside – James’ Garden. Denise said: “Because James isn’t here to spend the money on, we put the money into our own ­private little garden. “We’ve got a fish pond out there we’ve got a ­waterfall fountain thing with Christmas lights. “It’s a constant reminder of him for us.” Later this month, Denise and Stuart are hosting the Black Tie and Tiara Ball for the James Bulger Memorial Trust. Denise said: “It’s so good to be fundraising again in James’ name and for his trust. Lockdown made it really dficult and we seriously had to consider whether to close the trust, such was the upkeep of the lodge and other things. “We also had to cancel on the eve of a big charity ball which would’ve marked James’ th birthday because of Covid. “Since then we’ve struggled – we’re not the only ones. But now we’re back. We have got a good line-up – Claire Sweeney and a Jersey Boys tribute act. It will be a great night.” Denise added: “Sometimes I feel like throwing my cards down and saying I’ve had enough. But then I speak to Stuart and the lads, and look at Peyton. “And I did make that promise to James and I will stand by it. I’ll always keep ­going for him.”The Black Tie and Tiara Ball in aid of the James Bulger Memorial Trust is on Saturday, March , at the Crowne Plaza, Liverpool.

The fact The Queen appointed Harry as her Commonwealth Youth ambassador and that bride-to-be Meghan accompanied him to the  Commonwealth Youth Summit was proof of the confidence which she had in them both. A month later, as Meghan walked down the aisle her ft veil included hand-stitched detail depicting the flowers of every Commonwealth nation in homage to The Queenaposs Coronation gown.  Meghanaposs mother, Doria Ragland, had flown from Calornia and was the only member of her family present. Thomas did not attend saying he wanted to spare the couple any embarrassment after an incident which saw him pose for paparazzi pictures as he prepared for the big day. It was unclear why Michael, a US air force veteran and diplomat who had once secured her an internship at the US embassy in Argentina, was not invited.  But, Mr Hardman adds, the dynamics of her family certainly eclipsed the usual criticisms about the Royal Family being dysal.The book also reveals The Queen knew the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would notto royal le as soon as she learned they had left with their dogs in tow. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stunned the world when they quit their royal duties in , revealing they were starting a new le overseas.Some around the corridors of Buckingham Palace expected them to one dayto the fold, but the -year-old monarch knew dferently. She told a visitor she did not expect them to resume royal le. When asked about a futurefor the couple, she replied: “Of course not. They took the dogs.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CommonwealthBuckingham PalacePrince HarryThe QueenMeghan MarklePrince Charles, Prince of WalesMarriageRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They took the dogs.”  Meghan loves animals and was heartbroken when she had to leave her Labrador-Shepherd mix dog Bogart behind when she moved to the UK, because of his age.Sources suggested Bogart did not join them in their new Los Angeles home as he “ did not get on with Harry ”.The Sussexes currently have two dogs- a beagle named Guy and a black Labrador called Pula - who Meghan used to dress in Union Flag colours. Pula is the currency of Botswana, the African country which became a “refuge” for the prince following the death of Princess Diana.  Botswana is also where the couple spent five nights camping together when they were first dating. Meghan, a promoter of adopting rescue dogs, chose animal welfare charity Mayhew as one of her first patronages. She has previously said the pair of rescue dogs mean the absolute world to her and has referred to them as my loves and my boys. Chat show host Ellen DeGeneres first convinced Meghan to adopt Bogart when she bumped into her in a shelter. Prince Harry’s love of dogs runs in the family, with his grandmother best known for her love of corgis.  Harry revealed in  the corgis took to his then new partner “straight away”. He said: “Iaposve spent the last  years being barked at this one walks in, absolutely nothing.” The Queen has owned more than  corgis, many of them direct descendants of her first one, Susan - given to her as an th birthday present by her parents in . Susan was so loved that she accompanied the then Princess Elizabeth on her honeymoon.

She tells her daughter she doesnapost have a secret and that itaposs all down to good genetics.  But, she confesses her long-le must be due in part to her lestyle, because her mum died aged .

She had collapsed while she was with her daughter after she went outsideJenner Dorian Image: Jenner DorianByDanny RiggGraeme Murray:,  Mar A brain tumour caused a mum to collapse in the street while carrying her two-year-old son. Jenner Dorian, , later developed dyslexia and epilepsy after the traumatic incident, which happened outside a high street sports chain. The mum, who did a postgraduate diploma in English teaching, was forced to come to terms with feeling useless, and now has dyslexia and struggles to read and process information She woke-up confused in an ambulance after leaving Sports Direct in Southport, Merseyside, for some fresh air.Jenner told the Liverpool Echo : I wasnapost even sure what was going on and what had happened to me. I think I passed out again in the ambulance, and then woke up in hospital. There was this pattern of me waking up in hospital every couple of days when I was having these seizures. It was one of the scariest things Iaposve ever been through, to be honest. I had no idea what was going on with me and I just wanted answers.Jenner started getting really bad headaches once every couple of months when she was , but they later became more frequent until it was almost constant.They were debilitating at times, leaving Jenner bedbound and also suffering depression, anxiety and nightmares while her mental health took a hit. Collapsing in public finally forced Jenner to seek some answers. She kept having seizures almost every day during the week she spent in hospital undergoing CT and MRI scans until doctors, suspecting she had a brain tumour, referred her to a specialist neurology hospital.  She felt kind of relieved when she got a definitive diagnosis of a brain tumour. Jenner said: I know it sounds really weird, but I just wanted answers for so long as to what was going on, so when they said that, I was like, aposOkay, Iaposm not going crazy, thereaposs actually something thereapos. Obviously, I was scared at moments, but it was more a worry as I didnapost know what was going to happen with it. I didnapost knowit was going to spread, orit was going to get worse. Doctors worried it was spreading and could cause blindness when they noticed she lost a big chunk of her peripheral vision, leading to surgery in November . For a few months, that was it, until Jenner started having seizures again in March , resulting in an official epilepsy diagnosis. Jenner said:I remember really panicking that this was going to ruin my le, and I guess it did, to some extent, because I lost my job because I couldnapost work anymore in retail with epilepsy, because it was too big a risk. Then I ended up losing my home because I didnapost have the finance to fund it anymore. I was very lucky that my partner said that weaposd go and live together and heaposd help me through everything, because without that, I donapost know what would have happened.  Her story didnapost end there, or with her later dyslexia diagnosis when she went back to university for a psychology MA, motivated by her experience with a brain tumour. The seizures continue, albeit shorter and less frequent, and her one-year scan in November  revealed something on her brain, making her really, really nervous. She said: Iaposm kind of in limbo. Is this another tumour  Or is it just scar tissue  Or is it some kind of cyst on my brain thataposs formed at the surgery site  I actually got to see the scan this time, and you could just see the big hole in my brain where the previous tumour had been taken out, and then this little, white fleck in the middle of all that mass is something new thataposs growing there. Hopefully itaposs not growing at all and itaposs not going to be dangerous, but itaposs hard to say at the moment. Itaposs such a big thing to undergo, and I feel like I just got myself into a good place mentally and physically, and then itaposs like being thrown back in at the deep end all over again.Dr David Jenkinson, chief scientic officer at The Brain Tumour Charity, said: This Brain Tumour Awareness Month is a really important opportunity to highlight the need for progress on brain tumours and that we all stand united in defeating the devastation they cause.Having seizures and being diagnosed with epilepsy on top of the diagnosis of a brain tumour can be overwhelming and can cause frustration or feelings of isolation or worry, and itaposs vital that people are supported to deal with these impacts. Weaposd encourage anyone in need of more support in dealing with these impacts to talk to their doctor or specialist nurse, and you can also contact our Support and Information Line too on   . Weaposre here for you. Around , people in the UK are diagnosed with a brain tumour each year and while we have seen some encouraging steps forward in both research and care in recent years, we know progress isnapost happening fast enough and we need to act now. We need to see greater investment in world-class research now, to help diagnose the disease earlier, to better understand the causes and find new treatments, in order to give those affected hope of more time to live and a better quality of le. A cure canapost wait. As a charity, we are determined to invest another £m in forward-thinking research over the next five years to help double survival and halve the harm the disease causes.

The new rules and regulations being brought in at the beginning of April cover areas such as orce proceedings, paying taxes and receiving money from the Government. Some of them only businesses but several could affect ordinary people, too. WalesOnline reports on some of the key measures which people may not be aware of.VED rates are going up meaning a rise in car tax from April  From April , Vehicle Excise Dutywill rise in line with the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation from April . But how much the cost will rise by will depend upon your vehicles emissions. For instance,your car emits no CO, your car tax will remain at . If your caraposs CO emissions are between  and g per km, your standard rate of car tax will increase from £ to £, but your first year rate will still be £.  The amount you pay also depends on how often you want to make a payment. There’s a five per cent surchargeyou pay monthly or every six months. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agencyruns computer tests every month to check whether the owners of cars registered in the UK have paid tax. If the system flags up an untaxed vehicle that is not declared SORN , the DVLA will send a fine of £ to the owner. If this is paid within  days, a  per cent discount should be applied. New orce laws will come into force from  April  On  April this year changes to the legislation on orce will come into force. The changes are part of the Divorce, Dissolution and Separation Act , which aims to reduce the potential for conflict amongst orcing couples by:removing the ability to make allegations about the conduct of a spouse allowing couples to end their marriage jointlyThe act also introduces a minimum period of  weeks between the start of proceedings and application for conditional order.  This provides couples with a meaningful period of reflection and the chance to reconsider. Where orce is inevitable, it enables couples to cooperate and plan for the future. It will also no longer be possible to contest a orce, except on limited grounds including jurisdiction.It is worth noting that, as the new changes are brought in, the current online service will be unavailable from  March . You can find out more about this on the governmentaposs website.HMRC will stop making payments to Post Office card accounts after  April  About , customers still need to switch so they don’t miss out on vital payments as HMRC will stop making payments to Post Office card accounts after  April . This means customers must noty HMRC of their new account details. Customers can choose to receive their benefit payments to a bank, building society or credit union account. If they already have an alternative account, they can contact HMRC now to update their details.If a customer misses the  April deadline, their payments will be paused until the customer noties HMRC of their new account details.Customers can also use The Money Helper website, which offers information and advice about how to choose the right current account and how to open an account.Employers will have to increase wages paid to some workers Changes in the minimum wage are in the pipeline. The Low Pay Commission made recommendations to the UK Government on what the minimum wage and living wage should be for . The UK Government accepted those recommendations and from April , , it will be law for employers to pay their staff no less than the new rates. New living wage and minimum wage rates from April  can be found on gov.uk. New tax for plastic packaging A new plastic packaging tax is coming into force in April  that will apply to all plastic packaging manufactured in the UK, or imported into the UK, that does not contain at least % recycled plastic. The government has defined plastic packaging as “packaging that is predominantly plastic by weight” and the new tax will not apply to any plastic packaging which containing at least  per cent recycled plastic or any packaging.  Imported plastic packaging will be liable to the tax whether the packaging is unfilled or filled. The Government says the new tax aims to “provide a clear economic incentive for businesses to use recycled plastic in the manufacture of plastic packaging” and should lead to increased levels of recycling and collection of plastic waste, saving much of it from going to landfill. The new law will take effect from April . Accountancy firm Harold Duckworth reports the rate of tax will be £ per metric tonne of plastic packaging. Changes in corporation tax Companies and unincorporated associations that pay corporation tax will be affected by changes which come into effect on April , . HM Revenue and Customs has set the “main rate” for corporation tax for all non-ring-fenced profits to  per cent for the financial year that begins on April , , increasing to  per cent of profits over £, from April , . A small profits ratewill also be introduced at this time for companies with profits of £, or less so that they will continue to pay corporation tax at  per cent. Households urged to get ready for £ council tax rebateHouseholds across England are being urged to set up direct debits with their local council to receive a council tax rebate that will help millions of families manage costs of living.People who pay council tax by direct debit will see the cash go directly into their bank accounts from April. Those who do not pay by direct debit will be contacted by their council and invited to make a claim. Around  million households in council tax bands A to D - including  per cent of rented properties - are set to benefit from the £ billion council tax rebate, which does not have to be repaid.  It is part of a package of government measures to help families with rising energy costs. An extra £ million will also be given to councils to provide discretionary support to vulnerable households who may not qualy for the £ council tax rebate. This includes people on low incomes in council tax bands E to H.According to the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Rt Hon Michael Gove : As we emerge from the pandemic, we understand the pressures facing many families as global inflation levels increase.The support we have introduced will help millions of people, particularly those on the lowest incomes and the most vulnerable. We continue to stand behind the British people and I urge everyone who is eligible to claim this rebate to do so. Changes to fuel Red diesel and rebated biofuels will become illegal from April , which will mainly affect users of off-road vehicles such as bulldozers and cranes. The change is being made to help the UK meet its  climate commitments.

Her Majesty, who usually resides in London, has been working from home at Windsor Castle for the last two years since the pandemic began.And now with more health concerns having recently caught Covid- and suffering from more mobility issues, the -year-old is said to have decided to make Windsor her official residence.Buckingham Palace, which has been the official royal residence since , is currently undergoing a £million refurbishment which is due to be completed in .  When the renovations began, it was planned that the Queen would only moved out of her private apartments temporarily. But since then, it has been decided that she will vacate the Palace for good to minimise her travel, with it also no longer deemed suitable for a long-term home, The Times reports. Itaposs understood the Queen will also permanently work from home at Windsor Castle. The record-breaking monarch will celebrate her th birthday this year, and was reported to have said that she “couldn’t move” as she leaned on her walking stick at a meeting at the Castle last month. Last October, the Queen was advised to rest for several weeks on doctor’s orders, after going for tests at hospital for an unspecied illness. She also tested positive for Covid- last month, experiencing “light symptoms” while she continued to carry out “light duties”. The Queen spent much of lockdown at Windsor with Prince Philip until his death in April last year. It is expected that Her Majesty willand “be visible” at Buckingham Palace for festivities such as the Platinum Jubilee celebrations this year.For her birthday on June , she will still appear in the balcony of the central London residence. And the Union Jack, which flies to signy the monarch is not at the Palace, will now remain permanently, disappointing any tourists hoping to catch a glimpse of her while visiting London. During the pandemic, the Queen did not switch her residence seasonally as normal, where she typically ummer with family at Balmoral in Aberdeenshire and takes up residence at her Norfolk estate, Sandringham, from December until mid-February. Her next event outside Windsor Castle is the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on, this month on March .

Georgette Winslow, four months, was born with a full head of hair that has continued growing vertically.Her mum, Jenni Winslow, , debunked the old wives tale that heartburn in pregnancies means hairy babies, as she never suffered a thing.Jenni, a personal trainer, says everyone immediately falls in love with with Georgetteaposs hair. She said: It wasnapost a surprise when she was born with hair. Because she has downs syndrome, we were going in for regular scans, and the technician would always say aposoh my god she has loads of hair!aposIt was hard to see how much hair she had when was born, but once sheaposd had a little wash you could tell there was loads. We were in the NICU for a while when she was born, and all the nurses would come in and say everyone had told them to come and see her hair. Jenni, from South Dakota, US, says the comparison to the cartoon character originated from her mum, but friends soon agreed.  She said: I was just talking to my mum one day and she said her hair reminded her of a cartoon character. It was until later I found a picture of Jimmy Neutron, and I could totally see what she meant.I posted a photo of them side-by-side, and all my friends said they had thought the exact same thing.Jenni has attempted to style her hair, but without much success.She said: After her bath I just let it dry naturally, and it always sticks up like that because itaposs so fluffy.I have been tempted to put it in a pony tail, but I only did that once.I was scared about pulling her skin too much so we only left it up for a minute before I let it loose again. Jenniaposs other children, Viola, six, and Sullivan, three, were also born with hair, as was husband Barrett, .  She said: Sullivan was born with old man hair, he had a bald patch at the top of his head. Violaaposs hair was similar to Georgetteaposs, but it wasnapost as thick or as long as hers. Now, Georgetteaposs has just kept growing. Jenni started an instagram page to document Georgetteaposs journey and raise awareness about downs syndrome.She said: A lot of time people have found the account because of her hair, and only see she has downs syndrome because of the hashtags. I like to think it challenges people on their misconceptions, and helps them see the inidual before the diagnosis.You can follow Georgetteaposs journey @georgette-gazette on Instagram.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BabiesDowns syndrome\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He said you need to pick the right eggs, use certain types of pans, and Jordanaposs also added a few other little-known hacks to help get them just right. What do you think of Jordanaposs tips  Let us know in the comments...Jordan said: To avoid the egg-white spreading through the water, always opt for the freshest eggs possible. As eggs get older, the whites get more liquid, meaning you run the risk of the whites spreading around your pan. If you do have older eggs spare don’t let them go to waste, they are perfect for making soft boiled and hard-boiled eggs. A drop of vinegar or lemon juice in your water can really help the whites to set up and envelop the yolk fully. The acid reacts with the egg-white, allowing it to firm up more quickly, rather than spreading through the water. Don’t use too much though. A teaspoonful is a perfect amount to avoid leaving an acidic taste on your poached eggs. Jordan also said you have to be careful to get the water to the right temperature, asit boils too vigorously it will rip the egg apart. He continued: Vigorously boiling water can cause the egg to tear and break. Instead, look for small bubbles at the bottom of the pan so you know you’ve got the right temperature. To achieve the perfect poaching temperature bring the water to the boil and then reduce to simmer. Not only do the small bubbles mean you’ve got the heat right, they can also stop your egg from hitting the bottom of the pan and sticking. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. Use a really deep pan for that classic tear-drop shape. To help you get perfect poached eggs, use a really deep stockpot, full to the brim with simmering water. Forget the whirlpool and vinegar technique this time, and simply drop your eggs into the water. “As the depth of the pan is so great, the egg white will wrap around the yolk before it hits the bottom, leaving you with a gorgeous shape, perfect for eggs benedict or topping avocado on toast. Poaching an egg in shallow water will create a flat-shaped egg.” The chef advised: “Doing this will help the eggs form a more spherical shape. The eggs transferring from a cold to hot temperature will increase the chances of a runny yolk yet keeping the firm consistency of the whites, as it slows the cooking time of the yolk, whilst letting the whites cook completely.” Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON StepsFood\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Serve the food you really want to eat by signing up for our tips and recipes and never be bored by your cooking againSign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As first reported by North Wales Live, the group entered the tunnel through a heavy steel lidded manhole and climbed down steel steps. Then they tried to cross to the other side of the bridge.The space was described as claustrophobic and the distance from one end of the tunnel to the other was surprisingly long. At the halfway point, the explorers say they were able to look down through narrow gaps onto the motorway below which helped keep them calm, in a strange way. However, that feeling was about to change dramatically.Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.The group recalled seeing objects in the distance at the far end of the tunnel, so they carried on further. They explained: We reached the end, and let me tell you, We have never felt the same sense of dread before or since. In front of us was a single fold-away chair positioned facing a wall.  On the wall was a partially torn page from a newspaper, or a magazine, showing a fully naked lady in an erotic position. I canapost put my finger on it but it seemed more sinister than sexythat makes any sense. The scene that lay before us had rendered us completely speechless, and an overpowering sense of panic could be felt collectively. They went on to say that the whole thing made them want to leave as fast as humanly possible. Needless to say we got out of tunnel, as fast as humanly possible, smashing our knees and shins against the sharp cement edges, that lined the path to the ladder by which we had entered, they added. Of course, we were all praying to God that the man-hole hadnapost been re-sealed, as it was impossible to tell until you reached the ladder itself. Thankfully the exit route was clear, and we promptly dashed as far away as our legs could carry us.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The footage shows Meg wandering around the large property - which she says was once a hoarderaposs house - observing the many personal items left behind.Meg was only able to piece together some semblance of who the previous occupants were after coming across their old driversapos licenses, degree certicates and business cards. Old fashioned ornaments can be seen cluttering up one shelf, while childhood photographs were found nestled among the personal effects. A floral clock still hangs on the wall above a fireplace, while bottles of liquor gather dust in the dingy corners. Meg says she could have spent hours just looking at the book collection, which included a number of books from iconic horror writer Anne Rice. The urban explorer added: Iaposm not sure why everything was left behind but they had quite a aposcollectionapos, later remarking in the comments section that there was so much treasure. They definitely liked to collect antiques. Despite the decay, the loveliness of the house still lingers, and many of Megaposs followers have been left besotted with it, expressing great sadness at its sorry state of disrepair.

For the latest updates follow our dedicated Russia-Ukraine war liveblogCivilians cheered as the jet – one of which is thought to have been a Sukhoi Su- fighter-bomber used in Syria – was downed. Ukrainians claim to have killed more than , of Putinaposs troops – many of whom are teenage conscripts sent to their deaths by the despot. Russian airstrikes have killed hundredsnot thousands of civilians across Ukraine, while more than . million have fled the country.Video of captured airmen in the back of a truck, shared on social media, shows captors saying: You are killing our people, you b*****d. One pilot says he was on a rescue mission and pleads he was just ordered to fly. Despite having the second largest air force after America, with more than , planes, Russiaaposs advance into Ukraine has been slow. Brutal attacks have been punctuated by embarrassing logistical failures stemming from poor maintenance of vehicles and apparent bad planning.  There have been reports of Russian troops surrendering and even puncturing their vehicleaposs fuel tanks in a bid to avoid conflict. Videos have shown Ukrainian farmers towing away expensive Russian tanks, missile launchers and troop carriers. A -mile long aposConvoy of Deathapos which was ominously advancing on Kyiv with fears of a forthcoming siege, appears to have ground to a halt, among rumours of supply issues and break downs.  Experts suggested pictures showing vehicleaposs shredded tyres pointed to a lack of regular maintenance. In less than two weeks, Ukraine claims to have downed  planes and  helicopters, blown up  tanks,  armoured cars and  fuel tankers. Yesterday, a Russian aposHindapos helicopter was hit with a stinger missile in the skies above Kozarovychi,  miles from the capital.  It is thought to have been a Soviet-era Mil Mi- Hind gunship, dubbed the flying tank, while where two MI- and two MI- helicopters and warplanes including two Su-s, two Su-s and one Su-SM are believed to have been blasted out of the sky.This morning, the Ministry of Defence said the Ukrainian resistance was appearing to fight back with surprising ferosity.But itaposs feared Putinaposs actions will escalate as Moscow becomes increasingly desperate.  Russian forces have seized the strategically important Black Sea ports of Berdiansk and Kherson but the end goal is Kyiv and a peace agreement is widely considered to be the only likely end to the conflict. Putin has dubbed Western sanctions as like a declaration of war. Heaposs said anyone enforcing a controversial no-fly zone over Ukraine will be judged to have entered the war and has told the west he wonapost forget its response.  A ceasefire was agreed to allow for the evacuation of blockaded port city Mariupol in the southeast and the bombed-out eastern town of Volnovakha, but it was reportedly breached by Russian troops. This morning, it was again said to be in place but there was no clear indication of how long it will last.It comes as Boris Johnson drew up a six-point plan to put to world leaders about how to deal with Putin. Meanwhile the US special forces and SAS commandoes are said to be preparing for a high-risk rescue of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.The leader is said to have survived three assassination attempts in a week after double agents blew the plots apart but Russian Spetsnaz special forces are said to now be targeting him.

As the conflict rages, footage has emerged from across the ravaged country showing how unarmed civilians have climbed on top of armoured vehicles and barricaded routes into their towns and cities to halt the advance of Russian convoys. Others have hurled Molotov cocktails at vehicles as they resist occupation – while some bravely confront Kremlin troops unarmed.Here, we give the stories behind some of the astonishing images of the everyday men and women battling Vladimir Putin ’s forces. Bila Tserkva, near KyivJust  miles from Kyiv, Ukrainians from all walks of le have been keeping their spirits up by making Molotov cocktails. They began after officials issued advice to civilians on how to launch the petrol bombs at enemy tanks to help repel their advance. And across the nation, people are now flocking to help manufacture them en masse. Follow all of of todayaposs news on the war in Ukraine as it unfolds with our live blogOne video shows Bila Tserkva locals laughing as they go about their work in woodland. An elderly woman grins at the camera while the man filming her says: “Look at this ‘smoothie’.”He then adds defiantly: “You will burn, occupants, andnot we will help you for sure with that. Glory to Ukraine!” Bucha, near KyivThe city of Bucha, also in the wider Kyiv region, has suffered a relentless onslaught over the past week. One video shows roads strewn with rubble after fighting intensied, bringing the town to the brink of destruction. Smoke billows through the streets as one man surveys the wreckage and he tells the Russian forces: “Guys, that is what is left near my house. I will find a way to repay you.”  On Thursday, Ukrainian forces claimed to have liberated Bucha, raising the country’s flag above its town hall and saying: “Glory to Ukraine and its soldiers.” But locals have been playing their part too. Footage from last week shows Russian heavy military equipment engulfed in flames after a resident reportedly launched a Molotov cocktail at it.Kupiansk, KharkivKupiasnk, near Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv, is no stranger to the brutality of occupation. During the Second World War, German forces arrived in July  and stayed until the Soviet army liberated the population seven months later. But on February , it was Russian forces that took over as part of Putin’s bloody invasion. The town’s mayor, Hennadiy Matsehora, surrendered in exchange for peace. Ukraine has now indicted him for treason. Yet fearless locals refuse to submit to Kremlin aggression.  Footage shows unarmed students waving Ukraine’s flag in a square. And when an armoured car approaches, they crowd around it, forcing it to slow down. One young man climbs on top and tries to break the windscreen with his foot. The car speeds up and he is thrown from the roof – but as it rolls out of sight, another man launches a stick at it.Enerhodar, ZaporizhzhiaEnerhodar became a flashpoint this week when Russian forces attacked its nuclear power plant – Europe’s largest.They seized control by shelling it but thankfully a disaster which would have dwarfed Chernobyl was averted as no radioactive material was released.Ukraine remains in control of operations but fears of a disaster remain.  Yet residents are doing everything they can to stop Russian forces advancing. Barricades made of tyres, planks of wood and metal spikes have sprung up. In some cases, their efforts have worked as footage shows a military column having to reverse.Melitopol, ZaporizhzhyaRussian forces arrived in Melitopol on February  – a day after the invasion began. Days of fighting ensued, with reports an emergency rescue unit was shelled. On March , mayor Ivan Fedorov said the city was occupied. But furious residents took to the streets to halt the Russian advance. A video shows a soldier pointing his gun at them as they chant: “Occupants!” Seconds later, he fires a warning shot and a man yells: “You’re fascists! Would you shoot civilians ”When the Russian column tries to advance, people throw themselves in front of it. And as it finally breaks through the crowd, the locals cry: “Murderers! Murderers!”Nedryhailiv, SumyIn the town of Nedryhailiv – home to , – a resident was filmed lobbing a Molotov at a Russian armoured vehicle as an onlooker shouts: “Good job!” And an unarmed man tells Russian troops: “Glory to Ukraine.” When told to stop shooting his video, he says: “Why  The Ukrainian constitution allows for filming.”OdesaPutin is desperate to seize the port city of Odesa, as it could open up a corridor to Kyiv from the south. Its strategic location on the Black Sea coast means it plays a vital role in the Ukrainian economy – so losing it would be a hammer blow. Naval and ground forces are said to be en route and last week, locals were preparing to greet them with Molotovs and makesht weapons.Koriukivka, ChernihivIn March , , of Koriukivka’s residents were massacred by Nazi soldiers in just two days. A week later, some elderly residents ed, thinking the SS troops had gone. But the troops came back and burned them alive. Now, its people face a dferent aggressor – yet they refuse to yield to the Russian forces.  Footage from last week shows a brave woman marching up to a convoy of enemy tanks and confronting the soldiers, despite being completely unarmed. Trying to reason with them and appeal to their consciences, she tells them: “I understand, you are soldiers. You cannot just give up. But you can say, ‘Our heavy equipment has broken down.’ You don’t want to discuss anything with us, even though we ask you.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Black SeaVladimir PutinSoldiersRussia Ukraine warUkraineSunday Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He flew into Krakow, Poland, on Saturday and then took a train to Przemysl, before boarding another train to the Ukrainian city of Lviv.Standing outside Przemysl train station, six miles from the border, he told me: I havenapost told my mum where I am yet. Iaposm just about to. I think she might freak out. I thought about telling her that Iaposm just driving refugees here, but I might as well tell her the truth now Iaposm going to be in the paper.I told my dadaposs girlfriend over the phone. She said aposwell doneapos, although I didnapost tell her Iaposm going into Ukraine. She thinks Iaposm just mopping tables in Poland. Iaposve told all my mates the truth. They think Iaposm mad. Some were a bit upset. They didnapost want me to go. They said aposdonapost goapos to be honest. Theyaposre not playing the Russians are they, so theyaposre a bit worried. Stephen added: When it all kicked off I thought aposIaposm going inapos. I want to help end the war and do my little bit. I went off and bought my plane ticket and then locked my house up on Friday and asked my mate to look after my dog Floyd. Heaposs a pitbull rottweiler. Iaposve left the keys with my mate and told him he can have it allI donapost make it back. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putinaposs troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nationaposs army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous.On Sunday, February , Ukraineaposs health minister reported that at least  Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than , wounded. On March , Ukraine claimed to have killed , Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently veried but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than  civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least  people have been killed, including  children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher. It comes as Ukraineaposs President accused Russia of aposstate terrorismapos on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv.  Stephen, who is ft in, told me he served six years in the army in Germany with the Royal Signals from . He now owns his own olive oil business in Catalonia, Spain, where he has lived a peaceful existence for the past  years. But he dismissed my suggestion he was travelling to Ukraine for an adventure. And he dismissed my suggestion he is looking for adventure. He said: No, itaposs definitely not an adventure. If I wanted an adventure Iaposd go to Alton Towers or something. Donapost get me wrong, Iaposm worried. I am a bit afraid. Iaposm not super confident... I donapost think its sunk in yet what Iaposm doing.  Iaposve never been to Ukraine before and Iaposve always wanted to go, although not in these circumstances. When I get to Ukraine and start hearing little noises and bangs and people filling up Molotovs and walking round with rles and helmets and body armour, then it might start sinking in. It feels quite strange to be going there, but Iaposm ready to do anything. He added: Some people have said to me aposyouaposre British, itaposs not your problem to do something thisapos, but it is. Putin has been brutal in the way he has obliterated Ukrainian cities. He has known about the possibility of sanctions for years, so I think the British government needs to do more than what itaposs doing. Sanctions hurt the Russian public more than Putin. I think our government are scared of Putin and they need to be tougher on him, but I donapost want to see us or NATO send troops in because it would be World War Three then.  Stephen spoke to me while carrying his clothes and vital supplies - including Tampax to stuff his woundshe gets shot - in a Royal Mail postbag slung over his shoulder. It was clear he was trying to play down the reality of what he may face, but also that he was fully aware he could face death. When I asked himheaposs afraid of dying, Stephen, whose dad Colin served in northern Ireland, said: If youaposre gonna die, youaposre gonna die anyway arenapost you, thereaposs no point worrying. I know I could die, but Iaposve tried not to think about it.At the moment my biggest worry is finding somewhere to watch Forest Huddersfield in the FA Cup on Monday night.Hopefully I can get a decent bar to watch it in and forget about the war for a couple of hours. Anything , Iaposll worry about on Tuesday. Stephen added: Iaposm not sure how long Iaposll stay out there. Iaposve got a few hundred Euros in my pocket. Iaposve packed three or four pairs of socks and woolly things, long johns and plenty of warm clothes and Tampax and gaffer tape in case I get shot, thataposs about it really. If anything does happen I can semi look after myself until help turns up.  Stephen, who said he speaks French, Spanish, and a little bit of Polish, will initially base himself in Lviv, western Ukraine, but is happy to travel to Kyiv to fight or anywhere  in the country, which is now under siege by Russian troops. But despite his seemingly easygoing nature, he made it clear he does not advise everyone to follow in his footsteps. He said: I thinkyouaposve not had any military training you could get in the way a bit. I donapost what Iaposm going to be like when bullets start flying, but I think I can get my head round it and see what happens. Iaposll go to Kyivthey want to send me there. Iaposm ready to do anything. They can give me a rle or ask me to do humanitarian work. Iaposll do it. I donapost mind either. Iaposve fired all sorts of guns, including rocket launchers, and I can drive a tank. I can do quite a few things, as long as I can remember! I used to do morse code, but even though Iaposve forgotten a lot of it, I can still write down the letters. Iaposm sure itaposll all come back to me, like riding a bike. Before saying goodbye Stephen stepped onto the stationaposs  five and defiantly clenched his fists before boarding the .pm Lviv-bound train emblazoned with the slogan aposGlory to Ukraineapos. He said: Iaposm keen to get there now. Iaposm sure Iaposll be alright. Keep in touch!.

What can we do, in the face of the suffering of young and old, and the frightening prospect of a wider European war  Respect, then, to the Merseyside dockers who refused to unload Russian oil bound for Stanlow Oil Refinery, Cheshire, in solidarity with the Ukrainians. The Government has already banned vessels owned, operated or chartered by Russia from our ports but those registered with other countries can still transport Russian products to Britain. In highlighting what trade unions say is a loophole in UK sanctions, the dockers have shown that iniduals can make a dference.They should be praised for standing by Ukraine. We echo their call for the Government to change the rule that would have allowed a German vessel to unload its Russian cargo on our shores. Companies have been trying to do their bit as well by depriving Russian consumers of their goods or closing their Russian stores, to heap pressure on Putin’s regime. They, too, deserve praise. But some big names – among them McDonald’s – have failed to pull the plug. It’s time for them to act and to put principles before profit. Still walking in fear The women and men who joined vigils after the death of Sarah Everard a year ago hoped they could make a dference. They believed her rape and murder might be a turning point, sparking action to make the streets safer. So it’s heartbreaking to learn that since Sarah’s killing by a serving police officer, there have been almost , attacks on the streets of England and Wales. The chilling statistics, from app WalkSafe, also highlight where most attacks take place. Car parks are worst, followed by areas near sports and recreation facilities, and supermarkets. As WalkSafe co-founder Emma Kay says, it’s awful to think these attacks are happening as women are doing everyday things. While the horrors of war rightly dominate the headlines, we must not forget the issue of violence against women, to ensure Sarah has a lasting legacy.

First deputy minister of foreign affairs Emine Dzhaparova said: “Russian armed forces keep attacking maternity wards, kindergartens, orphanages, hospitals. One hospital has set up a neonatal intensive care unit in a basement. Doctors have warned a lack of specialist drugs and medical equipment mean some tots born in dangerous conditions will not live.  Heartbreaking scenes of tiny tots being cared for in makesht shelters have been shared by medics throughout the invasion of Ukraine. On the second day of the assault, staff from Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Children’s Hospital moved twelve newborn babies to safety downstairs to avoid Putin’s missiles. Dr Denis Surkov, , chief of the neonatal unit at Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Children’s Hospital said of the bunker: “This is the neonatal intensive care unit.

There,  or so kids are trapped by their own bodies.Without the dialysis machines they may die. If they stay in war-torn Kyiv, they may die. Friday’s news of Russia ’s capture of Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant and gains in the south was bleak. So a young woman becoming red-nosed clown Chou-Chou – “Crazy-Crazy” – and getting sick kids to laugh out loud showed how the ordinary, ­extraordinary people of Ukraine can turn terror into sheer, bloody brilliant joy. It stabbed me in the heart.As the desperately poorly kids giggled, cracked jokes and gave me the thumbs up, I was in tears behind my mask. Grief is common in Kyiv but so is ­anger. The Kremlin hates free speech, reporters, democratic argument, MPs mouthing off or comics poking fun – all of which you can see on Ukrainian TV. Follow all of of todayaposs news on the war in Ukraine as it unfolds with our live blog  Vladimir Putin ’s solution  Fire ­missiles at Kyiv’s TV tower. I hitchhiked to the tower to inspect the damage, where I was challenged by Rost, a Ukrainian in a dark hoodie armed to the teeth.Everywhere you go you get challenged by men with guns. A Russian missile had punched a hole the size of beach hut in the TV control building. There was a bright patch of red against the rubble and snow. The worker’s body had been removed but his blood had not been washed away. I asked Rost what he did before the war. “I used to be a hot air balloon pilot,” he replied. In Ukraine, the surreal comes as standard. Across a road two more Russian missiles had overshot their target and hit a row of shops, some of which were still smoking.  In front of us were the bodies of an old man, a mother and her child. Men from the ­mortuary came out and placed blankets over the dead. Yet the Kremlin insists it is not targeting civilians in Ukraine. That is a lie. This is not Russia’s war. Its soldiers don’t want to kill their Ukrainian ­grannies in Kyiv and are abandoning their heavy machinery. On social media you can see Ukrainian tractor boys towing a million tank and three lads on a side-car stealing a Russian gun, and laughing their heads off. The Ukrainian army are the world’s best warriors. Last time Russian soldiers voted with their feet was in  and things did not go well with the old Tsar. More than a century on, things are not going well for the new Tsar.Putin’s grip on power is weakening by the day as the rest of Russia realises that he no longer has full control of his military machinery. He can huff and bluff buthis soldiers don’t want to kill people, he has a problem. How many people die before good Russia rises up against him is the critical question of our time. In , a Russian BUK missile shot down MH, the Malaysian Boeing jet packed with  holiday makers and crew. I stood in a cornfield in ­pro-Kremlin rebel-held eastern Ukraine surrounded by aircraft engines, the stink of kerosene, paperbacks, plane seats and corpses. That September, thanks to my clever Panorama producer, I was able to pose as a professor at a museum opening and quiz Putin about the shooting down of the passenger jet. He gave one of his long, monotonous replies blaming the Ukrainians for the mass murder he was responsible for. In the flesh, he came across as curiously effeminate. You won’t hear that on Russia Today.  Here Boris Johnson, ever the ­cunning populist, has been banging the ­pro-Ukrainian drum but it’s too little, too late. I have been an enemy of Putin since I saw the evidence of his army’s cruelty in Chechnya in . The European Union quickly threw open its doors to anyone with a Ukrainian passport for the next three years, no questions asked.It was Friday before the British Government followed suit. A Tory minister had said some Ukrainians could come in, so long as they picked fruit. Johnson’s government has been mean with the ordinary poor Ukrainian but sanctions against Putin’s oligarchs have been slow to bite and will probably be easily sidestepped. Roman Abramovich has known links to Putin but his ­biggest yacht has been allowed to slip into ­international waters. The reason is, I believe, that Moscow gold has long been more important to Johnson’s gang than Ukrainian and Russian blood. Johnson and company have made sure “Londongrad” has stayed a safe place for Russian money throughout Putin’s crimes against British people and British interests. On Friday my ordinary email was hacked and the IP address turned out to be somewhere near the Kremlin. I have changed my digital security. When I say the Kremlin is out to get me I’m not being paranoid – it really is.

Alina Kabaeva, one of the most decorated gymnasts in history who won Olympic gold, is hiding out the war in a private chalet “somewhere” in the country famous for its neutrality.Kabaeva is believed to have four children with the Russian president, although he has never confirmed reports.A source told Page Six : “While Putin carries out his assault on the Ukraine, attacking innocent citizens and causing a refugee crisis, his family is holed up in a very private and very secure chalet somewhere in Switzerland – for now, at least.“Alina has two young boys and twin girls with Putin who were born in Switzerland. “The kids all have Swiss passports, and I imagine she does also.” During her rhythmic gymnastic career Kabaeva won two Olympic medals, in Sydney and Athens,  World Championship medals, and  European Championship medals.  Putin is said to despise any intrusion into his private le, which is shrouded in mystery.

Footage of the chopper being downed in a field by a surface-to-air missile emerged amid claims Vladimir Putin has lost around , men in just  days.Former British Army chief General Lord Dannatt told the Sunday Mirror he fears the dictator could turn to nuclear weapons in an attempt to turn the tide. The terrying warning came after Ukrainians posted a clip online showing the chopper – believed to be an MI- Hind Gunship – being shot down in flames by their forces. Follow all of of todayaposs news on the war in Ukraine as it unfolds with our live blog  It crashed to the ground before exploding in a fireball. A caption on the footage said: “Glory to Ukraine.”Earlier, Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky defiantly declared his forces were killing up to , Russian soldiers a day.The death toll is a devastating blow for Russia, which has more than , active personnel.By comparison, the Soviet Union lost around , soldiers in Afghanistan in  years – and that conflict helped fuel the collapse of the communist state.  Ukraine, which is thought to have lost around , troops, also claims hundreds of Russian tanks, armoured vehicles, helicopters and fighter aircraft have been destroyed. Sources said the Kremlin was “demoralised” by the losses and the additional , wounded. Those killed include Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky, , who was shot by a sniper trained just days earlier by the SAS.  Two other senior Russian officers – one isional and one regimental commander – have also perished. Many of the Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine are believed to be just  and poorly trained. POWs have been seen telling their captors they had no idea they were being sent into battle and claimed they thought they were on exercises. Bullying and the abuse of young recruits is also re in the Russian forces.  One source said: “Le for young recruits in the Russian Army is brutal. It is little wonder why so many soldiers are surrendering.” Gen Dannatt told how the Russian generals’ inability to mount a major all-arms operation had been “woefully exposed”. He said: “Moreover, their battlefield leadership has been appalling.  “The absence of clearly explained reasons for the operation to their troops has been verging on criminal – asking young men to risk and lose their lives without knowing why. “Conscripts believed they were going into Ukraine as liberators and peacekeepers and were shocked to find themselves opposed. The true Russian casualty figure will be very high, and probably never known.  “To compound things, it would appear officers have been abandoning their soldiers – trapped in their vehicles on the huge northern convoy – in order to save their own skins. This is a moral and military failure of the highest order.” Gen Dannatt said he believed the war would become a stalemate, but expected Putin’s army to advance further in the coming weeks.He said: “The Russians will start to make some progress as a result of their superior air and fire power. The big battalions usually win. “However, this could all take time and time is not on Putin’s side as sanctions and international isolation begin to bite. There must be a negotiated settlement, but who will facilitate that  Putin hates the West, but he fears China. “The US should be using deniable back channels to talk to the Chinese to persuade them to put an arm around Putin and guide him to the conference table – a ceasefire first, then discussions about Ukraine’s future status, probably a form of neutrality akin to Austria.”  Gen Dannatt warned Putin could fire a tactical or battlefield nuclear weapon to topple Kyiv. He said: “The Russians might consider using a tactical nuclear weapon to break a deadlock – north of Kyiv to gain entry, perhaps. A nightmare scenario.”Last week, Putin announced he had placed his nuclear forces on “high alert” and battles that raged around the remains of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant raised fears of potential nuclear fallout.On Friday, Russian troops were accused of risking a catastrophe after a missile strike at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant caused a fire in an outbuilding.  Putin’s forces have progressed in south and east Ukraine, but an armoured convoy more than  miles long is stuck north of Kyiv. Gen Dannatt said the failure to attack the capital so far suggested Russian chiefs were hoping to “envelop” the city from the south. However, it is thought the convoy’s problems may be hampering plans. Many of the vehicles are believed to have run out of fuel or be stuck in mud and the soldiers are looting local homes for food. Defence sources say Ukrainian ambushes, the destruction of bridges and poor planning have all had an impact. The unfolding horror has forced more than million people to flee Ukraine, but the country’s State Border Guard Service said , men had ed from overseas to fight. Foreign volunteers – including Brits – have also signed up while thousands of Russians are said to have fled to Finland to avoid being conscripted.

Troops from the UK, US and Ukraine have reportedly come together at a remote base in Lithuania to plan the treacherous mission.Russian Spetsnaz special forces are now said to be targeting Zelensky and he has survived three assassination attempts in a week after plots were foiled by double agents. The brave Ukrainian president has also already turned down rescue offers, saying: I need ammunition, not a ride, in response to American forces.It comes as Zelensky confirmed he spoke to the US President, Joe Biden, discussing security, financial support and continuation of sanctions against Russia. As part of the constant dialogue, I had another conversation with the President, Zelensky wrote on Twitter.Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog Around  UK elite soldiers and  US Navy Seals are training for a rescue mission alongside Ukrainian forces, The Sun reports.“The most likely sensible option could be to relocate Zelensky out of Kyiv where he could be picked up. We have aircraft but the distance is critical,” a senior source said.It comes as Vladimir Putin said Western sanctions were akin to a declaration of war, as his forces pressed their assault on Ukraine on Saturday for a th day.The Kremlin said the West was behaving like a bandit by cutting economic relations and Putin warned any attempt to impose a no-fly zone in Ukraine would lead to catastrophic consequences for the world.Meanwhile, Israelaposs Prime Minister Naftali Bennett met with Putin in the Kremlin to discuss the Ukraine crisis, then spoke with Zelensky by phone.Israel has offered to mediate in the conflict.And refugees keep pouring out of the country with number of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion predicted to rise to . million by the end of the weekend, the head of the UN refugee agency s aid. This is the fastest moving refugee crisis we have seen in Europe since the end of World War Two, the UN refugee agency head, Filippo Grandi said. The sanctions have hit me very hard. Prices are already up around % ... you already canapost buy some medicines. Things will get worse, Lidia, a freelance worker from Rostov, describing the impact of sanctions on Russians.

The indiscriminate bombing of civilians we see on our TV screens, reports of Russian soldiers raping Ukrainian women, the ceasefires in which the Russians do not cease firing. And the children in dire need of continuous cancer treatment forced to break off to cower from bombs in basements. Yet despite the pain and anguish, and the odds stacked against them, the people of Ukraine are an inspiration for their resilience and defiance. It takes superhuman courage combined with boiling anger for unarmed civilians to confront trigger-happy Russian soldiers and tell them to clear off.If that was all it took to win this war then the invaders would be scuttling out of the country with their tails between their legs. But that is the stuff of movies, not real le. And Ukrainians must brace themselves for the suffering to get worse as Vladimir Putin tightens the noose around their key cities. There are a number of ways in which this war might be brought to an end, but they grow fewer the longer it goes on. The nightmare scenario is that Putin, frustrated by the lack of progress made by his troops, might turn to battlefield nuclear weapons. He has already shown scant regard for the fallout that would cause, by shelling Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant. It is possible President Xi of China, the only world leader Putin respects, might broker a negotiated settlement. But NATO is less likely to make the concessions that would require, given how Putin’s behaviour has shown the need – more than ever – for a strong defensive alliance. It is possible that ever more restrictive sanctions will convince Putin that withdrawal from Ukraine is preferable to his country’s economy being suffocated. But Western intelligence chiefs are united in the belief that now Putin has gone into Ukraine he cannot come out without a victory, no matter the cost. It is possible that Putin’s own people might get rid of him, so appalled will they be at bodybags piling up and the empty shop shelves they will face in towns and cities. Unlikely as his toppling may seem it would be the best outcome for Ukraine, for Europe and for Russia. But the generals and the spymasters would have to risk their lives to stand up to him. And it would need the oligarchs, stripped of luxury yachts, London mansions, shell companies and other ill-gotten gains, to support them. With Putin gone and a new leader for a new Russia, Ukraine could be ed to its people. With Putin gone the West could reassess its security necessities and open fresh talks over the NATO presence on Russia’s borders. With Putin gone we could once again live in peace and friendship with the Russian people we have no quarrel with. The world would be an infinitely better place, with Putin gone.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

This could be a ground-breaking technique for the global conservation management of golden eagles and other raptors. We will continue to monitor these birds to seethey settle, thrive and breed in the south of Scotland, which will be the real measure of success.“Our work has only been possible due to the support of National Lottery Heritage Fund, our project staff and partners, NatureScot licensing team, raptor specialists, Advisory Panel members, estates, CalMac Ferries and of course the community in the south of Scotland.

Particularly during the twin crises of climate emergency and bioersity loss, it’s wonderful to see a success like this.“Golden eagles are a vital part of Scotland’s wildle, and we’re passionate about ing them to places where they used to thrive. This is brilliant partnership working, and a great support for the local green economy.”The seven new arrivals have been named by a range of iniduals, school children and organisations.

The mine was finally rediscovered by HMS Bicester early last week.Bad weather made it impossible for the crew of the Bicester to attach a surface riser to it and the mine was left to a Navy ing team to bring it up.Led by Lt Adrian Dann, the four-man Northern Diving Team from Faslane finally pinpointed the mine on Tuesday morning and brought it up later that day.The two-tonne mine is currently lying on the New Quay waiting to be picked up by the mine laying team from Cromby, Fe.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown churchgoers, in common with other congregations throughout the country, are being asked to sign petition forms calling for an end to public filth in television and literature.Already many people, including non-churchgoers, have appended their names to the forms which are also in several businesses in the town.The forms are headed: ‘Petition for public decency.’It states: ‘Being concerned about the effect on society – particularly on the young – and of the increasing exploitation of sex, the public portrayal of intimate or unnatural sexual behaviour and violence and brutality, we the undersigned call upon Her Majesty’s government: to note the concern of the public about this matter. to ensure that the law as regards of sanity stops this public affront and is so designed as to be an effective instrument for the maintenance of public decency.Some church congregations in the town have already begun signing the petition and others planned to follow suit in the near future.All of Campbeltown’s ministers are in agreement that the obscenities on television and in literature are going too far, and hope that the petition has the desired effect.The Reverend James W Hood, of Lorne Street Church, commented yesterday: ‘I think it is perfectly right that the church should be given the opportunity of speaking its mind.’SEVENTY YEARS AGOThe majesty and pomp of King George VI#s funeral procession through London, and later its journey to Windsor Castle, was seen and heard by people in Campbeltown and Tarbert on Friday, in the history-making experimental television broadcast.In both places, reception was remarkably clear and those who were privileged to see it saw this royal journey of dignied and poignant pageantry in a much greater detail than the vast crowds in London and Windsor.At both places, the sets, with -inch screens, were shown by radio dealers to parties of friends.Mr Anthony P MacGrory, Campbeltown town councillor and housing convener, had his set installed in the radio showroom of his firm’s shop in Main Street.At Tarbert, the set there was arranged by Mr Douglas C Smith, Electrical and Radio Engineer, Harbour Street.Earlier last month, Mr Smith informed us that he was getting surprisingly good results from the test from the Scottish television station at Kirk o’ Shotts – the Scottish station which is using only low power transmission.Scottish TV reception of this historical occasion was the previous day viewed with serious misgivings and doubts by BBC experts, who pointed out that the Kirk o’ Shotts station was not due to open until March  and that this is the first-ever television radio link up, connecting Scotland to London, through Manchester, was merely an experiment and the Scottish transmitters were still undergoing adjustment.So, until the TV programme went onto the air on Saturday, the BBC could give no guarantee that the venture would be successful.It was a great success and thousands of Scots over a wide area, from Dumfries to Aberdeen, saw clear pictures of the funeral processions.At Campbeltown and Tarbert, the pictures were almost as clear as everyone was looking at them on the cinema screen, the detail in some of the pictures being unbelievably perfect.One local businessman, who saw it, described it as ‘uncanny’.But, throughout the years, this has been the descriptive of all great inventions when they first made their impact on the public mind.It was a pity, of course, that this great moment in Scottish television progress should have been heralded in with such a sad event as the funeral of our King.Considering that Kintyre was not regarded as a good reception area and that this  miles relay was the longest ever attempted by the BBC, the result was truly amazing and will no doubt mean the booking of many orders from this part of the country.Already, Mr McGrory has been receiving enquiries from ious parts of Argyll.We were privileged to see the screening in Mr MacGrory’s premises that afternoon. The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television network, it must have been an unforgettable experience to have this outstanding London ceremonial brought hundreds of miles to before their eyes and to be taken in imagination straight to Windsor to watch the Royal coffin being carried out and upon it the Imperial State Crown, the orb and the sceptre and the white wreath of orchids, camellias and lilies of the valley from Her Majesty, the Queen

What#s inside the singing kettle # # which Artie still uses today.While this principle was always central to the action, plot lines and stage sets were built around imaginative story lines, transforming the original concept into a spectacular musical for the whole family.The Singing Kettle turned children’s theatre into an art form and the troupe#s unique performances became the bench mark for fellow professionals everywhere.They performed in hundreds of venues, from the Palladium in London to the Town Hall in Campbeltown, from the Palace Theatre in Kilmarnock to the Royal Palace in Jordan.BAFTA-award winning and decorated with MBEs for services to children’s entertainment, audiences worldwide were hooked on their madcap musical adventures flavoured with cheeky Scottish humour.Adults and children alike found themselves singing the songs together long after the performances were over.The company closed in , with the final line-up forming Fun Box and with Cilla retiring.Artie continued performing solo shows as Artie#s Tartan Tales but since the beginning of  his show is now Artie#s Singing Kettle.There is a £ one price ticket for the show, plus booking fee.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a vegetable plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is your key to successful growing and means that you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and vegetable beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing directly into the ground at this time of year, there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option not only does it provide a warm environment for germination but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests.If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, then even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"minato-sushi-cheese-lady-boost-haddington-town-centre","story":"The Cheese Lady on Haddington High Street is moving into the former butcher premises of Colin D Peat on neighbouring Court Street.The move from High Street has opened the door for Minato Sushi to bring the Japanese delicacy to the town centre.The changing face of the town centre was welcomed by councillors Tom Trotter and John McMillan, with the new businesses set to open this summer.Jen Kerr, of Minato Sushi, stressed there was still plenty of work ahead at the business before the doors opened.The -year-old, of Port Seton, who will run the business with her boyfriend Tom Cuddy, described it as “a real dream come true”.She said: “We are really excited.

Scott Fitzgerald’s classic novel The Great Gatsby.More than one person staying informed us that the hotel hadn’t always been that way but, after a dramatic refurbishment last year, the move from bleak to chic has been swt and drastic.The Marine now offers  guest rooms, two unique food and beverage concepts, a spa, pool and fitness centre, and , square feet of flexible meeting and event spaces.Overlooking the th hole of the historic West Links course of North Berwick Golf Club, it boasts scenic views of landmarks including the Firth of Forth and Bass Rock.The panoramic and clear views of sea from the hotel are even betteryou’re lucky enough to catch the East Lothian weather on a good day.But though rainy and bleak during our stay, the views were equally breathtaking. With the lobby offering seating – and a coffee and cocktail service! – and a large welcome desk in the centre of the room, even the reception does its best to cater to the view. It would be easy to spend an entire afternoon in the lobby alone, getting lost in the town’s beauty.Its fair to say, the ‘Grand Old Lady’ is back to her former glory and better than ever...Marine Hotel, North Berwick Set on Cromwell Road, The Marine Hotel North Berwick occupies a prime position just streets away from the town’s charming beach and harbour. Its buttercream stone facade is easy to locate and its large free parking area means carrying luggage to the door is a breeze.For tourists and visitors, the hotel is in a prime position within walking distance of a iety of restaurants, some of which serve the freshest seafood from the harbour, alongside fish and chip takeaways and the well-loved and always popular Alandas Gelato.Upon entry to the hotel foyer, guests will be blown away by the sublime views out of large open windows of the iconic Bass Rock.The revamped Marine Hotel, North Berwick There’s ample free parking, a large restaurant, bar area, spa facilities, free Wi-Fi and more.The lobby at night The design throughout the hotel takes inspiration from Scotland’s world-renowned golf courses and notable figures, with nods to the hotel’s stunning seaside location and surrounding natural wonders.A deep colour palette dominates here: the lobby is a mixed wash of patterned wallpaper and dark emerald window fittings. Seating areas boast a selection of large leather couches and intimate tables of two – both of which offer stunning views of the waters that make North Berwick so popular.The hotel embraces the beauty of the wilderness on its front door, with interiors pulling from the agricultural and architectural history of the area. Local heritage is displayed through framed prints of wildle found on the Bass Rock. The refurbished style is reminiscent of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic The Great Gatsby.The lobby area boasts walls of literature As a perfect location for tourists and local visitors alike, there was a iety of visitors checking in: in the lobby, a mix of young couples and groups of friends, as well as solo visitors with their beloved pooches, socialised.The service was relaxed and without fault. Reception staff were friendly and engaging, recommending restaurants and sight-seeing activities.During checkout, staff members went above and beyond to cater to guests’ needs, with several carrying luggage out to the car park and ensuring checkout was as speedy and calm as possible.Bedside tables reflect the hotels golfing roots The hotel boasts  guest rooms, with many paying homages to iconic golf holes with nightstands designed as golf tee boxes. Guest room carpet complements the nightstands and depicts golf ball and golf club mots within the traditional pattern.Each room is somewhat unique but adheres to the core theme by using pops of deep colour and golfing mots to reflect its sporting heritage.All rooms – Marine King Suite, Marine Deluxe King Seaview, Marine Deluxe King, Marine Classic Double Seaview, Marine Classic Double – come with sizeable bathrooms, high-end toiletries, storage space, iron, safe, coffee and tea, concierge service and a mini-bar.My only criticism is the not-so-subtle patterned wallpaper featured in a number of bedrooms. I would avoid thoseyou are prone to migraines!Haggis Bonbons made a great starter The Marine’s restaurant, The Lawn, offers erse dining options and an extensive all-day menu showcasing the very best of Scottish cuisine. Main courses include options of venison, halibut and duck breast.The quality of the food is a definite selling point I’d recommend the haggis bonbons to start, while the Tweed valley beef with Chimichurri sauce makes for an admirable main course.The only distraction in the dining area was the rather bleak music played throughout dinner. Additionally, I would recommend a late dinner, with the atmosphere of the eatery heating up at around pm.Breakfast is a generous premium buffet served in the restaurant with an additional menu of warm and cooked items the French toast is not to be missed. From my understanding, the pastries on offer at the buffet are made in house and the best I’ve ever eaten.The overall dining experience at The Lawn was high class, most of all due to the eagerness and humour of our server. If you visit The Lawn, with or without a booked stay at The Marine, always ask for Richie!Cocktails created by talented bar staff are the perfect dinner treat Staff are faultless in their presentation, their unorm neat and matching they’re eager to help and accommodate.Marine Hotel North Berwick Without a doubt, the staff are among the most polite and caring I have ever met. A special mention goes to Surajit Dasgupta for his outstanding care and attention throughout the stay. His service alone would justy booking a night’s stay at The Marine.The atmosphere and charm of this hotel is so special that, despite living just a few miles down the road, it felt like a well-needed break from day-to-day le. This does not give you the routine chain hotel vibe, instead a comfortable stay high up on my list of places to . Huge respect to the Marine team, who do a great job here a true example of excellent hospitality!"},{"url":null,"title":"quiet-roads-coming-county","story":"East Lothian Council’s Labour-led cabinet is being asked to decide whether to keep the the limits and introduce a new hierarchy of speed restrictions on its roads orto pre-pandemic rules.A new speed limit policy also proposes introducing Quiet Roads in the county which would have signs urging drivers to go slower on lanes which are being used by pedestrians and cyclists.The new policy follows a survey of residents last year which the council says saw six out of  people say they believed the lower speed limits have made it safer for children, with more than half keen to keep them in some,not all, places.However it also found  per cent of residents said drivers ignored the speed limits and more than half said drivers took more risks and were frustrated by the slower speeds, with  per cent having the view that speed limits were not enforced.However  per cent of people questioned said they believed drivers paid more attention to other road users due to reduced speed limits and were less likely to overtake cyclists with a third adding they found it easier to cross roads.: Public urged to have their say on mph zonesThe proposed hierarchy of speeds in East Lothian’s towns would see mph limits on roads on the outskirts of communities, with mph roads described as streets where vehicles are given a higher priority than the “place ”.Speed limits of mph would be introduced in residential streets or those with a high pedestrian or cyclist movement such as town centres or around schools.The policy also covers ways for communities to apply for changes to speed limits in their areas.And it introduces the designation of popular walking areas as Quiet Roads.It says: “Quiet Roads are increasingly being implemented on rural roads across Scotland where there may be high levels of use by pedestrians, cyclists or equestrians.“The presence of vulnerable road users in the carriageway is highlighted to drivers through the use of signage to promote a shared environment.“Where appropriate, East Lothian Council will consider the introduction of Quiet Roads across its network to develop safer movements for vulnerable road users.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mothers-day-gifts-2022-coffee-machines-mugs-gift-sets","story":"Mothers Day, which falls on Sunday, March  in , is a whole day dedicated to celebrating mothers, grandmothers and other maternal figures.For those addicted to coffee and caffiene treats, theres plenty of choice - from affordable gt sets to fancy coffee machines.From Mothers Day presents under £ to Nespresso and Lavazzo luxury, were sure youll find the perfect gt right here.Photo of a woman enjoying coffee via Canva Pixabay.

But, despite being from Nepal, he had only recently discovered the food of his home country himself.Having left his village of Karjanha and family at just  to move to India and work as a kitchen porter, he progressed to chef, and Indian food was what he cooked - and what he knew - for  years.\"Before I was calling [myself] an Indian chef,\" Shah says. \"What do you cook  Indian food. Where do you work  Indian restaurants. What kind of chef are you  Im an Indian chef.\"But before his stint on BBCs MasterChef, he started to research the cooking techniques and produce of Nepal, and the experience has been a real homecoming to the food he once cooked with his mother as a child.\"I was so amazed with the cooking and food we have... from the fermentation to pickling, the dumplings, the bread, high-altitude food, low-altitude food, fire cooking, lots of meat, lots of fish,\" he says. \"Im thinking, why didnt I do this before \"Now, no, no more - everything Nepali. Im a Nepali chef. What do you cook  Nepalese food.\"Hes on a mission to \"contribute Nepalese food to the world\" via his debut cookbook, Ayla, and plans to open a fine dining Nepali restaurant in London.Theres a misunderstanding, he says, that Nepalese food is very similar to Indian, which borders three sides of the country. \"Its totally dferent. India is such a big country - even one state is bigger than Nepal,\" he says, andyoure a small country next to a big country, youre always going to be subject to their stature.Of course, some influence does come from its neighbours, which also include China , Pakistan, Burma and Bhutan, Shah explains. But the secret is really in Nepals unique geography and bioersity.\"Where I come from, the Siraha region, it would be C now, andI travelled north km, it would be minus [temperatures]. So you can imagine, km from every part of Nepal, what food is growing, the vegetables, the meat, everything is changed.\"From the arid high altitudes of the Himalayas, to the band of rich green valleys and rivers, and the tropical grasslands of Terai in the south, the crops and livestock farmed are erse. A largely Hindu country with at least  languages spoken, \"every community has dferent food, dferent ingredients and a dferent way to make flavour,\" Shah says.But whether its street foodlike kukhura ko momoor festival specialities like terai malpua ra rabri , you can be sure of the sophisticated use of spices.What surprises a lot of people is, for a landlocked country, there is a huge fish cookery culture. \"People say, Do you really have a lot of fish  Yes we do - big fish, small fish, so tasty,\" Shah says with a laugh. Water running down from the Himalayas means river fish are not only in abundance, but many species are indigenous to Nepal.Rohu is the most famous, but the firm texture of monkfish makes a perfectly good substitute for home cooking in the UK, for Shahs poleko machha ra jholrecipe, for example.And while his book celebrates the wild boar, buffalo meat and jungle fowl thats so crucial to Nepali cuisine, they can all be substituted for easier-to-source meats, he says.Fermentation, pickling and sun-drying, meanwhile, are processes born out of necessity in Nepal. \"Even in my village,  or  years ago, they didnt have electricity, so we didnt have a freezer to keep anything in,\" Shah explains. Its also important during monsoons, which can have a devastating effect on agriculture in the south. Gundruk, made using mustard leaves, is the countrys most famous preserve, and youll find it dotted through Shahs recipes.The MasterChef: Professionals finalist - who also won MasterChef: The Professionals Rematch Special in  - has come a long way from his early childhood in Karjanha.\"When I was young, everybody had to cook at home. Im from a very poor family background, we had one big room, there was a kitchen in a corner, in another corner there was a bed - like a studio flat here,\" he says. But there was a lot of people in that one space - Shah is the youngest of seven siblings. \"I have five brothers and two sisters when everybody got married and left the village, my mother was there cooking and I was always next to her, [shed say] Cut this one, cut that one.\"In Nepal,you are poor then you have a vegetable garden. Rich people buy from the market, poor people grow their own. So we had everything in our garden. Whenever my mother was cooking, I would go and pick [vegetables] from the backyard, come into the kitchen and wash them with my mother,\" he recalls.After finishing school at , he didnt have the money to go any further in education, heading for the bright lights of India instead. \"I was amazed to see that big hotel, that many people working as chefs, the kitchen, everything,\" Shah says.After six months, he asked the head chef for a chance to cook and thats when his culinary journey really took off - moving to the UK in , where one of his first jobs was at Brasserie Blanc, owned by Raymond Blanc, before working at Michelin-starred Benares, becoming head chef at Cinnamon Kitchen and executive chef at the five-star LaLit Hotel in London.\"I love cooking. Apart from cooking, I dont know anything,\" he says, with that jolly laugh you cant mistake.Ayla: A Feast Of Nepali Dishes From Terai, Hills And The Himalayas by Santosh Shah is published by DK, priced £.

Staff went on strike on the first day I started. In the days of Teletext, it came up the night before ‘library staff are going on strike to meet the new director.’ For a moment I thought what a shame, but that was me,” said Dr McConnell.Read more: Glasgow aid for Ukraine appeal is launched - how you can help“Glasgow has always felt special to me and when I got the job here I couldn’t believe it. One thing I didn’t appreciate that being in Glasgow the press are much more interested than you would have imagined. That was quite a shock and took quite a bit of getting used to.“What I did know that in the city, politically, all the political parties really did want the city to succeed and that’s what I wanted to work with – that whole thing of widening access.”  After  years at the helm of it the city’s culture and leisure services, firstly under Glasgow City Council and then as chief executive of arms- organisation Glasgow Le, Dr McConnell is due to retire in May.However, she is not winding down just yet and has the small matter of the £million revamped Burrell Collection to reopen later this month. It is the latest high profile museum to open under her tenure following on from the refurbishment Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, and the opening of the Riverside Museum. Under her leadership culture and sport attendances have grown by a third to more than  million in the year before the pandemic. Glasgow Le Museums became the most used and visited museums service in Scotland, but it’s not all been plane sailing.Losing tens of millions of pounds during the local government shake up meant services were competing for any cash they could get. Library staff were on strike for eight months in the late s and venues were open for just a couple of days a week to lend books and it was looking grim for the future of those services.Read more: Craig Mallon murder: New twist as appeal made for mystery callerHowever, an opportunity to work with the then Glasgow Development Agency who had money to invest in technology began to turn things around.  Mrs McConnell, who is married to former First Minister Jack McConnell, added: “Performance indicators in our libraries were among the worst in the UK at the time, but we got through it and persuaded the council and GDA to come in and develop learning suites with computers, train up staff and in some places co-locate, which for some people is still an issue, but it was fantastic. There was objection at the time, but within weeks uncertain staff became the biggest advocate and more people were using the service.“There was no library in the Gorbals it had been shut many years before and we reopened that. We ended up extending the library service. In Pollok the library was literally falling down so we located it in the leisure centre. In Springburn we had problems with the old library building and eventually we created a two-level library with a computer suite. With co-location we had more people using the service.”An element of Mrs McConnell’s role was look at future partnerships and who  they could work with and it is how she first met the late Lord Macfarlane, who was a passionate patron of the arts in Glasgow and helped them raise £millon for the £m Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum refurbishment. He also helped the council buy the handwritten original Robert Burns manuscript of ‘Auld Lang Syne’ in  for around £,.“It came up for sale in New York and one of the library staff said to me this was happening,” said Mrs McConnell. “They said we have this amazing Burns collection but you never buy anything in Glasgow for the libraries and I thought why not “We went out and we got that manuscript at auction in New York and it is now in Glasgow. That has been at the heart of what we have been able to do. It has been about working with others and seeing opportunities as they arise. In the face of it when I started in  having lost all that money from Strathclyde and sadly we did have to make a lot of compulsory redundancies at the time, the reality iswe hadn’t gone into partnership with others and hadn’t changed how we did things we wouldn’t have had the credibility or the partners to do a lot of what we did.”It was former city council chief executive George Black who recognised that the halcyon days would not last forever and understood what was coming down the line in terms of the scale of investment for services and reductions in local government funding.In  that it was felt for culture and leisure to be successful a new way of working had to be looked and also to reduce the burden to the council given increasing demands on the likes of social care and education budgets.  This led to the setting up of Glasgow Le in , a charitable organisation that could run culture and leisure on behalf of the council, and brought an immediate saving to the council of tens of millions of pounds just in rates, along with VAT benefits.“We also recognised it would be a way of bringing in people like Lord Macfarlane on to our board,” added Mrs McConnell. “We saw this as an opportunity immediately to save money year in year out – one off saving isn’t enough and we needed to bring in people who could help us bring in additional money.”Read more: Architect behind Burrell Collection redesign says it has opened up the heart of the buildingGlasgow’s cultural and sporting successes propelled the city’s global reputation as a first choice leisure and business tourism destination. In , before the pandemic struck, Glasgow welcomed some . million domestic and international visitors boosting the city’s economy by a record £m and supporting thousands of jobs across every part of Glasgow’s tourism and hospitality sector.However, the pandemic meant the doors to Glasgow Le’s venues were closed and it was facing a financial black hole. It lost £m due to the pandemic and estimated revenue for   was £.m. With services and cultural attractions at risk, it led to The Herald launching A Fair Deal for Glasgow campaign calling for both the UK and Scottish government to support a new way of funding these treasures.So how does she think Glasgow can best funds its cultural offering in the years ahead.“Glasgow isn’t just like any other local authority. It is dferent. It is the biggest city and is home to so many cultural services and resources that it directly funds through Glasgow Le, but the whole ecology whether it is support for the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, based in one of the city’s venues or the Glasgow Warriors playing at Scotstoun, it goes beyond direct funding. I believe there needs to be recognition that some of these services are nationally and internationally signicant and should be funded accordingly,” said Mrs McConnell.“I think we need to look at a dferent view of public health. It can’t just be about campaigns to stop smoking, it needs to be about how can you live a healthy le in your community and that means local resources, services whether it is libraries, sports, or development staff. We need advocates to look at ideas for the future and there needs to be a sense of urgency that we need to do something more.”  Her passion for culture and widening access, she says, stems from its ability to change people’s lives and goes back generations for Mrs McConnell whose inspiration was her grandmother Bridget Airlie, whose name appears on a remembrance plaque in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.“My grandmother was a miner’s we, had seven children and her father before her was a miner. She had six daughters and one son who was killed in the pits.“She was born in  and lived until she was . She had a huge family who were involved in the pits. Relatives had died from having lung disease – I had great uncles who were like demi-gods - grumpy and gruff - but I loved them and the stories they would tell as boys being in a pit at the age of  crawling in areas which were ft high.“Her passion was for education and my memory of her was stick in at school as this was the way out of the pits for her. For me history from  right through the th century wasn’t just in a book. I heard it and lived it listening to these people. I can remember my Uncle Thomas, who was killed in the pits when he was , his we was pregnant at the time and lost the baby, he would listen to opera such as La Traviata.“I remember during the miners’ strike, I had a lot of relations who were involved in that, there was always this dilemma – there was the pride of the mining communities but actually they didn’t want that for their kids. They wanted somewhere where they could breathe, live and they could use their brains. The thing that really struck me about my gran, who was in service as a young girl, was her teacher trying to plead with her parents about to let her stay on at school, but they were poor. Being in service wasn’t like being in Upstairs Downstairs, I think it was pretty miserable, but here was this bright woman who could recite Wordsworth and there was this sense of a great mind not challenged enough so she lived it through her children and grandchildren. The mantra for her was education, education, education. There was a passion about access to arts and that it should be there for everyone and that still drives me to this day.”  While she recognises she is extremely privileged now, she was brought up in a room and kitchen with her siblings and an outside toilet shared with another family, but she said she never once felt poor.“I felt rich and it was rich in community, the church was a big thing for us and lot of the social le, entertainment and arts experiences stemmed from there. I ended up playing organ in the Twechar Church for six years from the age of  because my gran had bought the organ in memory of her late son. I can remember the opportunities there were growing up. If I hadn’t had a full grant when I went to university I wouldn’t have been able to go.”Her first job after leaving St Andrew’s University was with Fe Council’s travelling art gallery in .  Despite the headline grabbing achievements of multi-million pound museums opening and her role in helping to bring the Commonwealth Games to the city in , which she is immensely proud of, it is some of the initiatives that have been le-changing that mean the most.“For me it is the little things. We were doing some work at the library in Bridgeton and one man talked about how the library saved his le. He had lost his job, felt suicidal, and it wasn’t just that the library provided a safe space, it is the moment when it gave a reason for living.“Seeing the change in some of the young people from the criminal justice reform programme volunteering at the Commonwealth Games – it was a moment when you see how culture and sport can change lives.\"As she looks to the future what’s next for Mrs McConnell – does she see a future in politics. And her response was not a yes, no or maybe – it was a never.“It is not a no – it is a never,\" she declared. \"Politics doesn’t appeal partly because I like to change my mind a lot, but I also have found that across all the political parties it is about being able to work with a common interest in doing more for local communities and for people. If you can work with that across parties as sometimes my experience is that parties can create ides, so no it is a never for me.”"},{"url":null,"title":"wool-can-help-preserve-footpaths-natural-environment","story":"But while once farmers and crofters could rely on fleece to bring in a healthy income, cheaper imports, the loss of processing mills and slump in demand sent wool prices tumbling.The problem reached a peak last year, with farmers reportedly having to pay to have wool removed from their land, with piles of fleece being burned or thrown away.Now, however, a Skye crofter has tested a potential ‘carpet’ solution that would not only provide a new and sustainable use for wool but could help to regenerate Scotland’s precious peatlands.Instead of Skye wool being used to create sumptuous carpets for homes, it has been successfully used to create a thick and water repellent ‘underlay’ for an outdoor path across a peaty bog, opening the door to wool becoming a sustainable alternative to traditional plastic-based material.It has also raised hopes that the glut of wool can also be used to help rewet peatlands: tests have been carried out where involving stuffing wool into drains, securing it in place and creating an environment for sphagnum mosses to thrive and the bog to regenerate.Currently some peatland restoration projects use plastic membrane lining to prevent water draining away or involve digging deep trenches which have to be repacked with peat. That process tends to involve the use of heavy machinery, which itself can damage delicate peat environments.The wool carpet was used at a m stretch of the Kilmarie coastal path at Strathaird on the Isle of Skye, which had become particularly muddy. The path, which is looked after by the John Muir Trust, is regularly used by the community and visitors to the Iron Age fort at Dùn Ringill, and takes walkers on a scenic route past Kilmarie House, owned and lived in until  by Ian Anderson, singer and flautist with Jethro Tull.Normally the repair work would involve laying plastic membrane topped with gravel, or wood which eventually rots.However, Skye crofter and John Muir Trust Skye team member John MacRae decided to switch the plastic for sheep wool to create a ‘floating path’.The technique can be traced back to the Roman Empire, when fleeces were used in road building to create a layer on waterlogged ground. Wool was also used in the construction of railway lines in Ireland a century ago.Mr MacRae sourced around  raw and unprocessed fleeces from local crofts including around  from his own flock to use an alternative to geotextile matting.The fleeces were folded and rolled before being laid along  metres of the path, with the remaining  metres covered in the plastic-based matting in order to check how they compared.The wool-based method protects the peat and soil, allows the easy drainage of water and prevents the gravel on top from sinking into the mud.The solution is now being considered for other island paths and at other sites run by the John Muir Trust, which looks after some of Scotland’s best known sites including Ben Nevis, East Schieallion and Quinag, a mountain range in Assynt, Sutherland.The Trust maintains around km of footpaths on the Isle of Skye.Mr MacCrae said the use of wool as a foundation material for outdoor paths is at odds with days when he was growing up and wool fetched premium prices.“Older crofters talk about how the wool cheque would be enough to pay your farm rent for the whole year,” he said.“I remember as a child being told to go out and walk around the fences to pick up any spare wool, because it had a value and was worth collecting.“But the price is now so low that these days there have been people just dumping it because they can’t sell it.“I know that people this year were just going to dispose of their wool anyway they could because in theory it would have cost them money to get it to distributors or wholesalers.“I have got about  sheep, and this has helped me to get my wool away and make space in my sheds.”Farmers and crofters told The Herald on Sunday last August how they had been left earning little more than pennies, and in some cases making no money at all, for their sheep’s fleeces.In at least one case, a Western Isle crofter ended owing money to the British Wood Board money after the costs of transporting his fleece was deducted from its price.Others reported being paid little more than the equivalent price of a takeaway coffee for wool shorn from around  ewes, leading to some farmers throwing fleeces on the ground as matting to provide grip on muddy gateways, burying them, or even burning them.The collapse in price has been partly blamed on the pandemic and a slump in demand from carpet and mattress manufacturers which most ‘rough’ Scottish fleece is often used for.Using unwanted wool as a floating underlayer for paths in boggy areas and in peatland restoration would introduce a more sustainable alternative to plastic-based matting and ert fleece from landfill.Mr MacRae added: “In the past people would have used branches or beech logs to stop gravel and stones sinking in peaty areas.“This is the first time I’ve used wool and it’s very much a trial, but it’s worked really well and everything I can find suggests it will last a very long time.“All the time I was working on the path, I was thinking about where the geotextile material had come from, what it cost in terms of carbon to make and get to Skye, whereas the wool was a local product, essentially free and hasn’t had to travel to get here.”"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13547466.jpg?type=article-full","title":"hermit-treig-ken-smith-ventures-glasgow-first-time-40-years","story":"Ken Smith has spent the past four decades living in a log cabin nestled near Loch Treig in Lochaber.

Those affected are being informed. There are further staffing challenges in adult social work and Occupational Therapy.Ms Green continued: “The closure of any service is as a last resort, but we have no choice to ensure we can safely manage to run our residential care facilities. The situation will be monitored closely and as soon as we are in a position to reopen safely then we will let everyone know.“Our care staff and the families of residents have done an outstanding job in keeping this virus at bay and out with our care facilities up until recent times but given the widespread transmission and the reduction in restrictions it has meant it was almost inevitable that this was going to happen at some point.”Staffing challenges are also being felt across the Leisure and Culture service, with some gym and swimming pool sessions and exercise classes being cancelled. The council-run St Magnus Café, Community Centre, and Town Hall have also been affected by closures and reduced opening hours.A plan has been agreed to ensure some level of service continues at the popular cafe during this challenging period and is being trialled this weekuntil the end of March, opening from .-.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe Wolfe Tones during a previous performance in Falls Park.Michael Kenwood, Local Democracy ReporterMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe DUP and Sinn Fein have clashed over the Wolfe Tones Féile concerts in Falls Park, after Belfast City Council agreed to give events in public parks an annual review.At the recent monthly meeting of the full council, elected members agreed that events in city parks that seek multiple year approval will be subject to a review after each programme is finished.The agreement by elected members is a pre-policy position, in advance of the council agreeing a more structured framework and policy for events, which is currently being prepared by council officers.During a restricted discussion, away from the public and press at the council’s People and Communities Committee last month, elected members moved away from a proposal for equality impact assessments to be undertaken in regard to inidual events on council land, specically in relation to the Féile an Phobail Festival. During a party group leader meeting later it was decided to move towards an annual review for all recurring events.DUP councillor Brian Kingston said at the City Hall meeting this week: “We are happy for these recommendations to go through as approved at committee. But we will say again regarding Féile An Phobail and the use of Falls Park, that for a number of events, despite the vast majority being positive, there does continue to be a problem.”He referred specically to “the use of a council park where there is a concert, and from the stage, there is singing, and the leading of young people, and the chanting of support for paramilitary organisations”.He said: “I am referring to the Wolfe Tones concert in Falls Park, in our park. There is nothing  on the same scale as this.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up He added: “We will continually ask what steps are being made to change the nature of this event. People can look at the nature of the footage and judge for themselves, and decideit is acceptable in a council park.”Sinn Fein councillor Matt Garrett told the chamber: “Whenever we moved from committee we moved from having an equality impact assessment carried out on particular events, and in particular Féile, to having all organisations holding events being reminded of their good relations policy.”He responded to Mr Kingston: “You make reference to Féile all the time, and while you say every time you will get up and make that point, we will also remind yourself, as a party, that all events across the city have to enter a contract. All the good relations and impacts are discussed in that.”He said: “If we are going to move to the point of having equality impacts on every inidual, we can’t support that, and we would call for them across all.”Mr Kingston asked Mr Garrett: “Do you not accept there is a problem  This event is on a scale unlike any other, where there is chanting for paramilitaries, young people being led from the stage. Chanting for the organisation that caused Bloody Friday, that we have agreed to commemorate this year.”Mr Garrett replied: “Would you equally agree there are events that are happening in parks and spaces in this city, owned by the council, that are equally as annoying to other members of the community ”Mr Kingston said: “If this was happening not on a council park it wouldn’t be our business. We can’t please all of society. If we have to challenge people’s behaviour, so be it. But there is nothing in parallel with this event. I will say again, we want to see progress being made, it being accepted by the organisers, and the parties on this council, that this is a stain on the council and the Féile.”Until the finalised policy is agreed, after the annual review of each event, the council’s Director of Neighbourhood Services will decide on appropriate changes to event management where necessary, including the removal of permissionrequired.Agreed at the council were the AVA Festival Bespoke Campsite on June  and  at Victoria Park, the Féile an Phobail annual events programme at Falls Park and Dunville Park, the Circus Extreme from October  to November  at Boucher Road Playing Fields, and the Belfast Beer and Cider Festival from May  to  at Botanic Gardens.Most ReadNorthern Ireland cop John Fleming facing jail over cruelty to pet dogs caught on dashcamIRA man Anthony Doherty, linked to deaths of three Scottish soldiers, dies in Dublin hospitalRevealed: The cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsGAA player’s family hit by second tragedyDUP and Sinn Fein clash over Wolfe Tones Féile concertsTop VideosPlayWatch: Piano player lightens mood at Ukrainian refugee camp with #Somewhere Over the Rainbow# PlayVideo: Inside Northern Ireland#s only non-ROC Nuclear bunkerPlayWillie Frazer: Fenian-looking people are watching me [video]Latest Northern IrelandWoman escapes injury after pipe bomb explodes outside Londonderry houseAlmost , patients in NI have been sent to ‘long Covid’ clinicsA ‘short’ route to fame for Belfast actress Roisin Gallagher as she lands lead role in TV series The Dry alongside Ciarán HindsStabbing of pharmacist in north Belfast attack condemnedLondonderry security alert ends after viable pipe-bomb foundLatestWoman escapes injury after pipe bomb explodes outside Londonderry houseTikTok blocks new videos in Russia to avoid media crackdownQuestion Time to host special episode on war in UkraineBelfast Giants complete six-point weekend over Guildford Flames to move two clear at the top of the tableDenmark to hold referendum on joining EU’s common defence,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This proposal suggests this review would be triggered and full implementation required for any punter placing a bet in excess of £.Can you imagine the implications of such a proposal  It’s simply not practical and that is just one example of the proposed Codes of Practice our members have raised firm opposition to.”Representatives from both Downpatrick and Down Royal racecourses have written to the DfC expressing their specic concerns. In it#s submission to DfC#s consultation, the AIR said members have “concerns that the adoption of the draft Codes of Practice would have a drastic effect on the income that they currently receive from bookmakers which, in turn, comprises such a signicant share of their funding that it could call into question their continued existence”.Down Royal Racecourse chief Emma Meehan said horse racing is in a unique sporting position, in that it and betting are inter-dependent with most of their revenue streams linked to betting.Whilst we agree the act needs modernising and developing to ensure it is fit for the modern age in a sector that has been transformed through the rise of mobile and online gaming, we are gravely concerned over the potential impact this proposed legislation will have upon the future of horse racing within Northern Ireland a sport that is still recovering from the financial implications of Covid-,” she said.DfC said: The Minister is currently bringing a Bill – The Betting, Gaming, Lotteries and AmusementsBill through the Assembly.“The Bill includes a power to allow the Department to issue Codes of Practice. A pre-design engagement consultation was conducted on a draft Code of Practice and closed on February .The department is currently analysing the responses with a view to revising the Code of Practice and issuing for a further formal consultation later in the year.

He has previously labelled the proposals to move the four wards as ldquototally unacceptable.Mr McGrath contends there is no historical, cultural, economic or educational link between Downpatrick and Comber or Newtownards, areas currently in the Strangford constituency that would be in the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency.He said other political parties have made their stance clear via their respective submissions to the Commission, but was left ldquoaghast with Sinn Feinrsquos response which indicated that it was content with a number of areas including Malone Heights, Roughal Park, the Strangford Road, Ardenlee and Saul Acres developments and all of Saul and Strangford being removed from South Down to form part of the suggested new constituency.ldquoThe net result would be residents on either side of the Saul Road voting in dferent constituencies and I cannot comprehend the rationale for this, said Mr McGrath.The MLA said when he makes his presentation today, he will make it clear to the Commission ldquoin no uncertain terms that the proposal to move the four Downpatrick wards and much of Crossgar, Annacloy and Teconnaught into the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency is ldquounacceptable.He added: ldquoLet us retain our links with places like Castlewellan, Newcastle and the wider South Down area and do not use Downpatrick as a scapegoat for their attempts to address wider electoral issues in Belfast or other parts of the North..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"150th anniversary of Downpatrick church  ","story":"THE Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh is to speak in Downpatrick to mark the th anniversary of St Patrickrsquos Church in the town.Archbishop Eamon Martin will celebrate mass on March th as part of a special St Patrickrsquos Novena mdash nine days of prayer mdash in the church where generations of Catholics have worshipped since .Poor Clares Sr Martina Purdy and Sr Elaine Kelly mdash who pioneered St Patrickrsquos Camino walk in Downpatrick two years ago mdash will help launch the Novena at the invitation of parish priest Fr John Murray.On March , Sr Martina and Sr Elaine, a former BBC correspondent and a former barrister respectively, will share their faith story, entitled lsquoOur Friend Patrickrsquo.The Dean of Down, the Very Henry Hull is also to take part in an ecumenical celebration on March  while the Bishop of Down and Connor, the Most Rev Noel Treanor, will celebrate Sunday mass on March .Fr John Murray, PP, said the St Patrickrsquos celebration would remember all the thousands of people who have attended mass and celebrated the sacraments in the church in St Patrickrsquos Avenue since its foundation.ldquoIt is an occasion to give thanks for those countless lives of witness and faith and to look forward to the future with confidence and hope in Christ, he said.ldquoIn , Fr Patrick OrsquoKane and the parishioners of St Patrickrsquos could not have imagined the events of two world wars and the rise and fall of Communism, the Second Vatican Council and the many other huge milestones that have come to dominate the landscape that is the th century.ldquoThey could not have imagined that  years after the church was built that we are just emerging from a pandemic.

Patrick remains our friend in the Lord.ldquoDuring lockdown we as a community have experienced many challenges including isolation and this is a chance to reclaim the joy of community and strengthen our faith, the faith that our ancestors clung tightly to and which sustained them with hope and love.Sr Elaine added: ldquoThis is an amazing time to rebuild on the old foundations through St Patrickrsquos Novena. It is in unison with Godrsquos perfect timing, when Downpatrick and the world begins to open up after two years of lockdown.ldquoIt is a clear sign of St Patrickrsquos influence in our present time, working through the power of the Holy Spirit.The nave of St Patrickrsquos Church was built in  and since then the parish has flourished with a new extension built in .It features the largest shrine to St Patrick in Ireland, with mosaics telling the story of his le, augmented by stained glass windows featuring his le and the le of other Irish saints inspired by his Christian mission.The church spire was added in  and pilgrim walkers on St Patrickrsquos Way have been visiting the church to explore its rich history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"American singing legend Judy Collins on local radio show  ","story":"AMERICAN music legend Judy Collins will the special guest on the Chris Scott Show on FM Down Community Radio tonight at pm.The singer, songwriter and musician has enjoyed a career spanning seven decades mdash and still going strong.Judy talks to Chris about some aspects of her long career in the music business, her Irish roots and her new album which was released last week.

They help to develop the museum and its collection and act as its ambassadors within the community. Members organise relevant activities as well as supporting the museumrsquos own programme of events.These activities include lectures, tours, literary and musical events, for social, educational or fundraising purposes. The Friends make grants, from their own funds or by acting as a conduit for other grant-aiding bodies who are unable to give money directly to the Museum. Such grants are for curatorial or educational purposes.At the inaugural meeting of the Friends in  the curator, Dr Brian Turner, spoke briefly about the work of the museum and plans for the future.He emphasised that community support and participation was vital and was at the root of everything the museum stood for.The first committee was elected with Patrick Forde as chairman, Dr Maurice Hayes as vice-chairman, Conac Hanna as treasurer and Noel McCann as secretary. Other committee members included Professor Ronald Buchanan, Frank Maxwell and Wendy Osborne. Since then, many other local people have given their time and skills through the committee.The Friends come from all parts of our community and even further afield. The main source of income is through annual subions, with occasional gts. However, there is also some capital as a result of a direct grant from the Northern Ireland government in . This was given in recognition of the Friendsrsquo potential for improving community harmony through peaceful exploration of our common cultural heritage. It is estimated that they have given the museum about pound, towards a great iety of projects during the last  years.However, perhaps more important is the long-term commitment the Friends have shown to the museum. They give their time, goodwill, skills, knowledge, experience and advice, on a voluntary basis, to help the museum in many ways. With their close association to the Museum they have witnessed the reduction in staff and understood the impact of the proposed restructuring.Friends in the art world, such as Richard Croft, Betty McCord and Jim Manley, have supported the museum by generous donations of their own work. Some have used their contacts to acquire works with large discounts whilst others have been able to alert the Museum to items for sale in auctions.The Friends donated Mixed farm, Slievenaman, an oil painting by Tom Carr, to mark the th anniversary of the museum, in . In , they donated Mourne Hayfield, a watercolour by Chris Dearden, to mark the th anniversary of the museum.They also purchased Silent Valley, a watercolour by Jim Manley, in , Landscape, Tyrella, an oil painting by Daniel OrsquoNeill, in  and part funded Down Cathedral and Southwell School, tempura on board by Patric Stevenson, in .The pieces of glass made by Alison Lowry, and which can now be seen at the entrance to the Cell Block, was part funded to mark the th anniversary of Friends. The inidual pieces are representations of objects associated with the lives of prisoners held in this building. The Friends also supported a residency for Australian artist Christina Henri commemorating women prisoners transported from Down Gaol.Friends with musical connections have organised tin whistle classes. The Friends also paid for a local harpist to play in galleries on summer Sunday afternoons and for the choral society at a Christmas event.Keen gardeners have brought plants into the museum to sell and opened a private garden to visitors to raise money.Car boot sales were another popular method of fundraising and the museum courtyard provided a useful venue for several organised by the Friends.Technical, photographic and conservation projects have benefited over the years from the Friendsrsquo assistance. Equipment and materials included a laminator, scanner, digital camera and archival storage. A drone pilot course was funded.The loan of St Patrickrsquos Head shrine from another museum was only made possible by its prior conservation, which the Friends paid for. One of the most important projects was the initial cataloguing of the D J McNeill Collection, by means of a placement, largely supported by the Friends.Young people have been encouraged to enjoy learning about history by Friendsrsquo funding for prizes for school competitions, poster packs for schools, and programmes for The Young Archaeologistsrsquo Club. The Education Service was assisted by the purchase of a photocopier and replica pots for children to handle.Publications have always been an important part of the museumrsquos work, in disseminating information about the collection, for setting objects in their historic context and most importantly, their relationship to people. To this end, the Friends have match-funded the annual Down Survey, - and .They assisting with the publication of two townland maps, which were freely distributed to schools and community groups. Books included A man stepped out for death, Thomas Russell and County Down, a collaborative publication to mark thebicentenary of the United Irish Rising of  and Aspects of Audleystown by Brian Turner, a book designed to help iniduals and groups study their townlands. They initiated, researched, wrote and published a recipe book, Food for Friends, in ,with all profits going to the Friends.Many facets of the High Cross project were supported by the Friends, including filming the whole project and the making of the replica High Cross. Restoration of St Patrickrsquos Cross and the interpretation  were financially supported.Exhibitions have benefited from the Friendsrsquo support in recent years with a major contribution to the extension at the back of the site was signicant. This included paintings for the new Tea Room.Talks and lecture series have been organised both in in the museum and at other venues with all profits given to the Friends.And dozens more: from the purchase of trees and shrubs for the garden at the back of the site to the purchase of a Papal bull..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Aontú selects human rights activist to run in Assembly election  ","story":"AONTUacute is fielding a candidate in South Down in the May Assembly election.The party has confirmed that Rosemary McGlone will be its standard bearer when voters go to the polls in  weeksrsquo time to elect five MLAs to represent the constituency.Aontuacute says it views South Down as a key constituency and aims to challenge the Stormont ldquoestablishment parties and provide genuine opposition to the to the broken Stormont system.A nationalist and human rights activist, Ms McGlone is a secondary school teacher in Belfast and a mother of four young children.Her party says that like many nationalists, she felt no longer represented by Sinn Fein or the SDLP and that rather than let herself be disenfranchised with no one to vote for, she has taken a step forward so that people like her might have a voice in Stormont.Aontuacute says that like so many, Rosemary has been ldquofrustrated by Nationalist parties who have abandoned their communities and supported discriminatory policies.It says the final straw for the South Down candidate came when Sinn Feacutein and SDLP MLAs voted for abortion up until birth for children with disabilities. Aontuacute says Rosemary also opposes the de-prioritisation funding of hundreds of local schools that is contained in the Integrated Education Bill.Her party leader, Peader Toacuteibiacuten, said , people are on housing waiting lists, , on hospital waiting lists for longer than a year, a quarter of a million people are in poverty and Sinn Fein and SDLP MLAs have voted for abortion right up until the birth of the child.He declared: ldquoThat the DUP has torn down Stormont in the middle of these very real human crisis is wrong and it must not be allowed to happen again.ldquoAontuacute is the only political party calling for the reform of the democratic institutions to prevent any one party tearing them down again or any one party preventing an Executive being formed in the future.ldquoThese le and death issues are too important for Stormont to be crashed over and over again. We are also calling for the suspension of MLA salaries for the political parties who crash the democratic institutions or prevent Executives being formed.Mr Aontuacute described Ms McGlone as a le-long human rights activist and nationalist who stopped voting for the SDLP because ldquoit abandoned her and so many communities to pursue identity politics.He continued: ldquoRosemary will lead the fight to give a voice to the tens of thousands of people who currently have no representation in Co Down.

The conversion took UCD into a -point half time lead.The second half was dominated by Ballynahinch with the wind at their back and a big crowd roaring them on.Their maul was proving to be a real weapon and Kyle McCall was again the beneficiary with a try after  minutes after a superb maul.Tommy Donnan then had what seemed a certain try disallowed after another excellent maul, but when flanker Olly Loughead barged over on the hour mark to close the gap to eight points the home faithful could sense a famous win.However, UCD scored with their only attack of the second half through scrum half Richie Fahy to give the students some breathing space.Despite laying siege to the line, all the home side had to show for the last quarter was a penalty try with two minutes remaining and the students held on for victory and virtually assured their Division A status for -.Ballynahinch look destined for a nail-biting two-legged play-off against UCC to decide who goes down, but will hope to play themselves into better form over the final few weeks of the season.All support welcome at Garryowen this weekend.Ballynahinch : Nacho Cladera Crespo, Tom Stewart, Kyle McCall, Cormac Izuchukwu, Tom Martin, Tommy Donnan, Olly Loughead, Bradley Luney, Conor McAuley, Greg Hutley, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Rory Butler, Ronan Patterson, Conor Rankin, David Cooper, John Dickson, Kyle Gill, Gareth Gill, Ruari Meharg, Yasser Omar..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dougan goal cancels out Sam’s strike in derby  ","story":"THE local derby between Drumaness Mills and Killyleagh YC ended in a stalemate in quite horrendous conditions on Saturday.The Mills, who are currently on the back of a strong run of form and had won well at the reverse fixture a few weeks ago, would have been confident when welcoming old rivals Killyleagh for their Premier Division clash.The match at Meadowvale began at a high pace with lots of commitment shown by both sides in an effort to secure an early foothold in the game.In the early exchanges Rory Mason, Adam Keaney and then James McGivern all had half chances which they would have expected to have done better with.Somewhat against the run of play and with  minutes on the clock, Killyleaghrsquos Sam Carson rled the ball high into the top right hand corner of the net from the edge of the box with the home goalkeeper, Marc Reid, rooted to the spot. A fine goal at any level.Killyleagh were noticeably revitalised and buoyant following their goal, however, clever work from Callum Dougan on halfway sent Adam Kearney through in search of an equaliser with  minutes on the clock but he blazed over with the goal at his mercy.Killyleaghrsquos Conor Hamilton was becoming more and more influential in the game and continued to probe and prompt throughout, although he will be rueing his miss when he seemed better placed to score to put his side further ahead.On  minutes Rory Mason broke at pace and found Dougan, who forced a smart save from Aaron Carberry in the Killyleagh goal. Kearney, following up, trickled the rebound towards goal before it was hacked to safety before crossing the line.The Mills continued to press and a surging run down the right from Ben Campbell resulted in a fine ball across the face of goal but without anyone reacting it went out for a throw on the far side.Killyleagh had a corner in the th minute and in an example of the conditions, the now swirling wind took the ball directly out of play and with that the referee blew his whistle and brought the half to a close.Half-time: Drumaness Mills FC  Killyleagh YC .Clearly unimpressed with his sides first half showing, Drumaness manager, Mark Kerr, made two changes at half-time. Off went Rory Mason and Adam Kearney to be replaced with Eoin Rooney and Keegan Domican.As the game settled after the restart on  minutes, Campbell blazed a half chance over when well-placed following a corner for the home side.The next attack did bring the equaliser the home outfit craved. The ball fell to the feet of Callum Dougan after a Mills attack down the right looked like coming to nothing and he despatched it to the back of the net with aplomb. The clock ticked by with  minutes gone and both sides were now level.On  minutes Daniel Bell replaced Conor Carew in the engine room for The Mills and as the game heated up and became quite frantic around the  minute mark, McGivern was booked for two strong challenges in quick succession.As the game entered the final few minutes, Marc Reid made a top level save with an acrobatic reflex to push the ball onto the roof of the net when it didnrsquot seem possible showing shades of Gordon Banks.The away team were now pushing hard for the winner they craved and were blown up for an offside call on  minutes with Naseem Ouldhamiat through on goal.As the dust settled and a level of calm was restored the referee blew for full-time.A local derby which was keenly contested throughout and a draw was probably a fair result on the balance of play..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"First half nightmare for Ballynahinch at home  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH lost out to Portrush on home soil in their latest Ulster Intermediate League encounter at the weekend.lsquoHinch began strongly and on the attack from the first whistle as Alex Millar was quickly able to play the ball out from the back and up to Matthew Martin.The Ballynahinch player played the ball up to Kyle Patterson on the left wing, who was able to slot the ball in off the back post to put his side on the scoresheet.Portrush were quickly on the counter attack down the right-hand side only to be stopped by Ashley Brown and lsquokeeper Aaron Donnell.Portrush were determined to level the game and were able to slip the ball from the baseline through a crowded circle before putting the ball in at the back post.Leslie Harrison played the ball out to Scott Leetch on the right, who was able to pass up to Craig Harkness and over to Michael Carney and Jason Campbell up front.They were able to create chance after chance, but were denied by the Portrush lsquokeeper and their defence.lsquoHinch came out in the second quarter looking to add to the scoreline.

The part of the track closest to the residents will be some - metres away.But Shan Slieve Drive householders say that is too close. In their petition to planners they say that the nearest gardens to the track are just  metres away and  dwellings and two major residential homes for the elderly are within  metres of the site.ldquoThe noise generated by the use of the track is likely to be highly detrimental to residents over a wide area, they claim. ldquoSuch a track is likely to operate from Easter until the end of September at least at weekends and almost certainly daily from am until pm during July and August.

A number of owners want to leave the industry, but this will not let them get out, he added.Mr Curran said Northern Ireland fishermen were in dficulty, with some living on the breadline.Accusing the

allocation of funds and thus enrich the educational experience offered to our pupils, said Mr Hanna.ldquoWhat was not said, of course, was that the Government had tired of the antics of the teaching

Land at the rear of Russell Park is not deemed a flooding risk.Late last year, politicians said they are keen to see a wide-ranging development plan for the town centre location and while they accept that it may not be possible to deliver everything that will be in the blueprint at the same time, they want to aim high and also target potential funders to finance what will be an ambitious project.Downpatrick area councillors met with senior council officials last week to discuss proposals for the development of the park with the focus on maximising the opportunities that Dunleath offers.It has been agreed that a paper detailing plans for the new skateboard park and pump track will be outlined at a forthcoming meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee.A working group has been set up to oversee the future of the park and its members have taken a close look at the existing sports pitches, with many keen to provide at least one G or G pitch which would provide a facility that could be used all year round.Downpatrick councillor, Oonagh Hanlon, described the development plans for Dunleath as ldquoexciting and praised the local authorityrsquos sensible approach to maximise its potential.She also conceded that while parts of the park present challenges as they are included within a flood plain, there is agreement aiming local politicians on the way forward.ldquoWe need to press ahead with what is achievable in the short term at Dunleath Park, whilst keeping an eye on a longer-term strategy. I am pleased that Downpatrick area councillors can work collectively for progress in the area, she added.Itrsquos understood that details of Downpatrickrsquos first ever parkrun event are being finalised and that once the date of the K event has been confirmed, the event will become an annual event for runners of all abilities.Hugely popular across the globe, those working to bring the event to Downpatrick say it has the potential to provide the local economy with a boost, bringing in many competitors from outside the town.Downpatrick Town Committee is behind the ambitious plan for the new parkrun which it believes will bring the local community closer together and may encourage people who have never run before to get out and enjoy themselves in an event where there is no time limit and no one finishes last..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Recovery is possible to restore bond with you and eating food  ","story":"WITH the pandemic dictating to us over the last two years, there has been an increase for those struggling to manage their dficult feelings, sudden le changes, isolation and trying to gain a sense of control mdash which has resulted in an increase of cases for the treatment of eating disorders.Eating disorders, or a disordered pattern of eating, can arise when a person uses food to cope with painful situations or uncomfortable feelings.Problems with food develop when it is used for emotional rather than physical reasons, such as feelings of anxiety, anger or guilt. The food serves as a stress reliever and in many cases initially the person is not aware of what they are doing.In this day and age of dieting, health and fitness, it is sometimes dficult to ascertain the dference between someone who has an eating disorder and a person who is simply weight conscious.The main ingredient present in a person with an eating disorder is the use or abuse of food to cope with dficult feelings, whereas a weight conscious person may simply want to lose weight for a wedding, an occasion, to fit into an outfit.It is the psychological and emotional implications that separate the weight conscious person from the person with an eating disorder. Unfortunately, some embarking on a weight loss trail start out innocently to lose lsquoa few poundsrsquo, however over a period of time a personrsquos brain and body chemistry can be affected by the diet they have chosen and as a result the brain and bodybecome impaired.Possible causesThere is no single cause for eating disorders, as there are many factors pertaining to them. The common thread seems to be a supersensitive nature, low self esteem and an inability to respond appropriately to uncomfortable feelings.The good news is recovery is possible and a person can restore their relationship with themselves and with food. All iniduals have their own unique personal issues that contribute to their eating disorder, so treatment has to be tailored to the iniduals specic needs, personality and lestyle.Who develops disorders Anyone can develop an eating disorder, regardless of age, sex cultural background, etc, and it is not unusual for an eating disorder to surface in middle age. Research suggests that there may also be a genetic disposition to eating disorders and a link to certain personality types.However, there are certain factors pertaining to eating disorders and anyone can develop a disordered pattern of eating. A traumatic event, disordered perception, being abused, being bullied, a long term illness, a death, negative influences from a family member or a friend can all have a part to play in the symphony that can create issues around food.What are the categories There are several categories of eating disorders. However the main culprits are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and other related disorders.These disorders centre around extreme or potentially dangerous eating and weight control behaviours which include binge eating, starving, purging, chewing and spitting and over exercising.There are two less known eating disorders mdash night eating syndrome and orthorexia nervosamdash as well as further categories under the title of EDNOS , but today Irsquod Like to explore the three most common types of eating disorder.AnorexiaThe first case of anorexia was in  in France and the first paper on anorexia was written by Sir William Gull in .Anorexia is the relentless pursuit of low body weight either by curtailing food intake or restricting particular foods thought to be fattening. This can result in emaciation and the risk of collapse or death.Some people exercise compulsively to burn off the lsquoperceivedrsquo excess of calories from the small amount theydo manage to eat. The focus based on food is an attempt to cope with control and to feel some sense of power in their lives.It is not about simply wishing to be slim like models in magazines. Starvation causes the disorder to take control and this alters brain and body chemistry that results in further distortions, in thinking and emotional reasoning. As the illness takes more of a hold, a person starts to become exhausted as their energy levels are compromised due to lack of nutrition. This, together with an increase in negative energy, may account for the heaviness they feel.In all cases this heaviness is mistaken for fatness, hence they engage in a constant struggle to keep losing weight. It is a war on food that must be maintained despite the already severe weight loss that the person has incurred.Anorexia checklist:Weight loss in a short space of timeLoss of periods for womenFeeling cold all the timeDizzinessDry, rough, pale discoloured skinSevere restriction of foodFood rituals, such as chopping food into small pieces, counting bits of foodBloated stomach Loss of bone massMood swingsPerfectionistic attitudesInsecuritySelf-worth becomes based on what is eaten or not eatenIntense fear of gaining weightDistorted perception of body shape, weight, personality and amount of food eatenRigid and obsessive behaviourWearing baggy clothesAvoiding companyIn some cases some take laxativesBuzz from starving ndash sense of power or worthConviction that they are OK despite concerns of otherAs you can see, the above have far reaching effects on a personrsquos health and well-being, and as suchleft untreated can be fatal.The long term effects can lead to women becoming infertile or have dficulty getting pregnant. There is also a high risk of developing osteoporosis for both men and women.BulimiaThe term Bulimia nervosa literally means lsquoox hunger of nervous originrsquo. This hunger is driven by an emotional need that food cannot alone fill. Usually this person feels this void or gap or emptiness and they seek to use food to fill it. Unfortunately, as many find out, the emptiness cannot be filled by food, as it is emotional, physical and spiritual.Sufferers characteristically binge eat or over eat and end up feeling bloated, worse, too full. After their eating episode they then vomit and or take laxatives in a bid to prevent themselves from gaining weight. Others also over exercise in a bid to burn unwanted calories. As with anorexia, control and the abuse of food to cope are also present.Bulimia usually follows dieting and starts later than anorexia mdash in late adolescence. It may follow anorexia. It can continue for many yearsleft untreated, thus many older women have the illness. The period after childbirth is another time when women are at risk.Bulimia is also associated with low self esteem, lack of confidence and over-evaluation of weight and shape, and a need to control weight. Bulimic behaviour is very addictive as, while vomiting and exercising the brain releases endorphins, chemicals which are the bodyrsquos natural pain killers.The ritual confers a sense of emotional release, so what starts off as a way of controlling calories, becomes a way of getting this emotional release ndash which will be repeated whenever a person feels emotional or physical stress.Bulimia checklist:Frequent weight changes.Sore throat, swollen glands, tooth decay, bad breath.Preoccupation with an overestimation of body shape and weight.VomitingLaxative abuseRigid and harsh exercise regimesFear of putting on weightDepressionMood swingsElectrolyte and fluid imbalancesPoor skin condition and hair lossLethargy and tirednessHeart palpitationsInternal organs damageUncontrollable urges to eat vast amounts of foodAnxiety, guilt and shame attached to self and behaviourFeelings of isolationBuzz from vomiting, sense of release reliefBuzz from perceived weight lossEasy weight gain.Again, like anorexia, the above can have a far reaching effect on mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well being. In extreme cases bulimia causes heart failure because when a person induces vomiting, they lose potassium from the body.Potassium is a mineral which regulates the sdrenal glands, the nervous system, the heart and energy levels of the body. The adrenal glands in the body are responsible for handling stress effectively. Other dangers include rupture of the stomach, choking, drying up of saliy glands.Binge eatingLike bulimia, binge eating disorder has only recently been recognised as a distinct condition. It was in  that it was first acknowledged as an eating disorder in its own right.BED is very similar to bulimia in all respects, except that the person does not purge to dispose of unwanted calories. It is believed that there are more people suffering from BED than anorexia or bulimia.People who binge or overeat and who do not purge usually struggle with their weight, although not all are overweight. Being overweight , of course brings with it the risk of a host of other physical illnesses and most sufferers feel depressed, out of control and ashamed of their behaviour.Binge eating checklist:Binging in secretEating very rapidlyEmotional eatingCanrsquot stop when had enoughSensing the eating behaviour is not normalEating despite feeling very fullsometimesFeeling out of control when eatingShame, depression, guiltCompulsive eating when not hungryFantasies about being a better person when thin.As many people with weight issues are judged by society, a supportive and nurturing environment is necessary in order for the inidual to feel safe. Here again, education is a vital component of recovery from any eating disorder. Therapeutic interventions work at both physical and emotional levels to deal with the urges, cravings, to change eating habits, look at thought patterns and rules, becoming more emotionally resilient. Ultimately treatment is available that helps each inidual become empowered, recover and move forward with their lives.If you have any queries or would like to arrange an appointment please call   or email empower@post www.empowercounsellingni.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Top dancer Anna qualifies for World Championships  ","story":"LOCAL Irish dancers have proven themselves to be a step above the rest once again.Members of the Crossgar-based Scoil Rince an Chroiacute dance school enjoyed plenty of success at the Kelly Hendry Feis in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Mid-Ulster Grades Feis in Dungannon.Thirty-five dancers from the school took to the stage at both locations with dancers excelling in both the grades system and championships.The school ed home with  first places,  top five places and a host of trophies and sashes.The schoolrsquos success comes of the back of a very successful Ulster Championships in Ballybofey in October.Anna McGlew qualied for the World Championships to be held in Belfast at Easter and Sean Gordon achieved fth place, reaching a podium place at his first Ulsters, having only started to compete four months prior.Teacher Briacuted McKinney said: ldquoWhilst acknowledging the ious pandemic-related challenges brought to us in  and early this year, the great class spirit and support for each other helped drive our ious success both last year and this year to date.Co-teacher Maura Davidson commented: ldquoThe results are down to the commitment, dedication and support from our dancers and families.The school now prepares for their first championship feis in Downpatrick later this month and the World Championships at Easter.Classes continue weekly at the studio in Crossgar.

It is a book that every Christian should read especially those who are full time in the Lord’s service. As Bonar’s inspirational ‘Banner of Truth’ publication states on the dust cover of the  edition: “His diary and le is one of the great treasures left to the Church from the th century, and deserves to be widely and eagerly read”.On April , , Andrew Bonar made this entry: “Spared to see my th year, while others are taken”. The reason that he wrote those words was because so many of his friends and family had been taken away in death while they were still very young.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It is a question that I have been caused to consider earnestly myself in recent days and you would be wise to consider it also. Ask yourself just now: “Why am I spared and others taken ” Why has God allowed you to live so long – when he has taken away some of your friends and loved ones in the prime of le  If you are a believer then there is only one answer to that question. The Lord has kept you alive , not so that you can make more money or make a name for yourself, but because your work for Him is not yet finished.There is still a work for you to do for Christ. The first time American acclaimed evangelist D. L. Moody met fellow US evangelist R. A. Torrey he said to him: “Young man you had better get to work for the Lord”. That is still the Lord’s message for you today. He would say: “Go work today in my vineyard’” . Get busy for the Lord while you still have the opportunity.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Prior to being in Lurgan, the organisation’s administrative base was located in Dublin and Belfast.The Royal Black moved out of Brownlow House in  to temporary premises in Loughgall, beside the Museum of Orange Heritage at Sloan’s House.Now, the institution is looking forward to taking up residence in their own purpose-built administrative centre.“The opening of our new headquarters will be a landmark day in the history of the Royal Black Institution,” said Rev Anderson.“This project has been one of the biggest and most important ever undertaken by the Imperial Grand Black Chapter of the British Commonwealth.“The need for our own headquarters was discussed and agreed in , we purchased the Loughgall building in , renovation work began in May , and I’m delighted to say we’re ready to cut the ribbon on Saturday, April .“It has been a long road to get to this point, and there have been many challenges along the way. “We had originally hoped to open the building in , so that the unveiling would form part of our celebrations for the centenary of Northern Ireland. However, the Covid pandemic wreaked havoc with our work schedule. But we were fairly relaxed about the delay as our focus was always about completing the building to a high standard rather than rushing to a completion date.“There are so many people to thank for all their hard work but I would like to take this opportunity to pay special tribute to the contractors, Weir Bros Construction, for their professionalism and attention to detail, and to our own clerk of works, Edgar Patterson, and quantity surveyor, Keith Anderson, and the entire Royal Black HQ project team, for their passion, commitment and expertise over the last few years.“Thanks to the efforts of everyone involved, we now have modern headquarters from which we can proudly maintain our stand for the Reformed Faith and strengthen our Christian and charitable outreach.”The building itself has an interesting history. At one stage it was a public house known as the Rock Tavern. Afterwards, a temperance advocate, Cecilia Cope, turned it into a coffee house. A later inhabitant was Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer, a senior British Army officer and former chief of the Imperial General Staff, who fought in both world wars. In more recent times it housed a popular antiques business.The grand opening will also include the opening of a ‘Leaders’ Legacy’ exhibition on the lives of past sovereign grand masters, and the unveiling and dedication of a bust of Sir Norman Stronge.

They were quite humorous, talking about not stealing, but borrowing, a pony and taking it for a ride, it was probably quite normal back then.”Isaac continued: “When he passed away, I took the recordings and combined them with music and sound design and put it into a small personalised wooden box to give to my mum as a gt. “She had no idea that I had done any of this, and her reaction was an indication of the enormous potential that personalised listening experiences could offer to family members and patients in a similar situation. That’s when I had the idea for the ‘From My Perspective’ project.” Isaac is studying a PhD looking at ‘Creative Arts for Palliative Care’ based at the Sonic Arts Research Centre, a project which involves recording interviews with day hospice patients. He said: “The main hospice I was working at was Marie Curie, I was able to do this with  participants over the summer, it was a great experience.“I combine elements of their voice, music, and sound design into a memory box which can then be played back through the device’s in-built speakers.“My aim was for the recording to last around  minutes to an hour, so I’d maybe record up to two hours and I’d edit it down to the best bits and cut out the bits where I was talking. I’d also give them the option to have the full unedited version.“Some patients want to use this as an opportunity to leave an advance directive regarding personal matters, whereas others wanted to use it as an opportunity to leave a memento that can be shared amongst family and used to help facilitate communication and shared experiences. “My hope for this project is that someday it could be implemented as a full-time service within hospices around the world.” Isaac’s work will be showcased at Belfast Imagine Festival in conjunction with Marie Curie Hospice on March .Annahilt  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular‘Major rally’ details announced as unionists voice regret at Sinn Fein anonymity rulingPSNI arrest man after reports of woman in distressPSNI issue update on suspected abduction of young maleSinn Fein man behind major Brexit Protocol legal challege will remain anonymous, court rulesWar in Ukraine: The best hope for humanity is that President Putin’s generals oust him, says Colonel Tim CollinsMost PopularBest pancake pans UK : from non-stick to cast iron, these pans will produce perfect pancakes every timeBest men’s wetsuits UK : great suits for surfing and open water swimmin from RipCurl, Finnisterre, ZoneBest women’s walking trousers for hiking : hiking trousers reviewed, from Arc-Teryx, Jack Wolfskin, AcaiBest high street wedding dresses UK :  styles of beautul, cheap wedding dress for every type of brideBest men’s waterproof hiking jacket UK : dry walking jackets from Rab, Columbia, Berghaus, Arc’Teryx                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported exclusively on our sister site The National on St Davids Day, the Cardf Capital Regiongroup of local authorities has bought the site of Wales last coal-fired power station for £ million. CCR says it is committing £. million to the project in total, which includes the purchase price.The other £. million will be spent on \"demolition, remediation, and re-development\".The contracts have now been exchanged between Cardf Capital Region and energy giant RWE, the seller. The distinctive Aberthaw Power Station as seen from the air. Photo: Siriol Grfiths The Cardf Capital Region have released a proposed \"master plan\" for the redevelopment of the site, which they say \"will take several years to come to fruition given the nature of and complexities involved in the transitioning process\".In sum, CCR says it will:Support the production of renewable and green energy projectsProvide an accompanying battery storage facility to support the green energy projectsProduce a zero-carbon manufacturing cluster which will include green hydrogen production facilitiesProvide a green energy innovation centre to promote innovation, growth, knowledge and community interaction with the zero-carbon future of WalesBe responsible for the development and maintenance of a bio-erse ecology park which will include a visitor centre, providing amenities to the local communityCreate the correct conditions to support industrial de-carbonisation and future giga-plant facilities.Cardf Capital Region also says the project has \"the potential to create thousands of direct, indirect and induced jobs, along with local supply chain and upskilling benefits\", though no further details were supplied as to what that means in practical terms. An artists impression of the Aberthaw Power Station site created by London real estate giant, Reef Group for Cardf Capital Region The master plan of the site produced by London real estate giant Reef Group on behalf of Cardf Capital Region The CCR goes on to say that it will \"maintain a strong commitment to engage and involve local community stakeholders in order to develop an open, inclusive and participative ethos as soon as the commercially sensitive considerations have been addressed.\"There are areas of the site which require ongoing custodianship, in respect of nature, bioersity and managing the overall ecology of the site, which will be best achieved in partnership with community.\"The Aberthaw nature reserve. The lagoon is where the ancient Aberthaw harbour was situated before it was destroyed to make way for the power station. Photo: Siriol Grfiths The group also says that its redevelopment plan will \"commit to safeguarding and developing the Nature Reserve, working with colleagues in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to ensure effective plans are put in place. In the interim, whilst plans are worked through, commitment is given to ensure this ecologically valuable component of the site is protected and, wherever possible, further enhanced and augmented\".However, Cardf Capital Region, despite promising to work with local residents in the future, stops short of making specic reference to concerns raised by members of the nearby community recently. Those concerns centre around what will happen to the  metre high pulverised ash mound, the sea wall being breached by the tide, and problems with traffic due to poor local transport infrastructure. The long Aberthaw Power Station ash mound, m high. The smoke stack can be seen in the background. Photo: Siriol Grfiths \"Well believe these plans when we see them,\" Paul Turner told The National. He has been living in the shadow of the power station since  and says that since then, he and his we Sara have seen many ideas come and go, including nuclear power and tidal energy. \"Everybody who lives near that site knows how toxic it is. The ash tip is full of asbestos from when they demolished the original A power station. And the site gets flooded whenever theres a spring tide or a storm, ask anyone who has worked there. Thatll only get worse as the years go by.\"Will £ million keep the tide from drowning that site  Id say RWE are laughing all the way to the bank.\"The Climate Central Coastal Risk Screening Tool predicts that the site will be under water by , with flooding reaching as far inland as St Hilarys There are similar concerns from Barry Town Councillor, Dennis Clarke: \"The ambition for the Vale to access clean, green, high value employment is commendable but this site could not be sold to private industry. The likely reason the site was regarded as unsaleable might be the cost of dealing with tidal flooding, clearing the signicant level of contamination, removing the slag heap, identied as dangerous by RWE.\"Its well known that the road access is completely insufficient, especially bearing in mind the Vale and the Welsh Government persist in supporting a too large, unviable development at Model Farm\"I hope the CCR releases the papers that will show why they believe this site is suitable for any development beyond reinstating what was in place before the power station was built.\"A map produced by London real estate giant Reef Group in  depicting so-called major assets nearbyIn its statement, the CCR describes the Aberthaw site as having \"strong strategic links with other major assets, including Bro Tathan Business Park, Cardf Airport, and the overarching St Athan Enterprise Zone – one of the few sites in the UK capable of accommodating large-scale lithium-ion battery production\".Last month, the Welsh Government was accused of having let a proposed gigafactory project at St Athan \"slip throughfingers\" by Welsh Conservative South Wales Central MS Andrew RT Davies. It followed an announcement by car battery manufacturer, Britishvolt, that it was creating a factory in Northumberland, whereas St Athan had been its original preferred location. March  : Aberthaw Power Station as photographed from the Wales Coast Path. The site is currently badly flooded in the wake of recent storms and spring tides. Photo: Siriol Grfiths CCRs plans make no specic reference to tidal energy at Aberthaw either, despite the group having earmarked the site as being \"perfect for that type of facility\" last summer. By October , it was also reported that a new commission was being set up to explore building a barrage across the Severn estuary for tidal energy CCR is a part of that commission. However, a statement supplied by Welsh Government Economy Minister, Vaughan Gething, does moot the possibility of tidal energy: \"The proposed plan for Aberthaw is positive news which fits well with our commitment to develop tidal lagoon projects and support ideas that can help Wales become a world centre for emerging tidal technologies\".Mr Gethings enthusiasm is echoed by the UK governments Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, David TC Davies, who is the Conservative MP for Monmouth: \"The UK Government’s investment in the Cardf Capital Region will deliver thousands of jobs at Aberthaw and help put Wales on course for an economic recovery from the pandemic.\"The current s of the Cardf Capital Region - including any activity at Aberthaw - will eventually move into the new South East Wales Corporate Joint Committee .Three other Corporate Joint Committees will cover the rest of Wales in the south-west, the north, and the central area of the country.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I can’t wait to hear what the children think of it.“This new school building will provide a modern teaching and learning environment for staff and pupils, as well as a range of facilities for the local community.”The design includes solar  with battery storage, an air source heat pump, electric vehicle charging points, storage space for bicycles and scooters, and green habitat areas.Contractors ISG began building the school in January last year, which forms part of the council’s wider £ million programme of new school buildings across the Vale.Cllr Burnett added: “The council has made a climate commitment through our Project Zero initiative, which aims to make the organisation carbon neutral by . Delivering schools like this, which are extremely environmentally friendly, is a key part of that pledge.“This is the latest project in our Sustainable Communities for Learning programme, a far-reaching body of work intended to transform educational facilities across the Vale.”Protests were sparked by the decision to relocate Llancarfan Primary School from its village setting five miles down the road to Rhoose, with some parents opposing what they saw as the closure of a rural school. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This will include a regular annual vacination programme, the Welsh Government has said.: Three Covid deaths reported in Wales - more than  new cases in Gwent.It comes as Mr Drakeford has said that Wales will remain at alert level zero for the next three weeks, with no further changes to Covid regulations planned before March .Then, all legal measures could be removed, should the public health situation remain stable, the first minister said.“We’ve been living in the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic for two long years,” he said. “It has touched all our lives – across Wales, families and communities have made many sacrices to keep themselves and their loved ones safe.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityFlammable cladding was found on Lydstep Flats in Llandaff North in March , following concerns about fire safety in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire.Cardf council removed the cladding in December later that year, leaving residents suffering from cold flats, poor insulation and black mould.Now contractors ISG have started to replace that cladding, with the work expected to last until summer next year.Councillor Lynda Thorne, cabinet member for housing and communities, said: “I’m so glad, as I know all the Lydstep residents are, that contractors are now on site to begin replacing the cladding that was removed because it didn’t meet current fire safety standards.“The cladding we’re using to overclad the three blocks is of the highest level of fire safety.”The work includes new windows and upgrading balconies for the  flats. Meanwhile, residents in council flats in Butetown are still waiting for contractors to begin installing replacement cladding, with no start date announced yet.Flats at Loudon House and Nelson House in Butetown were also found to have flammable cladding in the wake of the Grenfell fire.Delays to both the council flats in Llandaff North and Butetown were due to inflation caused by Brexit and the pandemic, according to the council, as well as changes to the safety testing rules for new cladding. The estimated cost of replacing cladding at Lydstep doubled from £. million to £ million.Cllr Thorne added: “Progress on this work has been affected by signicant cost rises due to Brexit and inflationary pressures in the building industry, as well as the impact of the extensive testing and regulation framework for cladding solutions.“Throughout this time, we have been so grateful to the residents for their patience as we worked on finding the right solution for the three blocks, and it’s great to see contractors on site and work underway.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We do have systems in place already, but they are not integrated, and many are coming to the end of their le, as they have been superseded by newer technology.“We want to reduce harmful emissions, improve air quality and make Cardf a healthier city to live and work in. One of the best ways to do that is to change the way we move around the city, encouraging public transport, cycling and walking as preferred ways of getting around.“By , we would like to see % of all journeys made by sustainable forms of transport. To do that we will need to double the number of people travelling by bike or by bus. To achieve this, we need better infrastructure which is managed by an integrated, intelligent transport system.“It would act as the nerve centre ensuring bus corridors, cycleways and improved pedestrian crossings and pavements are recognised as a key part of the network, and helping to make travel on Cardf’s roads as efficient as possible.”One goal in the new policy is integrated ticketing, which would see people taking public transport be able to use the same ticket for a train and a bus, similar to in London..removeA new traffic control centre would be built for council staff, emergency services, bus and train companies, and enforcement officers. The new control centre would help monitor traffic across the city, respond to incidents quicker, reducing congestion.The A will pilot a ‘smart corridor’ scheme with buses given priority over cars. If successful, these could be rolled out on other main roads in Cardf.A public consultation on the intelligent transport system is expected to take place in summer, before getting signed off by the cabinet in autumn.Cllr Wild added: “Through the development of the transport user app, integrated ticketing and smart technology, residents and commuters will be better informed, so they themselves can make informed decisions on the best way to travel on any given day at any given time.“Our draft strategy looks at the use of data and technology to reduce congestion, incentivise active travel to make our highway network more efficient, and will help deal with incidents on the highway more effectively.“The opening of the bus station in  will act as a trigger point to implement new services and technology, so it is important that we do this work now.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
